        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH) is a key feature of Hakim's disease (synonymous with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus; iNPH). However, it previously had been only subjectively evaluated. PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the usefulness of MRI indices, derived from deep learning segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces, for DESH detection and to establish their optimal thresholds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively enrolled a total of 1009 participants, including 77 patients diagnosed with Hakim's disease, 380 healthy volunteers, 163 with mild cognitive impairment, 256 with Alzheimer's disease, and 217 with other types of neurodegenerative diseases. DESH, ventriculomegaly, tightened sulci in the high convexities, and Sylvian fissure dilatation were evaluated on three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI by radiologists. The total ventricles, high-convexity part of the subarachnoid space, and Sylvian fissure and basal cistern were automatically segmented using the CSF Space Analysis application (FUJIFILM Corporation). Moreover, DESH, Venthi, and Sylhi indices were calculated based on these 3 regions. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of these indices and region volumes (volume ratios) for DESH detection were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 1009 participants, 101 (10%) presented with DESH. The DESH, Venthi, and Sylhi indices performed well with 95.0%-96.0% sensitivity and 91.5%-96.8% specificity at optimal thresholds. All patients with Hakim's disease were diagnosed with DESH, despite variations in severity. In patients with Hakim's disease, with or without Alzheimer's disease, the DESH index and total ventricular volume were significantly higher compared to patients with Alzheimer's disease, although the total intracranial cerebrospinal fluid volume was significantly lower. CONCLUSION: DESH, Venthi, and Sylhi indices, and the volumes and volume ratios of the ventricle and high-convexity part of the subarachnoid space computed using deep learning were useful for the DESH detection that may help to improve the diagnosis of Hakim's disease (ie, iNPH).",

        "ArticleTitle": "Beyond stroke therapy, neuroaid (a chinese herbal) has an effect on cognition and neurogenesis, a bibliometric study.",
        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: NeuroAiD, also known as MLC601 or MLC901, is a Chinese herbal combination used worldwide for stroke treatment. It contains herbal components and five hewan components. MLC601 contains herbal components and hewan components, while MLC901 has a similar herbal composition. NeuroAiD is used to support neurologic recovery after stroke and to aid cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease. Studies show that NeuroAiD has potential in treating Alzheimer's disease and is beneficial in both local and global stroke models and in the Kortikal culture. However, there is limited bibliometric research on NeuroAiD, which is a method of collecting data from published articles to analyze developments and trends in the field of research. This research contributes significantly to the literature and helps develop more effective stroke treatment strategies. METHODS: In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords neuroaid. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: The research trend found are documents by year, most relevant sources, factorial map of the most cited documents, factorial map of The documents with the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, documents by affiliation, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, topic dendogram, and world cloud. CONCLUSIONS: The study investigates the potential of Neuroaid, a neuroprotective drug, for stroke prevention and cognitive function enhancement. It uses terms like \"cognition\" and \"neurogenesis\" to highlight its potential. While the study's focus may be limited, it provides valuable insights into research direction and potential areas of neuroaid for stroke treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Superficial white matter (SWM) U-fibers contain considerable structural connectivity in the human brain; however, related studies are not well-developed compared to the well-studied deep white matter (DWM). Conventionally, SWM U-fiber is obtained through DWM tracking, which is inaccurate on the cortical surface. The significant variability in the cortical folding patterns of the human brain renders a conventional template-based atlas unsuitable for accurately mapping U-fibers within the thin layer of SWM beneath the cortical surface. Recently, new surface-based tracking methods have been developed to reconstruct more complete and reliable U-fibers. To leverage surface-based U-fiber tracking methods, we propose to create a surface-based U-fiber dictionary using high-resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We first identify the major U-fiber bundles and then build a dictionary containing subjects with high groupwise consistency of major U-fiber bundles. Finally, we propose a shape-informed U-fiber atlasing method for robust SWM connectivity analysis. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our shape-informed atlasing method can obtain anatomically more accurate U-fiber representations than state-of-the-art atlas. Additionally, our method is capable of restoring incomplete U-fibers in low-resolution dMRI, thus helping better characterize SWM connectivity in clinical studies such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).",

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are versatile, self-renewing and capable of differentiating into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, playing a pivotal role in both embryonic development and adult neurogenesis. In the central nervous system (CNS), NSCs primarily reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the sub-granular layer of the dentate gyrus, where they give rise to neural progenitors and subsequently to neurons and glial cells. Oligodendrocytes play a crucial role in the CNS function and myelin sheath formation, which is essential for rapid neuronal signal transmission. Astrocytes contribute to brain homeostasis by regulating lipid metabolism and providing metabolic support to neurons. Sphingolipids and phospholipids are integral to neural cell membrane structure and function, influencing processes such as neurogenesis, cell signaling, and synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, the ApoE4 allele impacts lipid metabolism, affecting the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. This paper explores the role of various cell types and lipids in the CNS, emphasizing the importance of lipid metabolism in maintaining neural function and the implications for neurodegenerative conditions.",

The interactions between Tau and membrane lipids, including phospholipids like DOPC, DPPC, and proteins such as Apo E4, play a significant role in Tau aggregation. These interactions modulate Tau's structure, stabilization, and aggregation kinetics. Phospholipase C (PLC) and DEPC also influence Tau aggregation through signaling pathways and preservation of RNA integrity, respectively. Membrane lipid composition affects Tau-membrane interactions, which can promote Tau fibrillization and propagation, contributing to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other Tauopathies. The disruption of lipid homeostasis by Apo E4, alterations in membrane fluidity and integrity by DPPC, and the influence of phospholipids on BBB functionality are significant in understanding Tau pathology.",

        "AbstractText": "Tau protein accumulation is one of the characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their accumulation is driven by the formation of intermediate toxic oligomers of Tau to the highly ordered neurofibrillary tangles. Cellular machineries engage different types of proteins such as, chaperone-co-chaperones complex, ubiquitin, kinases, proteases etc., to clear the aberrantly accumulated Tau protein which otherwise would cause neuronal death. In the milieu of proteotoxicity, it would be significant for the cell to follow a specific path for Tau clearance. Under this circumstance, cells express key proteins and other accessory proteins specific to the pathway. This is known to be dependent on the post-translational modifications and mutations associated with Tau. The processes involved maintenance of proteins homeostasis in cells collectively called proteostasis. The proteostasis involve the synthesis of proteins by ribosomes, protein folding mostly by chaperons and the degradation of improperly folded or unwanted proteins. Autophagy is the mechanism to eradicate unwanted, non-functional and toxic proteins from the cell. Proteostasis plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal cellular environment in the expense of considerable amount of energy.

The protein oligomers are the short-lived but, highly reactive species which mediate toxicity, synaptic loss, neurodegeneration and ultimately cognitive decline. Tau oligomers can propagate through various pathway viz. the exosomal pathway, neurotransmission, cell-to-cell junction, bulk endocytosis and receptor-mediated internalization etc. The preparation, isolation and detection of oligomers were of immense importance in the current field for designing therapeutics and diagnostics. Microglia are the prime immune cells in brain which maintain the homeostasis via synaptic surveillance and tissue-remodeling. But, the senescent microglia mediate pro-inflammation, oxidative damage and phagocytosis in diseased brain. The extracellular Tau oligomers were found to interact with microglial purinergic receptor P2Y12 which then led to microglial migration, activation and phagocytosis via various remodeled actin structure. P2Y12 receptor mediates Tau oligomers-induced microglial chemotaxis by localizing with migratory actin structures such as- filopodia, lamellipodia, podosome etc. These beneficial roles of P2Y12 in microglial chemotaxis, actin remodeling and Tau clearance can be intervened as a therapeutic target in AD.",

This paper aims to tackle a situation when precisely labeled samples are limited in the training set due to cost or availability constraints, whereas there could be an abundance of samples with imprecise labels. We focus on imprecise labels that are intervals, i.e., one can know that the a sample belongs to an interval of labels but cannot know which unique label it has. This situation is quite common in health care datasets due to limitations of the diagnostic instrument, sparse clinical visits, or/and patient dropout. Limited research has been done to develop OL models with imprecise/interval labels. We propose a new Hybrid Ordinal Learner (HOL) to integrate samples with both precise and interval labels to train a robust OL model. We also develop a tractable and efficient optimization algorithm to solve the HOL formulation. We compare HOL with several recently developed OL methods on four benchmarking datasets, which demonstrate the superior performance of HOL. Finally, we apply HOL to a real-world dataset for predicting the speed of progressing to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) based on a combination of multi-modality neuroimaging and demographic/clinical datasets. HOL achieves high accuracy in the prediction and outperforms existing methods. The capability of accurately predicting the speed of progression to AD for each individual with MCI has the potential for helping facilitate more individually-optimized interventional strategies.",

Our results demonstrate that MedGraphNet matches and often outperforms traditional single-relation approaches, particularly in scenarios with isolated or sparsely connected nodes. The model shows generalizability to external datasets, achieving high accuracy in identifying disease-gene associations and drug-phenotype relationships. Notably, MedGraphNet accurately inferred drug side effects without direct training on such data. Using Alzheimer's disease as a case study, MedGraphNet successfully identified relevant phenotypes, genes, and drugs, corroborated by existing literature.

It has several functions within the nervous system, placing its physiological activities, biochemical characteristics as well as therapeutic possibilities to their proper perspective. Endogenously produced by cystathione beta-synthase (CBS), cystathione gamma-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) enzymes, H2S is a unique naturally occurring substance that contains multiple biological activities; it is anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic. Such activity allows H2S to reduce oxidative stress, which limits mechanisms of cell death and prevents disruption of mitochondria and thus neuronal injury. H2S can also be regarded as a neuromodulator because it interacts with and affects the glutamatergic, dopaminergic and GABAergic systems at the synaptic level as well as on neurotransmitter systems and synapse dynamics. It modulates synaptic transmission and its plasticity which is essential for cognitive as well as motor activities and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects which are helpful in the progress of the neurodegenerative condition. Recently gathered some evidence emphasizes as well the possible use of H2S in therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke. In the models of Alzheimer's disease, H2S is able to reduce the toxicity of amyloid-beta peptides and improve cognitive performance. In Parkinson's disease, it protects dopaminergic neurons and reduces the severity of motor deficits. Moreover, H2S provides protection in ischemic stroke models through decrease of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Clinical practice with H2S-based therapies seems to have certain hurdles even if preclinical results are promising. Aside from stabilizing H2S in a biologically active form, developing a delivery system for H2S appears a challenge as well. This review will attempt to summarize the existing studies on H2S as neuroprotective and neuromodulatory agents, and their avenues of future use and development.",

This study included 30 DS cases (13-18\u00a0years old) with full trisomy 21 in addition to 30 healthy age-matched controls. The cognitive decline in DS subjects was evaluated using the short form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (Short IQCODE).

        "AbstractText": "Parcellation of mesh models for cortical analysis is a central problem in neuroimaging. Most classical and deep learning methods have requisites in terms of mesh topology, requiring inputs that are homeomorphic to a sphere (i.e., no holes or handles). Topology correction algorithms do exist, but their computational complexity is quadratic with the size of the topological defects - sometimes hours, effectively precluding segmentation of incorrect meshes, including those derived from imperfect segmentations or obtained from inherently noisy modalities like surface scanning. Furthermore, deep learning mesh segmentation also struggles surface scans of brains because they are relatively nondescript and require modeling of longer-range dependencies. Here we propose \"pseudo-render-inverse-render\" (PRIR), a novel perspective on cortical mesh parcellation that effectively reframes the problem as a 2D segmentation task using an direct-inverse rendering framework. Our approach: (i) renders the mesh from a number of perspectives, projecting the three components of the face normal vectors to a three-channel image; (ii) segments these images with U-Nets; (iii) maps the 2D segmentations back to vertices (inverse rendering); and (iv) aggregates the information from multiple views, postprocessing the output with a Markov Random Field to ensure smoothness and segmentation of occluded areas. PRIR is not affected by mesh topology and easily captures long-range dependencies with the U-Nets. Our results demonstrate: state-of-the-art accuracy on topologically correct white matter meshes; equally accurate performance on simulated surface scans; and robust segmentation of real surface scans.",

Despite mounting evidence that genetic risk effect sizes vary by population, most research on the genetics of AD has examined only data sets of individuals with European ancestry. In this study, we investigate the variable performance and transferability of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) by deriving a PRS from analyses of AD for various race and ethnic categories and applying this across groups using a k-fold cross-validation approach. METHODS: After quality control and application of inclusion criteria, we analyzed 11,254 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Release 3 with 3 predominant self-identified race/ethnicity groups: Hispanic individuals (n = 2,207), non-Hispanic Black individuals (n = 2,437), and non-Hispanic White individuals (n = 6,610). For each group, a 5-fold cross-validation approach was used to perform a genome-wide association study (training) and construct PRS estimates (test). This approach allowed for consideration of within-group and across-group PRS performance. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each race/ethnicity-specific PRS within each cross-validation fold. Various PRS criteria were considered, including rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the APOE region in calculation, sex-specific PRSs, and different sample sizes of training and test groups, and their effects were examined through goodness-of-fit metrics in reduced and full models. RESULTS: Across all participant groups, the PRS trained in the same race/ethnicity category as the test group nearly exclusively outperformed the other PRSs with considerable benefit in the Hispanic group. The range of AUCs across iterations was also greater when applying PRSs from other groups. These findings were consistent after inclusion of APOE, sex, and age covariates and through different PRS generation criteria. DISCUSSION: In this study, we demonstrated the variable performance of AD PRSs within race/ethnicity groups and the weakness in transferability across groups, accounting for different criteria in PRS calculation.

        "AbstractText": "Psychotropics are currently developed and marketed with a limited understanding of their mechanism of action. The notion that protein kinase C (PKC) activity is highly relevant to learning and memory function stems from experiments in the 1980s, which associated protein kinase alpha (pka) and pkc to animal models of associative learning, opening an area of exploration for psychotropic development. The PKC family consists of several isoforms, including PKC alpha, beta1, beta1, gamma, delta and epsilon among others. In particular, PKC gamma (PRKCG) is highly brain-expressed and is singled out as a candidate for modulation in psychiatric illness. With hundreds of identified substrates, PRKCG affects multiple pathways relevant for regulation of neuronal health. In this review, converging lines of evidence are presented in the context of psychotropic drug action, which point to downregulation of PKC activity as a potential common mechanism across several psychiatric disorders. Using this mechanism through more targeted psychotropic action may then be used to develop agents that further ameliorate psychiatric symptom expression. Psychotropics including fluoxetine, tricyclics, lithium, valproate, ketamine and others are explored in relation to their effect of PKC, finding that across all drugs examined, a downregulation with chronic-but not acute-use constitutes their putative effect in ameliorating symptoms. This effect is compounded by findings that suggest that PKCs, and PRKCG in particular, promote neuroplastic effects by their downregulation. This effect is in contrast to PKC activators, which have been used in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Cross-disorder mechanisms need to continue to be explored in neuropsychiatric illness and targeted treatments developed in turn to address treatment-resistant conditions.",

However, the exact nature of AD's relationship with white matter anatomical deterioration is not fully understood at a systemic level. To investigate this knowledge gap, we constructed structural brain networks from ADNI-GO/2 diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images with brain regions of interest (ROIs) as nodes and white matter connections as edges weighted by fiber density. The cohort consists of healthy control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and clinically diagnosed AD subjects. By optimizing consensus modularity of structural brain networks at a subpopulation level to investigate community structure throughout a range of resolution parameters (\u03b3), we observed a split of the reward-based decision-making module in the AD group at \u03b3 = 1.3, thus finding a 7th consensus community in the AD consensus brain network partition that was not present in that of MCI or HC populations. Upon further investigation, we found that thalamic and caudal regions were involved in the increased segregation of AD brain networks. These regions are implicated in regulation of decision-making processes, and their segregation from other decision-making regions is a novel finding in white matter biomarker studies of AD. Our study presents novel evidence that AD may be a disconnection syndrome at the mesoscopic structural level, with potential new avenues of exploration into the role of the thalamus and caudate that may reveal neural correlates of cognitive deficits in clinically diagnosed AD.",

Behavioral data are processed using a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN), demographic traits via a 1D CNN, and brain connectomes through a graph neural network equipped with a quadrant attention module that accentuates critical neural connections. The FAGNN model demonstrated a mean absolute error in age prediction of 31.85 days and a root mean squared error of 41.84 days, significantly outperforming simpler models. Our analysis further focused on the brain age delta, which assesses accelerated or delayed aging by comparing brain age, predicted by FAGNN, to the chronological age. A high-fat diet and the presence of the humanNOS2gene were identified as significant accelerators of brain aging in the old age group. Key neural connections identified by FAGNN, such as those between the cingulum, corpus callosum, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and piriform cortex, were found to be significant in the aging process. Validation using diffusion MRI-based metrics, including fractional anisotropy and return-to-origin probability measures across these connections, revealed significant age-related differences. These findings suggest that white matter degradation in the connections highlighted by FAGNN plays a key role in aging. Our findings suggest that the complex interplay of APOE genotype with sex, immunity, and environmental factors modulates brain aging and enhance our understanding of AD risk in mouse models of aging.",

        "AbstractText": "Music's role in modulating brain structure, particularly in neurodegenerative contexts such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), has been increasingly recognized. While previous studies have hinted at the potential neuroplastic benefits of musical engagement and training, the mechanisms through which music impacts structural connectivity in neurodegenerative pathways remain underexplored. We aimed to examine the impact of music perception skills, active musical engagement, and musical training on structural connectivity in areas relating to memory, emotion, and learning in individuals with worsening memory impairment, investigating the potential neuroplastic effects of music. Employing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based structural connectivity and graph theoretical analysis, we investigated brain topological features in 78 participants aged 42 to 85 with a range of memory impairments. Participants were assessed for musical training, engagement, and perception skills. The study analyzed regional and local network topological metrics to examine the influence of musical activities on graph metrics, while controlling for stages of objective memory impairment (SOMI) and diagnosis, separately. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of musical perception skills, active musical engagement, and musical training on structural connectivity within memory, emotion, and learning-related brain areas in individuals with varying degrees of memory impairment. We found enhanced structural connectivity of the right hippocampus and the right posterior cingulate cortex was associated with stronger local network metrics, such as clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality, with increased music perception skills like melody and beat perception. Musical training specifically impacted the clustering coefficient of the right hippocampus and the node degree of the right mid cingulate gyrus. Active musical engagement influenced the eigenvector centrality of the right hippocampus. Furthermore, musical training was associated with enhanced global metrics, such as global efficiency and characteristic path length. Our study integrates diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and graph theoretical analysis to reveal significant effects of musical activities on structural connectivity in key brain regions. The results highlight the potential of musical activities to serve as a non-invasive modulatory tool for cognitive resilience, especially in memory impairment and neurodegeneration contexts. These insights contribute to the understanding of delaying AD onset and aiding early-stage patients through music-based interventions, emphasizing the importance of musical engagement in maintaining cognitive and brain health.",

Here, we fit an unconstrained 2-poolquantitative MT (qMT) model, that is, without constraints on the longitudinalrelaxation rate  R 1 s   of semisolids, and investigate the sensitivity of the estimated parameters toamyloid accumulation in preclinical participants. We scanned 15 cognitivelynormal volunteers, of which 9 were amyloid positive by[18F]florbetaben PET.

Group comparisons andcorrelations with florbetaben PET standardized uptake value ratios were analyzedat the lobar level. We find that the exchange rate and semisolid pool's  R 1 s   were sensitive to the amyloid concentration, while morphometric measures ofcortical thickness derived from structural MRI were not. Changes in the exchangerate are consistent with previous reports in clinical AD, while changes in  R 1 s   have not been reported previously as its value is typically constrained in theliterature. Our results demonstrate that qMT MRI may be a promising surrogatemarker of amyloid beta without the need for contrast agents or radiotracers.",

However, [18F]PI-2620 signal in a large sample spanning the healthy aging and AD clinical spectrum as well as the stability of signal across different acquisition time windows has not yet been examined. Here, amyloid negative (A\u03b2-) cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 49), amyloid positive (A\u03b2+) CU (n = 37), CU individuals with unknown amyloid status (n = 5), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 14), dementia due to AD (n = 19), and non-AD neurodegenerative disorder (n = 54) participants were scanned with [18F]PI-2620 using a 45-75 min and/or 60-90 min acquisition time window. The impact of acquisition time on standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) magnitude was first quantified with linear mixed models, and in participants and regions with high [18F]PI-2620 signal, SUVRs increased linearly up to 0.04 SUVR with each additional 5 min past injection time. We then accounted for differences in acquisition time using a voxel-wise correction approach and showed high correlations (allr's \u2265 0.986) between SUVRs calculated from 45-75 min data and SUVRs from 60-90 min data that were interpolated to the 45-75 min scale in 15 participants who were scanned across both time windows. Using real and interpolated 45-75 min data, we next examined [18F]PI-2620 signal in Braak regions of interest and an off-target binding region (putamen) in A\u03b2- and A\u03b2+ CU, A\u03b2+ MCI, and A\u03b2+ AD dementia (n = 115) and showed that SUVRs in all Braak regions increased with greater disease severity. Within CU, higher Braak I SUVR was significantly associated with greater CSF pTau-181 (n = 35), and higher SUVRs were significantly associated with worse memory and language (n = 57). Thus, voxel-wise acquisition time corrections can be applied to combine [18F]PI-2620 datasets collected at different post-injection times, and once acquisition time is accounted for, [18F]PI-2620 signal shows the expected increases across the AD spectrum and can be used for detection of early tau elevations.",

        "AbstractText": "Longitudinal assessment of brain atrophy, particularly in the hippocampus, is a well-studied biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Estimating brain progression patterns can be applied to understanding the therapeutic effects of amyloid-clearing drugs in research and detecting the earliest sign of accelerated atrophy in clinical settings. However, most state-of-the-art measurements calculate changes directly by segmentation and/or deformable registration of MRI images, and may misreport head motion or MRI artifacts as neurodegeneration, impacting their accuracy. In our previous study, we developed a deep learning method DeepAtrophy that uses a convolutional neural network to quantify differences between longitudinal MRI scan pairs that are associated with time. DeepAtrophy has high accuracy in inferring temporal information from longitudinal MRI scans, such as temporal order or relative interscan interval. DeepAtrophy also provides an overall atrophy score that was shown to perform well as a potential biomarker of disease progression and treatment efficacy. However, DeepAtrophy is not interpretable, and it is unclear what changes in the MRI contribute to progression measurements. In this paper, we propose Regional Deep Atrophy (RDA), which combines the temporal inference approach from DeepAtrophy with a deformable registration neural network and attention mechanism that highlights regions in the MRI image where longitudinal changes are contributing to temporal inference. RDA has similar prediction accuracy as DeepAtrophy, but its additional interpretability makes it more acceptable for use in clinical settings, and may lead to more sensitive biomarkers for disease monitoring and progression understanding in preclinical AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Over the last few decades, diffusion MRI (dMRI) streamline tractography has emerged as the dominant method forin vivoestimation of white matter (WM) pathways in the brain. One key limitation to this technique is that modern tractography implementations require high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). However, HARDI can be difficult to collect clinically, limiting the reach of tractography analyses to research cohorts and thus limiting many WM investigations to certain populations and pathologies. As such, a clinically viable tractography solution applicable to wider patient populations scanned as a part of routine care would be of key significance in broadening WM analyses to underfunded or rarer diseases and to the clinical setting. Such a solution would require the ability to perform arbitrary tractography analyses, use only clinical imaging for input, and be open source and widely accessible and implementable. Thus, here we evaluate our recently developed, containerized, and open-source, T1-weighted (T1w) MRI-based deep learning model for streamline propagation. We empirically assess its performance against traditional dMRI-based and established atlas-based approaches in a healthy young population, an aging one, and in those with epilepsy, depression, and brain cancer. In the healthy young population, we find slightly increased error compared to traditional tractography with the deep learning model that falls within the bounds attributable to dMRI variability and is considerably less than the atlas-based approach. Further, seeking to replicate previously published dMRI tractography effects in the remaining cohorts as an initial assessment of clinical viability, we find this model successfully does so in some key cases-particularly in applications that rely on long-range streamlines including those not captured by the atlas-based approach-but importantly not all. These results suggest a deep learning-based approach to tractography with T1w MRI demonstrates promise within the limitations of our definition of clinical viability and especially over atlas-based approaches but requires refinement and more robust consideration of out-of-distribution effects prior to widespread clinical use. We also find these results raise additional questions regarding the differences in image content between dMRI and T1w MRI and their relationship to tractography. Further investigation of these questions will improve the field's understanding of which features of the brain influence measured tractography effects.",

MR images are often acquired to assist with processing of PET data, including for region-of-interest definitions in native space and for normalization to template space. However, in the real-world setting, corresponding MRIs may not be available and PET processing may require MRI-free pipelines. This is particularly important and challenging as the field moves towards early detection among clinically unimpaired (CU) individuals where changes in tau PET signal are expected to be subtle. We used two independent [18F]Flortaucipir tau PET datasets to evaluate whether MRI-free PET processing can detect subtle tau PET uptake differences in Amyloid+ (A+) CU individuals (preclinical AD) versus A-. Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVRs) from MRI-free compared to MRI-based methods were evaluated using linear regression and linear mixed-effects regression models. Effect size differences between A+/- CU groups in MRI-free processed cross-sectional and longitudinal tau PET SUVRs were compared to differences quantified through MRI-based processing. Regional MRI-free SUVRs were highly correlated with MRI-based SUVRs within CU individuals (average ICC = 0.90 for ADNI CU and 0.81 for A4 CU).

In longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) where structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is collected from individuals at multiple time points, participants may miss a study visit or drop out. Additionally, technical issues such as participant motion in the scanner may result in unusable imaging data at designated visits. Such missing data may hinder the development of high-quality imaging-based biomarkers. To address the problem of missing MRI data in studies of AD, we introduced a novel 3D diffusion model specifically designed for imputing missing structural MRI (Recovery of Missing Neuroimaging using Diffusion models (ReMiND)). The model generates a whole-brain image conditional on a single structural MRI observed at a past visit or conditional on one past and one future observed structural MRI relative to the missing observation. The performance of models was compared with two alternative imputation approaches: forward filling and image generation using variational autoencoders. Experimental results show that our method can generate 3D structural MRI with high similarity to ground-truth images at designated visits. Furthermore, images generated using ReMiND show relatively lower differences in volume estimation between the imputed and observed images compared to images generated by forward filling or autoencoders. Additionally, ReMiND provides more accurate estimated rates of atrophy over time in important anatomical brain regions than the two comparator methods. Our 3D diffusion model can impute missing structural MRI data at a single designated visit and outperforms alternative methods for imputing whole-brain images that are missing from longitudinal trajectories.",

Here, we investigate the short-term T-RT performance of dynamic[18F]MK-6240 outcomes in a group largely consisting of oCN. Wereport T-RT for uptake in potential reference regions, for extracerebraloff-target signal, and for estimates of tau burden and relative delivery indicesin tau-bearing target regions. Eight participants (7 oCN, 1 AD) underwentbaseline dynamic [18F]MK-6240 PET/MRI (Biograph mMR) and a retestfollow-up PET/MRI scan within approximately 3 weeks. T-RT was evaluated usingabsolute percentage differences and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) inthree groups of regions: (1) potential reference regions usingstandardized-uptake values 90-110 minutes post-injection(SUV90-110); (2) target regions using SUV ratios(SUVR90-110), distribution volume ratios (DVR), andrelative delivery (R1); and (3) extracerebral region usingSUVR90-110. A voxel-based partial volume correction (PVC)was applied. T-RT was evaluated with and without PVC. In oCN subjects, theSUV90-110T-RT in the evaluated reference regions rangedfrom 6 to 11% (ICC > 0.9); target region T-RT was similar forSUVR90-110(4-9%, ICC: 0.62-0.97), DVR(3-10%, ICC: 0.66-0.92), and R1(3-14%, ICC:0.52-0.97). PVC had minimal impact on reference regionSUV90-110T-RT, but increased target region T-RTvariability (SUVR90-110: 10-26%; DVR: 6-22%;R1: 4-20%). Extracerebral SUVR90-110exhibited higher T-RT variability (~12%, ICC: 0.85) than other target regions(average 6%) and increased to ~15% after PVC. Our findings are consistent withprevious reports and provide further evidence of acceptable[18F]MK-6240 T-RT in low-signal oCN subjects. Our results suggest[18F]MK-6240 is suitable for detecting early tau deposition andlongitudinal changes over time, and further support the viability of[18F]MK-6240 R1to evaluate longitudinal changes inperfusion. PVC increased T-RT variability in tau burden and R1outcomes. Notably, the extracerebral signal exhibited higher T-RT variabilitythan other target and reference regions and may affect their signal.",

        "AbstractText": "In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, episodic memory is commonly investigated with the subsequent memory paradigm in which brain activity is recorded during encoding and analyzed as a function of subsequent remembering and forgetting. Impaired episodic memory is common in individuals with or at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but only few studies have reported subsequent memory effects in AD or its risk states like mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One reason for this might be that subsequent memory responses may be blunted in AD or MCI and thus less likely to manifest in fMRI signal differences. Here, we used Bayesian model selection of single-subject fMRI general linear models (GLMs) for a visual novelty and memory encoding experiment to compare the model performance of categorical and parametric subsequent memory models as well as memory-invariant models in a clinical cohort (N = 468) comprising healthy controls (HC) as well as individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, and AD, plus healthy relatives of AD patients (AD-rel). We could replicate the previously reported superiority of parametric subsequent memory models over categorical models (Soch, Richter, Sch\u00fctze, Kizilirmak, Assmann, Knopf, et al., 2021) in the HC and also in the SCD and AD-rel groups. However, memory-invariant models outperformed any model assuming subsequent memory effects in the MCI and AD groups. In the AD group, we additionally found substantially lower model preference for models assuming novelty compared to models not differentiating between novel and familiar stimuli. Our results suggest that voxel-wise memory-related fMRI activity patterns in AD and also MCI should be interpreted with caution and point to the need for additional or alternative approaches to investigate memory function.",

Single-shell (SS) diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions are more common in clinical cohorts due to time constraints, but the FWE-DTI model is a two-compartment model, hence only well posed for multi-shell (MS) data. A regularised gradient descent (RGD) method is often applied to SS datasets and has been used to study healthy ageing, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, amongst others, largely ignoring the methodological limitations of this approach. In this study, we compared the performance of RGD fitting with SS data, to a non-linear least squares (NLS) fitting applied to MS data, using simulations and data from 620 participants aged 18 to 88 years. Consistent with previous studies, our simulations show that RGD fitting using SS data flattens the relationship between mean diffusivity (MD) estimates and their ground truth values, and introduces an artificial positive correlation between fractional anisotropy (FA) estimates and the underlying tissue ground truth MD. Neither of these biases were observed when NLS fitting was applied to MS data. In human data, a smaller number of significant voxels with positive correlations between MD and age were observed when the RGD SS algorithm was used, which is consistent with the flattening of MD profiles observed in simulations. FW-compensated FA maps produced strikingly different results depending on the method employed: the maps obtained with RGD SS identified some brain areas with a strong positive association with age, while no such positive correlations were found with MS NLS. While similar positive correlations between age and FW-compensated FA maps obtained with SS RGD have been reported, these results are only replicated when the RGD SS was used, suggesting that this apparent FA increase was likely an artefact introduced by inappropriate modelling using SS data. Our study, therefore, suggests that previous findings reported in the literature using the RGD approach should be interpreted with extreme care.",

Disruptions in these rhythms have been associated with health issues. Therefore, studying circadian rhythms is crucial for understanding physiology, behavior, and pathophysiology. However, it is challenging to study circadian rhythms over gene expression data, due to a scarcity of time labels. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the phases of untimed samples based on a deep neural network (DNN) architecture. This approach addresses two challenges: (1) prediction of sample phases and reliable identification of cyclic genes from high-dimensional expression data without relying on conserved circadian genes and (2) handling small sample-sized datasets. Our algorithm begins with initial gene screening to select candidate cyclic genes using a Minimum Distortion Embedding framework. This stage is then followed by greedy layer-wise pre-training of our DNN. Pre-training accomplishes two critical objectives: First, it initializes the hidden layers of our DNN model, enabling them to effectively capture features from the gene profiles with limited samples. Second, it provides suitable initial values for essential aspects of gene periodic oscillations. Subsequently, we fine-tune the pre-trained network to achieve precise sample phase predictions. Extensive experiments on both animal and human datasets show accurate and robust prediction of both sample phases and cyclic genes. Moreover, based on an Alzheimer's disease (AD) dataset, we identify a set of hub genes that show significant oscillations in cognitively normal subjects but had disruptions in AD, as well as their potential therapeutic targets.",

However, few extant data sources in the US possess these ideal features. A \"longitudinal synthetic cohort\"-a dataset created by stacking or linking multiple individual cohorts spanning different but overlapping periods of the life course-can overcome some of these challenges, leveraging the strengths of each component study. This type of synthetic cohort is especially useful for aging research; it enables description of the long-term natural history of disease and novel investigations of earlier-life factors and mechanisms shaping health outcomes that typically manifest in older age, such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review current understanding of synthetic cohorts for life course research. We first discuss chief advantages of longitudinal synthetic cohorts, focusing on their utility for aging/ADRD research to concretize the discussion. We then summarize the conditions needed for valid inference in a synthetic cohort, depending on research goals. We end by highlighting key challenges to creating longitudinal synthetic cohorts and conducting life course research within them. SUMMARY: The idea of combining multiple data sources to investigate research questions that are not feasible to answer using a single cohort is gaining popularity in epidemiology. The use of longitudinal synthetic cohorts in applied research-and especially in ADRD research-has been limited, however, likely due to methodologic complexity. In particular, little guidance and few examples exist for the creation of a longitudinal synthetic cohort for causal research goals. While building synthetic cohorts requires much thought and care, it offers tremendous opportunity to address novel and critical scientific questions that could not be examined in a single study.",

However, few of these approaches incorporate biological knowledge such as functional genomics and functional metabolomics. Graph-guided statistical learning methods that can incorporate knowledge of underlying networks have been shown to improve predication and classification accuracy, and yield more interpretable results. Moreover, these methods typically use graphs extracted from existing databases or rely on subject matter expertise which are known to be incomplete and may contain false edges. To address this gap, we propose a graph-guided Bayesian factor model that can account for network noise and identify globally shared, partially shared and modality-specific latent factors in multimodal data. Specifically, we use two sources of network information, including the noisy graph extracted from existing databases and the estimated graph from observed features in the dataset at hand, to inform the model for the true underlying network via a latent scale modeling framework. This model is coupled with the Bayesian factor analysis model with shrinkage priors to encourage feature-wise and modal-wise sparsity, thereby allowing feature selection and identification of factors of each type. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling. We demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing methods in simulations, and through analyses of gene expression and metabolomics datasets for Alzheimer's disease.",

However, the longitudinal hippocampal morphometric changes during the initial cognitive decline are unclear. Exploring a validated biomarker with high clinical relevance is urgent. This work proposed an automated MRI-driven longitudinal hippocampal alteration analysis system (LHAAS), which consists of hippocampal segmentation, reconstruction, registration, multivariate morphometric feature extraction, and longitudinal analysis of hippocampal morphometric and volumetric differences between groups. LHAAS was applied on two groups: cognitive unimpaired (CU) participants who maintained cognitive unimpaired (non-Progressors), and participants who converted to MCI during the following four years (Progressors). LHAAS can detect and visualize subtle deformations in the bilateral hippocampus of CU progressors four years before they show initial cognitive decline. For CU progressors, hippocampal atrophy initially occurs at the CA1 subregion and then along with disease progression, spreading to the CA2-3 and Subiculum subregion, exhibiting a left-greater-than-right trend. The volumetric analyses showed similar results. Besides, hippocampal subregions highly correlated with clinical measurement were identified by correlation analysis. LHAAS can accurately reflect the small hippocampal subregional atrophy at preclinical AD. This proposed system can track the longitudinal hippocampal alterations in the early stages of AD and provide insights for early intervention. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement: LHAAS offers early detection of subtle hippocampal alterations at preclinical AD.

        "AbstractText": "Physical exercise (PE) was proven crucial for cognitive health of both demented and cognitively intact individuals. Simultaneous cognitive training may augment PE beneficial effects in demented patients. However, it is still debatable how PE and/or cognitive training reflect on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and pathological factors related to Alzheimer's disease, namely inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 1 beta and 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), amyloid beta (\u0391\u03b2) peptides, total tau protein (t-tau) and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181). In the current study, 74 MCI patients were allocated to three groups: non-intervention (Control), PE, and PE with cognitive training (Mixed). Blood serum was received at the Baseline and after the intervention (at 3 months). Levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, \u0391\u03b242, \u0391\u03b240, tau and p-tau181 were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PE and Mixed interventions reduced the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and of p-tau181. Augmented levels of \u0391\u03b242 and the ratio \u0391\u03b242/40, and reduced ratio p-tau181/\u0391\u03b242 were verified only in the PE group. Reduced levels of TNF-\u03b1, \u0391\u03b240 and t-tau were verified only at the Mixed group. In addition, correlation analyses provided a significant interrelation between the alleviation of inflammation and p-tau181/\u0391\u03b242 reduction in patients of the Mixed intervention. These results suggest the beneficiary effect of PE and cognitive training on the regulation of inflammation resulting in mitigation of AD-related blood biomarkers and urge for their employment as non-pharmacological alternatives for stalling the progression of dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "Huperzine A (HupA) and huperzine B (HupB) are potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used widely for clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease, which are mainly extracrted from natural populations of Huperzia species. This study aimed to the evaluate potential of producing Hup of native Huperzia javanica species collected in Vietnam as well as identify endophytic fungi that produce high Hup or simultaneously produce many types of Hup derived from this plant as a material source for natural Hup production. By HPLC-DAD-MS analysis, H. javanica collected from Ha Giang, Vietnam was found as a novel producer of HupA and HupB with a yield of 0.513\u00a0mg/g dry weight (wt) and 0.192\u00a0mg/g dry wt, respectively. Inspired by this discovery, a total of 63 endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy tissues of the collected H. javanica plants, including 52 fungal strains belonging to nine genera and 11 unidentified strains based on morphological characteristics. Using HPLC, 9 Hup-producing fungi were identified when compared to the standard HupA and HupB. Surprisingly, 7 fungal strains produced both HupA and HupB, among which strain TLC12 produced the highest HupA and HupB contents of 0.271 and 0.163\u00a0mg/g mycelium dry cell weight (gdcw), respectively. Fungal strains TLC19 and TLC22 only yielded a respective amount of 0.305 and 0.135\u00a0mg/ gdcw of HupA. Combining with Internal Transcribed Spacer sequence analysis, 9 potent fungi were identified as Neurospora calospora (TLC9, TLC10, TLC11), Schizophyllum commune TLC12, Epicoccum sorghinum TLC13, Alternaria tenuissima TLC14, Cephalotrichum sp. TLC20, Daldinia sp. TLC19, and Schizophyllum sp. TLC22. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating H. javanica as a prolific and novel source of endophytic fungi capable of yielding high HupA and HupB contents. The exploitation of 9 Hup-producing fungi is also valuable for both basic research and industrial Hup manufactures. These findings open new perspectives for industrial production of fungal HupA and HupB and conservation of Huperzia species.",

        "AbstractText": "Neuroimage modalities acquired by longitudinal studies often provide complementary information regarding disease progression. For example, amyloid PET visualizes the build-up of amyloid plaques that appear in earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while structural MRIs depict brain atrophy appearing in the later stages of the disease. To accurately model multi-modal longitudinal data, we propose an interpretable self-supervised model called Self-Organized Multi-Modal Longitudinal Maps (SOM2LM). SOM2LM encodes each modality as a 2D self-organizing map (SOM) so that one dimension of each modality-specific SOMs corresponds to disease abnormality. The model also regularizes across modalities to depict their temporal order of capturing abnormality. When applied to longitudinal T1w MRIs and amyloid PET of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=741), SOM2LM generates interpretable latent spaces that characterize disease abnormality. When compared to state-of-art models, it achieves higher accuracy for the downstream tasks of cross-modality prediction of amyloid status from T1w-MRI and joint-modality prediction of individuals with mild cognitive impairment converting to AD using both MRI and amyloid PET.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with numerous risk factors, many of them attributed to exposure to harmful chemical substances at levels higher than recommended. The exposure can happen through sources like food, water and the environment. A significant number of the risk factors are modifiable, that is; their effects can be altered by minor modifications kept under consideration. This article describes four such modifiable risk factors- exposure to metals, high levels of the amino acid homocysteine in the plasma, exposure to pesticides and chronic consumption of alcohol. Heavy metals can enter our bodies through various sources like water, food (through the soil), and through sources like cigarette smoke. They can alter normal brain functioning and increase the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. High levels of plasma homocysteine can also be a risk factor, with various proposed potential mechanisms. Pesticide use may have some alarming consequences. The effects of many pesticides on increasing the chances for AD are proven by many studies, which also show that occupational exposure to them is a great risk. Another risk factor discussed is the heavy consumption of alcohol, which plays a role in altering the neurotransmitter release, which may lead to it being a risk factor for AD. The type of alcohol consumed also had varied effects. Some strategies to mitigate the risk of the modifiable risk factors have been discussed.",

The two most important proteins are extracellular amyloid \u03b2eta (A\u03b2) and intracellular hyperphosphorylated Tau that are contained in senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles respectively. AD accounts for cognitive impairment and progressive neuronal degeneration eventually, there is significant cerebral atrophy due to neuronal cell death. Initially, there is synaptic damage, synaptic loss plays a strong role in cognitive impairment in patients with AD. Also, evidence suggests that modifications in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus plays a role in AD. It has been investigated that synaptic pathology and defective neurogenesis in AD are related to progressive accumulation of A\u03b2 oligomers rather than fibrils. A\u03b2 oligomer formation occurs when the APP is cleaved off and subsequently A\u03b2 protein that is generated due to this cleavage is not cleared off by the ApoE mechanism.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the neurodegenerative diseases characterized by loss of integrity and function of the cell, leading to progressive neuronal loss and ultimately dementia. Tau is one of the most soluble protein mainly involved in assembly and disassembly of microtubules (MT) which helps in the anterograde and retrograde transport of cargos. However in AD conditions Tau is subjected to various insults such as hyperphosphorylation, glycation, glycosylation, truncation, acetylation, oxidation etc., which leads to the loss-of-function. Thus modified Tau loses its affinity for MT and aggregates to form toxic oligomers followed by matured neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which attains cross-\u03b2 structure. The cellular machinery such as chaperones, ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and lysosomes tries to resolve these aggregates and helps in its clearance. During AD pathology the cellular machinery fails to clear aggregates and leads to neuronal death. In this aspect several strategies have been employed to prevent Tau aggregation that includes inhibitors for kinases, activators for phosphatases, small molecule activators of heat shock protein response and small molecules that can prevent Tau aggregation and increases its association with chaperones.",

Lipid metabolism, which encompasses different lipid types such sphingolipids, cholesterol, fat-soluble vitamins, and fatty acids, is one of the key components of AD pathogenesis. These lipids are essential for many cellular functions, and the onset and course of AD are greatly influenced by their dysregulation. Sphingolipids, which include gangliosides, sulfatides, ceramides, and sphingomyelins, are essential for signal transduction, myelin sheath development, and the integrity of cell membranes. Sphingolipid metabolism is altered in AD, as seen by changes in ceramide levels and a reduction in sulfatides. These changes are associated with inflammation and neuronal death. Additionally, sphingomyelins and gangliosides are implicated; specific alterations in their concentrations have been reported in brains affected by AD, suggesting their participation in amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) pathology and neurodegeneration.",

Increasing evidence suggests that AD is a systemic disease closely associated with the immune system, not merely a central nervous system (CNS) disorder. Immune cells play crucial roles in the onset and progression of AD. Microglia and astrocytes are the primary inflammatory cells in the brain that can sensitively detect changes in the internal environment and transform into different phenotypes to exert differing effects at various stages of AD. Peripheral immune cells, such as T\u00a0cells, B\u00a0cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils can also be recruited to the CNS to mediate the inflammatory response in AD. As such, investigating the role of immune cells in AD is particularly important for elucidating its specific pathogenesis. This review primarily discusses the roles of central innate immune cells, peripheral immune cells, and the interactions between central and peripheral immune cells in the development of neuroinflammation in AD. Furthermore, we listed clinical trials targeting AD-associated neuroinflammation, which may represent a promising direction for developing effective treatments for AD in the future.",

Despite the lack of concrete information about the prevalence of dysphagia among AD patients, it still significantly impairs their quality of life (QoL). That outcome necessitates more investigations to understand the pathophysiology of this condition and how to manage it. In this study, we examined if AD-associated changes in pharyngeal and tongue muscles could explain dysphagia. METHODS: Fourteen adult male rats were allocated into 2 groups: Group I (control) received distilled water orally, group II (AD) received aluminum chloride (AlCl3) (200 mg/kg, per os) and D-galactose (60 mg/kg, subcutaneous) daily for 45 days. Biochemical parameters were conducted, including amyloid beta-peptide (A\u03b2), histopathological investigation of the hippocampus, tongue, and pharynx, and immune-histochemical expression of brain glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP). RESULTS: Our AD model showed marked cognitive impairment, hippocampal oxidative stress, and increased brain A\u03b2 expression (P=0.0003) compared to controls. Dysphagia was confirmed by loss of body weight (P=0.0077) and decreased eating and drinking patterns by 25%-35% in AD versus the control group. Histopathological, immune-histochemical, and biochemical evidence, including increased levels of pharyngeal A\u03b2 (P=0.0017), were detected in AD rats' tongue and pharyngeal muscles. CONCLUSION: Dysphagia in AD can result not only centrally but also due to local involvement of the tongue and pharynx. Further translational studies linking dysphagia to AD pathology will be needed.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is identified by the gradual decline in memory and cognitive function. It is classified by the deposition of A\u03b2 plaques, the build-up of intracellular neurofibrillary tangle (NFT), and neuron loss. Neurotrophic factors play a critical role in the treatment of AD. However, utilizing such neurotrophins has encountered certain difficulties and side effects. Novel technological advancements prioritize innovative dipeptide usage, which offers fewer side effects. METHODS: The present study endeavors to analyze the compound hexamethylenediamide bis-(N-monosuccinyl-glutamyl-lysine) (lab name: H-MGL), a newly discovered neurotrophin mimetic dipeptide, to alleviate memory impairment in an intracerebroventricular single dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced Alzheimer model in rats. We arranged 4 groups: Sham and groups receiving STZ and STZ + H-MGL (1 and 2 mg/kg). The H-MGL was administered consecutively for 14 days following the STZ injection. Then, the Morris water maze test was performed. RESULTS: The findings suggest that administration of STZ caused a significantly increment in mean escape latency and mean traveled distance in acquisition days. H-MGL at a 1 mg/kg dosage failed to yield any notable improvement in rats compared to STZ. By contrast, 2 mg/kg of H-MGL dosage led to a significant decrease in the latency to first platform crossing and frequency of platform crossings. CONCLUSION: Consequently, the findings above have engendered the notion that H-MGL partially ameliorates cognitive impairment, so it may hold promise for having low side effects to alleviate cognitive deficits in AD or potentially decrease the symptoms associated with its progression.",

Our previous study proved that Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd. aqueous extract (sweet tea aqueous extract, STAE) effectively inhibits hydrogen peroxide-induced neuronal cell injury. However, it is not clear whether STAE can protect against AD, and its underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the possible behavioral and neurochemical effects of STAE on A\u03b2 25-35-induced AD rats administered STAE (20, 40, 80\u2009mg/mL) for 14 days. We showed that STAE administration significantly and dose-dependently ameliorated the cognitive deficits in the AD rat models, assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, Y-maze test, and novel object recognition (NOR) test. The results of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Nissl staining showed that after treatment with STAE, the pathological damage to the hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons of rats was significantly improved. Furthermore, STAE dose-dependently inhibited microglia and astrocyte activation in the hippocampus of rats accompanied by increased protein expression of silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 6 (SIRT6) and decreased protein expression of nod-like receptor thermal protein domain-associated protein 3 (NLRP3) and its downstream pyroptosis-related genes after following A\u03b2 25-35.

Adults with Alzheimer disease have been shown to rely on emergency departments (EDs) as a source for care. This report describes ED visits by adults age 65 and older with Alzheimer disease according to selected patient and visit characteristics and compares them with visits by adults without Alzheimer disease. METHODS: Data in this report are from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a nationally representative annual survey of nonfederal general and short-stay hospitals. Results are presented by combining data for 2020, 2021, and 2022 for more detailed subgroup analyses. Estimates and their corresponding variances were calculated using SAS-callable SUDAAN software and were based on 3-year annual averages. Differences between rates and percentages were evaluated using two-sided significance\u00a0 t \u00a0tests at the 0.05 level. KEY FINDINGS: During 2020-2022, the annual ED visit rate by adults age 65 and older with Alzheimer's disease was 36.1 visits per 1,000 adults and increased with age. ED visit rates were highest among Black non-Hispanic people. Ambulance arrival was more frequent for ED visits by adults with Alzheimer's disease (61.0%) compared with visits by those without Alzheimer's disease (34.9%). About one-third (29.6%) of ED visits by adults with Alzheimer's disease were made by nursing home residents, higher than the corresponding percentage of visits by adults without Alzheimer's disease (5.9%). Approximately 37.2% of ED visits made by adults with Alzheimer's disease resulted in hospital admission, which was higher than the corresponding percentage of visits by those without Alzheimer's disease (28.6%).",

This need drives the demand for advanced statistical analytic approaches to handle challenges such as size, sparsity, and irregularity in 3D point clouds while ensuring accurate and efficient information extraction. This paper introduces a novel nonparametric distributed (NPD) learning framework that utilizes trivariate spline smoothing over a triangulation of domain. The proposed NPD algorithm features a straightforward, scalable, and communication-efficient implementation scheme that can achieve near-linear speedup. In addition, we provide rigorous theoretical support for the NPD estimation framework and demonstrate that the NPD spline estimators attain the same convergence rate as the global spline estimators obtained using the entire dataset and achieve the optimal nonparametric convergence rate established by Stone (1982) under some regularity conditions. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed NPD method, we conduct simulation studies comparing it with several global nonparametric estimation methods used to smooth the 3D data. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the NPD method in accurately and efficiently processing and learning from 3D point clouds, highlighting its potential to advance large and complex data analysis.

However, the application of TCM monomers is limited by their low solubility and poor ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) ranging in size from 30 to 150 nm in diameter and can be used as drug delivery carriers that directly target cells or tissues with unique advantages, including low toxicity, low immunogenicity, high stability in blood, and the ability to cross the BBB.

Existing treatments, including cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, do not reverse or slow the disease course but only treat its manifestations. This limitation has brought attention to the need for treatments that modify the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau pathology of the disease. One recent advancement in AD treatment is donanemab, a monoclonal antibody intended to clear A\u03b2 plaques in the brain. It targets pyroglutamyl(3)-A\u03b2 protein (3-42) to remove A\u03b2 deposits and alter the disease course. This review explores the timeline of donanemab use from discovery to clinical use. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the drug are discussed along with typical and suboptimal preclinical and clinical trial results in terms of efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Thus, donanemab is more effective than donepezil and rivastigmine in removing plaques and improving cognition. At the same time, it is not devoid of safety concerns that are typical of the majority of amyloid-targeted medicines. The control to end the treatment after plaque cleaning is a unique selling point for some patients, making it more attractive. The innovation and development of donanemab from research to clinical practice are a clear representation of the role of the field of translational medicine in the practical application of new knowledge in the treatment of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with characteristic biological markers. Clinically, AD presents as declines in memory, reasoning, and decision making, but the loss of memory is particularly associated with hippocampal damage. Likewise, excessive ethanol consumption has been found to disrupt hippocampal function and integrity. To assess the potential shared consequences of AD pathology and ethanol, 5xFAD mice were administered 5 g/kg ethanol daily for 10 days. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed ethanol and AD converged to lead to microglial and astrocytic senescence as well as increased A\u00df-plaque formation in the hippocampus. Despite the exacerbation of these potential mechanisms of neurodegeneration, there were no additive effects of ethanol exposure and AD-related genotype on Fluoro-Jade C (FJC)+ cells or cognitive deficits in the novel object recognition task. Overall, these results are the first to characterize the effects of ethanol exposure on early adulthood in the 5xFAD mouse model. Together these findings support the idea that alcohol can influence AD pathology; however, the mechanisms involved in AD progression (e.g., glial activation and A\u00df-plaque) may be impacted prior to evidence of pathology (e.g., cognitive decline or neuronal loss).",

The main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease that appear before the clinical symptoms are neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, brain inflammation, and neuronal atrophy throughout the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. GSK-3\u03b2 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3\u03b2) is regarded as the most important and promising target for therapeutic use because GSK-3\u03b2 expression levels increase with age and are the most abundant and hyperactive in the brains of patients with AD. GSK-3\u03b2 activation or upregulation can contribute to neurodegeneration by promoting amyloid beta (A\u03b2) production and tau hyperphosphorylation. Whereas the underlying mechanism for abnormal production of GSK-3\u03b2 in AD brains remains unclear. METHODS: Maestro was used, which is Schrodinger, for our computational simulation studies. In the present work, different modules that were used in previous studies with a little modification, the modules such as Protein Preparation with the help of Protein Preparation Wizard, Ligand Preparation with the help of LigPrep, for ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) prediction Qikprop was used, for docking studies Glide module was used, Binding energy prediction the Prime was used and Molecular dynamic simulation (MDs) studies done using Desmond.

Furthermore, only a few studies have examined naming error patterns in PPA. AIMS: In the current study, we examined the pattern of naming errors for nouns and verbs in all three subtypes of PPA, as well as unclassifiable PPA and typical (amnestic) Alzheimer's disease (AD). Statistical analyses focused on three common error types: phonological, semantic, and circumlocution errors. METHODS & PROCEDURES: The final sample included 35 participants with PPA and four participants with typical AD. Participants were asked to name 284 noun pictures and 116 verb pictures. Separately for nouns and verbs, repeated-measures ANCOVA was used to examine the interaction between Error Type and Diagnostic Subtype.Twenty of the participants also completed a structural MRI scan. For these participants, we examined the relationships between naming errors and brain volume within ten left hemisphere regions of interest (ROIs). OUTCOMES & RESULTS: In lvPPA, the proportion of phonological errors was significantly lower than the proportion of semantic errors for verbs. In svPPA, uPPA, and typical AD, semantic errors were significantly greater than phonological errors for both nouns and verbs. In between-subtype analyses, the proportion of semantic errors for nouns was significantly greater for participants with svPPA and uPPA, compared to those with nfvPPA.For nouns, the MRI analyses revealed significant negative correlations between the proportion of circumlocution errors and volume in the left inferior temporal gyrus and the left fusiform gyrus. For verbs, there were significant negative correlations between circumlocution errors and volume in the left insula, and between semantic errors and volume in the left superior temporal pole. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that semantic naming errors may be common for both nouns and verbs in typical AD and all subtypes of PPA, with the possible exception of nouns in nfvPPA. In contrast, phonological naming errors were not significantly more common than semantic errors in any diagnostic subtype. Furthermore, phonological naming errors were not significantly more common in lvPPA, compared to any other diagnostic subtype.",

        "AbstractText": "About 1 in 9 older adults over 65 has Alzheimer's disease (AD), many of whom also have multiple other chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, necessitating careful monitoring through laboratory tests. Understanding the patterns of laboratory tests in this population aids our understanding and management of these chronic conditions along with AD. In this study, we used an unimodal cosinor model to assess the seasonality of lab tests using electronic health record (EHR) data from 34,303 AD patients from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium. We observed significant seasonal fluctuations-higher in winter in lab tests such as glucose, neutrophils per 100 white blood cells (WBC), and WBC. Notably, certain leukocyte types like eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes are elevated during summer, likely reflecting seasonal respiratory diseases and allergens. Seasonality is more pronounced in older patients and varies by gender. Our findings suggest that recognizing these patterns and adjusting reference intervals for seasonality would allow healthcare providers to enhance diagnostic precision, tailor care, and potentially improve patient outcomes.",

In this study, we propose an innovative interpretable population graph network framework for identifying rapid progressors of AD by utilizing patient information from electronic health-related records in the UK Biobank. To achieve this, we first created a patient similarity graph, in which each AD patient is represented as a node; and an edge is established by patient clinical characteristics distance. We used graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict rapid progressors of AD and created a GNN Explainer with SHAP analysis for interpretability. The proposed model demonstrates superior predictive performance over the existing benchmark approaches. We also revealed several clinical features significantly associated with the prediction, which can be used to aid in effective interventions for the progression of AD patients.",

However, existing methods are not well-suited for identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a critical transitional stage between normal aging and AD. This inadequacy is primarily due to label imbalance and bias from different sensitve attributes in MCI classification. To overcome these challenges, we have designed an end-to-end fairness-aware approach for label-imbalanced classification, tailored specifically for neuroimaging data. This method, built on the recently developed FACIMS framework, integrates into STREAMLINE, an automated ML environment. We evaluated our approach against nine other ML algorithms and found that it achieves comparable balanced accuracy to other methods while prioritizing fairness in classifications with five different sensitive attributes.

METHODS: Network pharmacology and bioinformatics identified target pathways. An Alzheimer's disease model was induced in male wistar rats using A\u03b225-35, AlCl3, and RHTGF-\u03b21(referred to as compound A\u03b2). Memory impairment was confirmed with the Morris water maze. Modeled rats were assigned to a control group and three SSF-treated groups for 33 days. Passive avoidance learning abilities were assessed with a step-down test, and p-crebser133 expression in the hippocampus was detected via immunohistochemistry. Real-time qPCR and western blotting measured mRNA and protein levels of c-Raf, MEKs, Rsk, and zif268 in the hippocampus and cortex. RESULTS: Pathways such as the calcium signaling pathway, Apelin signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway were highlighted by KEGG analysis. The model had an 83.30% success rate. Model rats showed dry coats and unresponsiveness, while SSF treatment improved appearance and behavior. In passive avoidance tests, model rats made more errors and had shorter latencies (P < 0.01). They also showed decreased p-CREBSer133 and increased c-Raf, Rsk, and P-MEKs levels (P < 0.01), with reduced Zif268 (P < 0.01). SSF reversed these effects, enhancing p-CREBSer133 and Zif268 while regulating c-Raf, Rsk, and P-MEKs (P < 0.01).

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can lead to the expression of molecular chaperones in the ER, which helps in restoring cellular homeostasis. Researchers have highlighted the role of ER stress in the progression of AD, suggesting that regulating it could be a potential treatment strategy for AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We induced AD in mice by injecting amyloid beta-peptide 25-35 (A\u03b225-35) bilaterally into the CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus. Some mice were administered celastrol intraperitoneally before the A\u03b225-35 injection, while others received it after the injection. The mice underwent the Barnes maze cognitive test and Morris water maze test to assess learning and memory impairment. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and IL-10 were measured to evaluate inflammation, while total antioxidant capacity, catalase, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase levels were analyzed to estimate oxidative stress. RESULTS: Our study showed that pre-treatment with celastrol could prevent learning and memory decline in AD mice by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Celastrol also inhibited AD-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. Additionally, celastrol suppressed AD progression by targeting ER stress. These results suggest that celastrol treatment could be beneficial in addressing learning and memory deficits in AD, paving the way for potential neuroprotective treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Celastrol effectively improved learning and memory impairments in AD mice by targeting ER stress-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. This highlights the potential of celastrol as a therapeutic agent for AD.",

Initially affecting the hippocampus and entorhinal complex, which are responsible for memory, the disease later impacts the cerebral cortex, controlling language, logic, and social conduct. While the exact cause is unknown, genetic mutations and environmental factors are implicated. Diagnosis involves computed tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), Positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and lumbar punctures to detect brain abnormalities, protein deposits, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. AD features beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles that disrupt neuronal function, chronic inflammation, blood-brain barrier impairment, brain atrophy, and neuronal death. There is no cure; current treatments manage symptoms and slow cognitive decline. Research into genetic, cellular, and molecular pathways aims to develop targeted therapies. Tau tangle accumulation is closely linked to AD, making it crucial to explore therapies that restore normal tau pathways and prevent tau accumulation. Nanoparticulate drug delivery technologies offer promise in this area. This review discusses the potential of nanotechnology-based therapies to target AD-related tau accumulation and restore normal tau protein mechanics, which could preserve neuronal transmission, synaptic integrity, and brain tissue volume.",

The antioxidant ergothioneine (ERGO) is transferred to the brain after oral ingestion and protects against A\u03b2- induced neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction. However, the impact of ERGO on A\u03b2 oligomer-induced Tau phosphorylation remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of ERGO on A\u03b2-induced Tau phosphorylation and their mechanism in neurons. METHOD: SH-SY5Y cells differentiated into cholinergic neuron-like cells or primary cultured neurons derived from the murine hippocampus were pretreated with ERGO and exposed to A\u03b225-35 oligomers. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by assessing the chemiluminescence of dead cell-derived proteases. The expression of phosphorylated (p-) Tau at serine 396, p-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3\u03b2) at serine 9, amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1; \u03b2-secretase), and nicastrin, which is a component protein of the \u03b3-secretase complex, was assessed by western blotting. RESULT: Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exhibited increased neurite outgrowth and mRNA expression of choline acetyltransferase, and showed cholinergic neuron-like characteristics compared with those of undifferentiated cells. ERGO significantly suppressed the A\u03b225-35 oligomer-induced increased cytotoxicity and p-Tau expression in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and cultured hippocampal neurons. ERGO recovered the decreased expression of p-GSK-3\u03b2 at serine 9, indicating its inactivation, and the increased expression of APP, BACE1, and nicastrin induced by A\u03b225-35 oligomer exposure in cultured hippocampal neurons. These ERGO effects on A\u03b225-35 oligomers were inhibited by treatment with LY294002, which activated GSK-3\u03b2. CONCLUSION: ERGO may suppress the increased expression of p-Tau and proteins involved in A\u03b2 production induced by A\u03b2 oligomers by inactivating GSK-3\u03b2, thereby mitigating neurotoxicity.",

METHOD: A systematic review of literature from five databases was conducted. Ten original studies published between 2004 and 2020 were included and analyzed using an interpretive approach. FINDINGS: A conceptual interpretation emerged from the analysis, showing that social arenas and activities of daily life, as well as assumptions about dementia and natural aging made by the participants and society, influenced the participants' sense of identity.

The effects of APPswe and its intracellular and extracellular segments on the osteogenic differentiation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)-induced MSCs were analyzed in this study. Our analysis of an existing database revealed that APP was positively correlated with the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs but negatively correlated with their proliferation and migration. Furthermore, APPswe promoted BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, while APPswe-C (APPswe without an intracellular segment) had the opposite effect; thus, the intracellular domain of APPswe may be a key factor in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Additionally, both APPswe and APPswe-C inhibited the proliferation and migration of MSCs. Furthermore, the intracellular domain of APPswe inhibited the activity of the Notch pathway by regulating the expression of the Notch intracellular domain to promote the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Finally, APPswe-treated primary rat bone marrow MSCs exhibited the most favorable bone repair effect when a GelMA hydrogel loaded with BMP2 was used for in vivo experiments, while APPswe-C had the opposite effect. These findings demonstrate that APPswe promotes the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by regulating the Notch pathway, but its extracellular segment blocks the self-renewal, proliferation, and migration of MSCs, ultimately leading to a gradual decrease in the storage capacity of MSCs and affecting long-term bone formation.",

Understanding the sequence of preclinical biomarker changes provides a critical opportunity for early diagnosis and effective intervention prior to significant loss of patients' brain functions. The main challenge to early detection lies in the absence of direct observation of the disease state and the considerable variability in both biomarkers and disease dynamics among individuals. Recent research hypothesized the existence of subgroups with distinct biomarker patterns due to co-morbidities and degrees of brain resilience. Our ability to diagnose early and intervene during the preclinical stage of neurodegenerative diseases will be enhanced by further insights into heterogeneity in the biomarker-disease relationship. In this article, we focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and attempt to identify the systematic patterns within the heterogeneous AD biomarker-disease cascade. Specifically, we quantify the disease progression using a dynamic latent variable whose mixture distribution represents patient subgroups. Model estimation uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with the number of clusters determined by the Bayesian Information Criterion. We report simulation studies that investigate the performance of the proposed model in finite sample settings that are similar to our motivating application. We apply the proposed model to the Biomarkers of Cognitive Decline Among Normal Individuals data, a longitudinal study that was conducted over 2 decades among individuals who were initially cognitively normal. Our application yields evidence consistent with the hypothetical model of biomarker dynamics presented in Jack Jr et al. In addition, our analysis identified 2 subgroups with distinct disease-onset patterns. Finally, we develop a dynamic prediction approach to improve the precision of prognoses.",

How amyloid-\u03b2 deposition affects axon pathology has not been examined extensively. We used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining to analyze the forebrain tissue slices of Alzheimer's disease patients. Widespread axonal amyloidosis with distinctive axonal enlargement was observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. On average, amyloid-\u03b2-positive axon diameters in Alzheimer's disease brains were 1.72 times those of control brain axons. Furthermore, axonal amyloidosis was associated with microtubule-associated protein 2 reduction, tau phosphorylation, lysosome destabilization, and several blood-related markers, such as apolipoprotein E, alpha-hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin type A1C, and hemin. Lysosome destabilization in Alzheimer's disease was also clearly identified in the neuronal soma, where it was associated with the co-expression of amyloid-\u03b2, Cathepsin D, alpha-hemoglobin, actin alpha 2, and collagen type IV. This suggests that exogenous hemorrhagic protein intake influences neural lysosome stability. Additionally, the data showed that amyloid-\u03b2-containing lysosomes were 2.23 times larger than control lysosomes. Furthermore, under rare conditions, axonal breakages were observed, which likely resulted in Wallerian degeneration. In summary, axonal enlargement associated with amyloidosis, micro-bleeding, and lysosome destabilization is a major defect in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, exosomes have garnered extensive attention as therapeutic agents and early diagnostic markers in neurodegenerative disease research. Exosomes are small and can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing them to target deep brain lesions. Recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes derived from different cell types may exert therapeutic effects by regulating the expression of various inflammatory cytokines, mRNAs, and disease-related proteins, thereby halting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and exhibiting beneficial effects. However, exosomes are composed of lipid bilayer membranes and lack the ability to recognize specific target cells. This limitation can lead to side effects and toxicity when they interact with non-specific cells. Growing evidence suggests that surface-modified exosomes have enhanced targeting capabilities and can be used as targeted drug-delivery vehicles that show promising results in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of existing research aimed at devising approaches to modify exosomes and elucidating their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings indicate that exosomes can efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier to facilitate drug delivery and can also serve as early diagnostic markers for neurodegenerative diseases. We introduce the strategies being used to enhance exosome targeting, including genetic engineering, chemical modifications (both covalent, such as click chemistry and metabolic engineering, and non-covalent, such as polyvalent electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, ligand-receptor binding, aptamer-based modifications, and the incorporation of CP05-anchored peptides), and nanomaterial modifications. Research into these strategies has confirmed that exosomes have significant therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases. However, several challenges remain in the clinical application of exosomes. Improvements are needed in preparation, characterization, and optimization methods, as well as in reducing the adverse reactions associated with their use.

Alzheimer's disease is one of the leading causes of neurodegeneration characterized by the aggregation of Tau and Amyloid-\u03b2 proteins intracellularly and extracellularly, respectively. The intracellular aggregation of Tau triggers accumulation of oxidative stress, loss of ER and mitochondrial function, leading to the aggravation of aggregates formation. Thus, increasing the load of aberrant proteins on chaperones and degradative mechanism, such as autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system. Although several small molecules are known to target and prevent Tau aggregation, the detrimental effects in the cell due to aggregates accumulation shall not be overlooked. In such instance, small molecules that effectively target Tau aggregates and the cellular aberrations would be of great importance. Here we have discussed the efficacy of natural molecule, Limonoid, isolated from Azadirachta indica that prevents Tau aggregation and also activates the heat shock protein system.

This paper highlights the role of psychological stress as a critical yet underappreciated risk factor for cognitive decline and reviews its complex interplay with behavioral, social, and biological mechanisms. Chronic psychological stress drives physiological and behavioral changes that are linked to accelerated cognitive deterioration, particularly in older adults. Early interventions can target stress management and behavioral prevention strategies, which include physical activity, healthy diet, and social engagement. Further, key barriers to meaningful policy change to prevent and slow ADRD include lack of public awareness, stigma around mental health and aging, and misaligned funding incentives. Policy initiatives can improve brain health literacy, increase equitable access to services, and enhance community-level and environmental factors to promote healthy aging.

While various commercial medications exist for delivering oligonucleotides to the hepatic tissue, achieving effective delivery to extra hepatic tissues remains a formidable challenge. Here, we review recent advances in oligonucleotide technologies, including nanoparticle delivery, local administration, and 2'-O-hexadecyl (C16)-conjugation that work to extend the applicability of siRNAs and ASOs to nerve tissues. We discuss critical factors pivotal for the successful clinical translations of these modified or engineered oligonucleotides in the context of treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the accumulation of two different proteins, \u03b2-amyloid and tau. The objective of the present study was to examine the impact of bilateral administration of the cannabinoid receptor antagonist (AM251) in the hippocampus on spatial memory and tau gene expression in an Alzheimer's disease model. The \u03b2-amyloid toxin was administered bilaterally into the hippocampus of Wistar male rats to induce Alzheimer's disease. The rats were then divided into four groups: the control group (which received distilled water as a solvent for \u03b2-amyloid toxin), the lesion group (which received the \u03b2-amyloid), \u03b2-amyloid + DMSO group (as antagonist solvent), and the AM251 antagonist receiving groups. During the training course of the Morris water maze test, the antagonist of the cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist AM251 was administered bilaterally into the hippocampus for four consecutive days at doses of 5, 25, and 100 ng. To evaluate the spatial memory of the animals, the following parameters were analyzed: distance traveled, latency time to reach the hidden platform, velocity of the animals, and tau gene expression in real time. The spatial memory indices were found to be impaired following the injection of \u03b2-amyloid and the AM251 cannabinoid antagonist. Following the injection of \u03b2-amyloid toxin, there was an increase in mRNA expression of tau protein. However, no significant difference was observed between the cannabinoid antagonist and \u03b2-amyloid groups. These results indicate that \u03b2-amyloid toxin has a destructive effect on spatial memory and that cannabinoid system plays a positive role in memory formation and consolidation, However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, and no effective treatment has been developed for it thus far. Recently, the use of natural compounds in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases has garnered significant attention owing to their minimal adverse reactions. Accordingly, the potential therapeutic effect of pterostilbene (PTS) on AD has been demonstrated in multiple in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro experiments. In this study, we systematically reviewed and summarized the results of these studies investigating the use of PTS for treating AD. Analysis of the literature revealed that PTS may play a role in AD treatment through various mechanisms, including anti-oxidative damage, anti-neuroinflammation, anti-apoptosis, cholinesterase activity inhibition, attenuation of \u03b2-amyloid deposition, and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, PTS interferes with the progression of AD by regulating the activities of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-\u03b1), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), silent information regulator sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A). Furthermore, to further elucidate the potential therapeutic mechanisms of PTS in AD, we employed network pharmacology and molecular docking technology to perform molecular docking of related proteins, and the obtained binding energies ranged from\u00a0-2.83 to\u00a0-5.14\u00a0kJ/mol, indicating that these proteins exhibit good binding ability with PTS. Network pharmacology analysis revealed multiple potential mechanisms of action for PTS in AD. In summary, by systematically collating and summarizing the relevant studies on the role of PTS in treatment of AD, it is anticipated that this will serve as a reference for the precise targeted prevention and treatment of AD, either using PTS or other developed drug interventions.",

        "AbstractText": "Neuronal death is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA becomes damaged when processes such as replication, repair, and nucleotide synthesis are compromised. This extensive accumulation of damaged mitochondrial DNA subsequently disrupts the normal function of mitochondria, leading to aging, degeneration, or even death of neurons. Mitochondrial dysfunction stands as a pivotal factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recognizing the intricate nature of their pathogenesis, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutic interventions. In recent years, mitochondrial DNA editing tools such as zinc finger nucleases, double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A-derived cytosine base editors, and transcription activator-like effector ligand deaminases have emerged. Their emergence will revolutionize the research and treatment of mitochondrial diseases. In this review, we summarize the advancements in mitochondrial base editing technology and anticipate its utilization in neurodegenerative diseases, offering insights that may inform preventive strategies and therapeutic interventions for disease phenotypes.",

METHOD: Parents of children 0-8 years of age from across the United States (N = 286; 85% White; 56% women) were recruited through Prolific to participate in an online survey. RESULTS: Although 90% of parents agreed with a definition of spanking that included the word \"hitting\" and 33% used the term \"hitting\" in their definitions of spanking, parents also rated spanking as less severe than hitting. The percentage of participants who agreed that it is acceptable for parents to hit children (30%) was significantly higher than the percentage that reported it was acceptable to hit other family members (dog, 17%; wife, 1%; parent with Alzheimer's, 0%; Tukey tests, p < .001). Nearly a third of parents reported that completing the survey had changed their beliefs about spanking. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that American parents hold inconsistent beliefs about hitting children, including a judgment that it is more acceptable to hit a child than to hit a dog. These results exemplify the need for systemic parent education and policy interventions to bring children's human rights to live free from family violence in line with the recognized rights of adults.",

Here, we have investigated whether quinic- and chlorogenic-acid-derived Carbon Quantum Dots (QACQDs and ChACQDs, respectively) protect against a (pesticide) paraquat-insult model of PD. Our results indicated that both types of CQDs intervened in the soluble-to-toxic transformation of the amyloid-forming model protein Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL). Furthermore, QACQDs and ChACQDs demonstrated antioxidant activity while remaining biocompatible in a human neuroblastoma-derived cell line (SH-SY5Y) up to 5 mg/ml and protected the cell line from the environmental neurotoxicant (paraquat). Importantly, both CQDs were found to protect dopaminergic neuronal ablation in a paraquat model of Parkinson's disease using the nematode C. elegans. Our results are significant because both plant-derived organic acids cross the blood-brain barrier, making them attractive for developing CQD architectures. Furthermore, since the synthesis of these CQDs was performed using green chemistry methods from precursor acids that cross the BBB, these engineered bionanomaterial platforms are tantalizing candidates for preventing neurodegenerative disorders associated with exposure to environmental neurotoxicants.",

Single-cell technologies facilitate gene expression measurement for individual cells and cell-type identification, yet the connection between TF-TF coordination and target gene (TG) regulation of various cell types remains unclear. RESULTS: To address this, we introduce our innovative computational approach, Network Regression Embeddings (NetREm), to reveal cell-type TF-TF coordination activities for TG regulation. NetREm leverages network-constrained regularization, using prior knowledge of PPIs among TFs, to analyze single-cell gene expression data, uncovering cell-type coordinating TFs and identifying revolutionary TF-TG candidate regulatory network links. NetREm's performance is validated using simulation studies and benchmarked across several datasets in humans, mice, yeast. Further, we showcase NetREm's ability to prioritize valid novel human TF-TF coordination links in 9 peripheral blood mononuclear and 42 immune cell sub-types. We apply NetREm to examine cell-type networks in central and peripheral nerve systems (e.g. neuronal, glial, Schwann cells) and in Alzheimer's disease versus Controls. Top predictions are validated with experimental data from rat, mouse, and human models. Additional functional genomics data helps link genetic variants to our TF-TG regulatory and TF-TF coordination networks. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/SaniyaKhullar/NetREm.",

METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted, including unpaid caregivers of patients with dementia who were receiving home care in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The prevalence of loneliness was estimated using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Participants were also assessed regarding their satisfaction with providing care and whether they felt they received the necessary emotional support from family and friends. The association between loneliness and the patient's clinical variables, as well as the sociodemographic characteristics of the caregiver, was evaluated by calculating the odds ratio (OR) between the groups. RESULTS: A total of 52 caregivers of patients with dementia were included. Severe loneliness was present in 5.77% of caregivers, while 26.92% experienced moderate loneliness. All caregivers reported feeling satisfied with providing care to their relatives, and 71% felt that their family or friends provided the emotional support they required. Loneliness was more common among caregivers of patients with total functional dependence (OR: 4.061, p= 0.0278). Conversely, the perception of receiving emotional support from family and friends was identified as a potential protective factor against loneliness (OR: 0.184, p= 0.0104). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of loneliness in this study is lower than that reported in previous studies. All caregivers reported satisfaction in providing care; most perceived adequate emotional support from family and friends.

Despite the considerable endeavors devoted to discovering treatments for NDs in recent decades, the demand for efficient therapeutic agents persists. Sertoli cells (SCs) play a crucial role in providing a supportive structure and environment for the development of germ cells. SCs, whether transplanted as xenogeneic or allogeneic cells, present a viable choice for enhancing graft persistence via the release of immunomodulatory and trophic factors, including neurturin\u00a0(NTN), platelet-derived growth factor, Fas (CD95) ligand (FasL), glial-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin 1 (IL1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin 6 (IL6), transforming growth factors, and vascular growth factor, that protect replaced cells and tissues from the immune system. However, there is currently no cohesive evidence regarding the neuroprotective influence of the transplantation of SCs on NDs. Therefore, this review focuses on assessing stem cells' neuroprotective impact on neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical settings and presenting cohesive information. A comprehensive search was conducted between 2000 and 2022. In the identification stage, after a comprehensive search across databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed/Medline, 103 papers were obtained. The search conducted in the present study yielded a total of nine relevant papers on the therapeutic effect of the transplantation of SCs on NDs. It was found that the transplantation of SCs exhibits a promising impact on enhancing the symptoms of neurological diseases in rats. The findings highlight the need for multiple standardized pre-clinical trials to find reliable information to confirm the utilization of the transplantation of SCs and the reduction of the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive dementia, is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical trial results of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau regulators based on the pretext of straightforward amyloid and tau immunotherapy were disappointing. There are currently no effective strategies for slowing the progression of AD. Herein, we spotlight the dysregulation of lipid metabolism, particularly the elevation of ceramides (Cers), as a critical yet underexplored facet of AD pathogenesis. Our study delineates the role of Cers in promoting microglial pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis and necroptosis, characterized by cellular swelling, and membrane rupture mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Utilizing both in\u00a0vivo experiments with amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mice and in\u00a0vitro assays with BV-2 microglial cells, we investigate the activation of microglial pyroptosis by Cers and its inhibition by icariin (ICA), a flavonoid with known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Our findings reveal a significant increase in Cers levels and pyroptosis markers (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, caspase-1, gasdermin D (gasdermin D (GSDMD)), and interleukin-18 (IL-18)) in the brains of AD model mice, indicating a direct involvement of Cers in AD pathology through the induction of microglial pyroptosis. Conversely, ICA treatment effectively reduces these pyroptotic markers and Cer levels, thereby attenuating microglial pyroptosis and suggesting a novel therapeutic mechanism of action against AD. This study not only advances our understanding of the pathogenic role of Cers in AD but also introduces ICA as a promising candidate for AD therapy, capable of mitigating neuroinflammation and pyroptosis through the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-NLRP3 inflammasome-gasdermin D (GSDMD) axis. Our results pave the way for further exploration of Cer metabolism disorders in neurodegenerative diseases and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial pyroptosis in AD.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated the effects of remotely supervised tDCS in managing NPS in older adults with mild to moderate ADRD. Forty older adults diagnosed with early-stage ADRD were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive home-based active tDCS (n = 20) or sham tDCS (n = 20). RESULTS: Results showed a significantly greater improvement in the following NPS: scratching (P = 0.052, Hedges' g = -0.60 [confidence interval {CI}: -1.24, 0.04], Cliff's \u03b4 = -0.41 [CI: -0.67, -0.06]), nighttime behaviors (P = 0.041; Hedges' g = -0.62 [CI: -1.26, 0.03]; Cliff's \u03b4 = -0.41 [CI: -0.67, -0.06], and appetite/eating changes (P = 0.010; Hedges' g = -0.78 [CI: -1.43, -0.13]; Cliff's \u03b4 = -0.41 [CI: - 0.56, -0.10]).

        "AbstractText": "Neurotransmitters are essential in regulating the functions of the nervous, cardiovascular, endocrine, and various other tissue systems. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, depression, and Alzheimer's disease involve the loss of catecholamine neurons. One of the main challenges is the accumulation of catecholamine (CA) metabolites. Reducing the metabolic aggregation toxicity of the transmitter molecules remains an open question. In this work, we proposed a novel physical method, terahertz-triggered dedocking, to unbind ligand molecules that accumulate around receptor proteins, potentially alleviating neurodegenerative diseases. We found that electromagnetic stimulation at 44.5 THz successfully dissociates the DA ligand from the binding sites at the receptor by breaking weak hydrogen bonds. Using molecular docking, we identified multiple binding sites for CA neurotransmitter molecules within the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2). We also characterized the terahertz fingerprints and theoretical spectra of CAs across the 0.5 to 50 THz range, revealing their microscopic vibrational modes at characteristic peak positions and elucidating how specific vibrations influence molecular conformational changes. This finding highlights the potential of terahertz radiation in regulating the nervous system and provides new theoretical support for neural drug discovery and the intervention of neurological disorders.",

Emerging observational evidence suggests that left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) may reduce the risk of dementia in patients with AF; however, further research is required to confirm this potential benefit. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of LAAO vs direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in reducing the risk of dementia in patients with AF. METHODS: We conducted target trial emulation using data from the TriNetX research network. Patients with AF were allocated to 2 cohorts (2270 patients in each one), treated either with LAAO or with DOACs, and balanced with propensity score matching. The primary end points were composite dementia, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer disease. Secondary end points included mortality, ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and major adverse cardiovascular events. Follow-up was conducted over 3 years. RESULTS: At 3-year follow-up, the risk of composite dementia was lower in the LAAO group than in the DOAC group (hazard ratio 0.57; 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.85). Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent results, favoring the LAAO group. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of secondary outcomes.

Higher perceived social disability scores were associated with greater brain activation in the left angular gyrus in response to sad emotional faces across all participants but did not correlate with responses to overall negative (sad, angry, and fearful) or positive (happy) emotional faces. No interaction effect of diagnosis was observed for the finding. Perceived loneliness scores did not correlate with brain activation to emotional faces.

METHODS: A publicly available EEG database was utilized, with seven EEG recordings selected from each study group (MCI, AD, and C) to ensure a balanced dataset. For each 1-s segment of EEG data, 43 time-frequency features were computed. These features were then compressed over time using 10 statistical measures. Subsequently, 15 classifiers were employed to distinguish between paired groups using a 7-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: The strategy yielded better results than state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 100% accuracy in both C versus MCI and C versus AD binary classifications. This improvement translated to a 2% increase in accuracy for C versus MCI and a 4% increase for C versus AD, despite a 1.2% decrease in performance for AD versus MCI.

To this end, various medical technologies and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), ranging from biosensors and raw signals to medical imaging, have been used to provide information about the state of AD. In this survey, we aim to provide a review on CAD systems for automated AD detection, focusing on different data types: namely, signals and sensors, medical imaging, and electronic medical records (EMR). METHODS: We explored the literature on automated AD detection from 2022-2023. Specifically, we focused on various data resources and reviewed several preprocessing and learning methodologies applied to each data type, as well as evaluation metrics for model performance evaluation. Further, we focused on challenges, future perspectives, and recommendations regarding automated AD diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared to other modalities, medical imaging was the most common data type. The prominent modality was Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In contrast, studies based on EMR data type were marginal because EMR is mostly used for AD prediction rather than detection. Several challenges were identified: data scarcity and bias, imbalanced datasets, missing information, anonymization, lack of standardization, and explainability. CONCLUSION: Despite recent developments in automated AD detection, improving the trustworthiness and performance of these models, and combining different data types will improve usability and reliability of CAD tools for early AD detection in the clinical practice.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To identify notable research contributions relevant to digital health applications for precision prevention published in 2023. METHODS: An extensive search was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles published in 2023 that examined ways that informatics approaches and digital health applications could facilitate precision prevention. The selection process comprised three steps: 1) candidate best papers were first selected by the two section editors; 2) a diverse, international group of external informatics subject matter experts reviewed each candidate best paper; and 3) the final selection of four best papers was conducted by the editorial committee of the Yearbook. The section editors attempted to balance selection by authors' global region and areas with clinical medicine and public health. RESULTS: Selected best papers represent studies that advanced knowledge surrounding the use of digital health applications to facilitate precision prevention. In general, papers identified in the search fell into one of the following categories: 1) applications in precision nutrition; 2) applications in precision medicine; and 3) applications in precision public health. The best papers spanned several disease targets, including Alzheimer's disease, HIV, and COVID-19. Several candidate papers sought to improve prediction of disease onset, whereas others focused on predicting response to interventions. CONCLUSION: Although the selected papers are notable, significant work is needed to realize the full potential for precision prevention using digital health. Current data and applications only scratch the surface of the potential that information technologies can bring to support primary and secondary prevention in support of health and well-being for all populations globally.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with neurogenic fiber tangles caused by amyloid-\u03b2 protein plaques and tau protein hyperphosphorylation as the pathological manifestations. This study was based on multi-omics to investigate the mechanisms and immune characterization of AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on bulk RNA-seq (GSE122063 and GSE97760), we screened potential biomarkers for AD by differential expression analysis and machine learning algorithms. Then, we analyzed the expression characteristics and immune functions of the above biomarkers by scRNA-seq (single-cell RNA sequencing) data analysis (GSM4996463 and GSM4996462) and immune infiltration analysis. RESULTS: Five biomarkers (RBM3, GOLGA8A, ALS2, FSD2, and LOC100287628) were identified using machine learning algorithms. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of these biomarkers in astrocytes from AD samples compared to normal samples. Additionally, three key biomarkers were selected based on interaction networks, and the diagnostic models indicated high diagnostic efficacy for these biomarkers. Based on immune infiltration and correlation analyses, RBM3, GOLGA8A, and ALS2 were all highly correlated with CD8 T cell content in the immune microenvironment of AD. CONCLUSIONS: The biomarkers identified in this study demonstrate significant diagnostic potential for AD. Notably, the downregulation of RBM3 in astrocytes and the decreased presence of CD8 T cells infiltrating brain tissue are potential risk factors for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "As of 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the average life expectancy for both sexes in the United States is 77.5 years. While new advances in health have increased life expectancy, aging comes with complications that impact the development of diseases like cancer, senile dementia (non-Alzheimer), diabetes and Parkinson's. Through aging, the body's immune system declines, a process recognized as immunosenescence and which contributes to inflammaging, a state of chronic, though non-productive, inflammation that progresses with advancing age in the absence of overt infection and that contributes to the onset and progression of a spectrum of age-related pathologies. MicroRNAs are small forms of RNA that control gene expression by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cell cytoplasm. In particular, microRNA-941 (miR-941) has been found to play a critical role in the regulation of differentiation of cell populations, certain T cell subsets responsible for maintaining efficient immune surveillance in normal subjects, immune compromised individuals as well as the elderly. We propose that concerted research designed to define and characterize interventions targeting the regulatory effects of miRNA-941 specifically on T-cell subsets will benefit treatment of infectious (e.g., CoViD-19, H5N1 infection) and chronic illnesses (e.g., diabetes II, diabetes III, Long Covid [i.e., Post-Acute Covid-19 Syndrome, PACS], autoimmune disease), which are most common among the aging and the immune compromised population. It is possible and even probable that active research in this specific area will proffer new horizons for finding cures, aid in disease management and improved accessibility and affordability of public health services.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Multi-target anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) compounds are promising leads for the development of AD modifying agents. Ionic compounds containing quaternary ammonium moiety were synthesized, and their multi-targeted anti-AD effects were examined. METHODS: Imidazole derivatives containing a quaternary ammonium moiety were synthesized and evaluated for their potential anti-Alzheimer properties using computational (in silico), cellular (in vitro), and animal (in vivo) models. The inhibition kinetics of both human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE) were assessed. Neuroprotective effects in amyloid-beta (A\u03b2)-exposed PC12 cells were also examined. Furthermore, the compounds' impact on A\u03b2-induced memory impairment in Wistar rats was evaluated, with a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Compound 5g demonstrated acceptable cytotoxicity against human cells. This compound exhibited non-competitive dual inhibition of both hAChE and hBuChE. Additionally, compound 5g mitigated the morphological changes induced by amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) in PC12 cells and decreased cell mortality. It exhibited anti-oxidative stress properties, evident by reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The compound also down regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory genes IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. In vitro studies validated compound 5g's ability to inhibit lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), attenuate neuroinflammation, and prevent the autophagy-apoptosis cascade. When administered to rats with A\u03b2-induced memory dysfunction, compound 5g enhanced cognitive function and improved spatial memory. In the hippocampi of treated rats, there was a noted downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and NF-kB. Furthermore, compound 5g counteracted the elevated activity of AChE. Molecular modeling validated the binding of compound 5g to both steric and catalytic sites of cholinesterase enzymes. CONCLUSION: The novel quaternary ammonium derivative, compound 5g, demonstrated multi-target anti-AD properties, as evidenced by in silico, in vitro and in vivo studies. Behavioral assessments and molecular analyses further confirmed its therapeutic efficacy in amyloid-beta (A\u03b2)-challenged rats.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Cognitive And Neuroprotective Effects of Vernonia amygdalina in scopolamine-induced Memory impaired Rats.",
        "AbstractText": "Cognitive impairment is largely associated with functional and structural loss in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) models, and scopolamine has been successfully used to mimic these deficits in rodents. The cost and side effects of drugs presently used for the treatment of AD-related cognitive impairment have prompted research into alternative products, especially natural ones with high antioxidant capacity, since oxidative stress is a major pathophysiology associated with AD. The current study evaluated the cognitive and neuroprotective effects of Vernonia amygdalina (VA) on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in rats. Thirty-five male rats, randomly divided into seven groups (n = 5), were used. Group 1 served as the control and received distilled water. Groups 2 and 3 received Vernonia amygdalina, VA (50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively) per orally (p.o.). Group 4 received 1 mg/kg scopolamine SC (i.p.). Groups 5, 6, and 7 received pretreatment with either VA 50 mg/kg, VA 100 mg/kg, or Donepezil, DP (1 mg/kg), and then in combination with SC (1 mg/kg). The animals were subjected to memory tasks using the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition tasks (NORT) and sacrificed on day 14, after which their brains were isolated for biochemical and histological studies. The study showed that during MWM and NORT, spatial and non-spatial recognition memories, which were respectively impaired in the SC group compared to the control group, were reversed in the VA pretreatment groups. Scopolamine injection caused significant decreases in superoxide dismutase and catalase levels and an increase in malonaldehyde (MDA) levels in group 4 compared with the control group. Pretreatments with either VA or DP, however, caused a significant increase in the SOD and catalase levels and a decrease in the MDA level compared with the SC group. Histological studies revealed that VA was more potent in protecting the brain against SC-induced neurodegeneration and morphological alterations in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Findings of this study suggest that VA attenuates scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits via inhibition of oxidative stress and neuronal degeneration and enhancement of cognition in the brains of rats.",

Conventional drugs for managing AD do not address associated non-neurocognitive co-morbidities, hence the need to investigate alternative therapies especially from plants. The neuroprotective benefits of bromelain have been identified, but its impacts on scopolamine-induced neurotoxicity is yet to be elucidated. Twenty-Five male rats were separated randomly into 5 groups: Control (normal saline; 1ml/kg); Scopolamine (i.p; 1mg/kg); Bromelain (50mg/kg); Scopolamine + Bromelain; Scopolamine + Donepezil (reference drug, 1mg/kg). Neurobehavioral paradigms (novel object recognition, elevated plus maze, forced swimming and open field tests were assessed, followed by biochemical (MDA, SOD, AChE, NO, Total protein & IL-1b) assay in the PFC. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (Tukey's posthoc.). Values with p<0.05 were considered significant. Scopolamine reduced memory index (P<0.01) (cognitive function), ambulatory & rearing activities (P<0.05) (motor behavior), open arm duration (P<0.001) (anxiety-like behavior) & increased immobility time (P<0.05) (depressive-like behavior). Exposure to scopolamine also led to significant reduction in the prefrontal cortical levels of SOD (P<0.05) while increasing MDA (P<0.05), acetylcholinesterase (P<0.01) and IL-1\u03b2 (P<0.05). However, levels of NO and total protein were not significantly altered. In contrast, intervention with bromelain or donepezil significantly reversed most of the behavioral and biochemical alterations induced by scopolamine. Bromelain compared favorably with donepezil in improving memory decline and other non-cognitive dysfunctions associated with scopolamine exposure. This could have resulted from modulation of oxidative stress, inflammation and cholinergic transmission.

        "AbstractText": "Rita Levi-Montalcini's 1953 discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF) in mouse sarcoma tumors marked a groundbreaking moment in neuroscience. NGF, a key signaling molecule, became the first identified neurotrophic factor, influencing the growth, differentiation, and survival of neurons in both peripheral and central nervous systems. NGF and related neurotrophic factors hold therapeutic potential for various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, neuropathies, traumatic brain injuries, and stroke. However, despite promising in vitro studies and animal models findings, NGF efficacy in patients remains unproven. Indeed, its use as a therapeutic agent faces challenges in delivery and clinical translation. This review delves into these challenges, exploring ongoing research on refined delivery methods, dosages, and safety profiles. Innovative strategies, including molecular mimicking, combination therapies, gene therapy, and coupling with neuromodulation techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation, are discussed. Incorporating nerve growth factor (NGF) into a comprehensive strategy may prove beneficial, particularly in non-neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke, trauma, and neuropathies. In these instances, NGF holds promise for promoting tissue regeneration and repair.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder disease mainly caused by extracellular senile plaques (SP) formed by \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b21-42) protein deposits. Copper (Cu) is an essential metal involved in neural system, and its homeostasis is the key to maintain its proper function. Herein, the subcellular locations of Cu(I) and Cu(II) in human neurodegenerative disease SH-SY5Y cells and AD mouse brains were imaged. We found that the content of Cu(II) decreased while that of Cu(I) increased under A\u03b2 exposure, which were further verified in the brain tissues of the AD mouse model, strongly suggesting the disruption of Cu homeostasis under A\u03b2 exposure or AD. Remarkably, the mitochondrial and lysosomal Cu(II) decreased significantly, whereas Cu(I) decreased in mitochondria but increased in lysosome. Lysosomes digested the damaged mitochondria via mitophagy to remove excess Cu(I) and maintain Cu homeostasis. The A\u03b2 induced Cu(I) in mitochondria resulted in an overformation of reactive oxygen species and altered the morphology of this organelle. Due to the oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH) was converted into glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and Cu(I) bound with GSH was further released into the cytoplasm and absorbed by the lysosome. Transcriptomic analysis showed that genes (ATP7A/B) related to Cu transportation were upregulated, whereas genes related to mitochondrial complex were down-regulated, representing the damage of this organelle. This study demonstrated that A\u03b2 exposure caused the disruption of intracellular homeostasis by reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and damaging the mitochondria, which further triggered detoxification by the lysosome. Our finding provided new insights in A\u03b2 and AD induced Cu redox transformation and toxicity.",

PARTICIPANTS: One thousand eighteen participants were recruited. Of these, 962 participants (mean age 75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07, 59% female, 1720 undilated eyes) had any OCT angiography (OCTA) data. METHODS: Participants from the community-based FHS were recruited between 2020 and 2022. Foveal-centered 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 mm2 OCTA scans were used to noninvasively measure retinal capillary perfusion in both undilated eyes of each subject. Retinal capillary perfusion measures, including vessel skeleton density (VSD), vessel area density (VAD), and flux, were calculated in the superficial retinal layer, deep retinal layer (DRL), and full retinal thickness. Multivariate mixed-effect models were used to examine the association between retinal perfusion measures and eye laterality, sex, image quality, axial length (AL), and age. Correlation of retinal perfusion measures between 2 eyes of individual participants was assessed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vessel skeleton density, VAD, and flux. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred forty-four eyes (73%) had usable OCTA data with 52% acquired from the right eye. Although there was a significant correlation of retinal perfusion measures between 2 eyes of an individual, this was only moderate in magnitude (R\u00a0=\u00a00.6, P\u00a0<\u00a00.000). There was also a significant decrease in retinal perfusion with age (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) after controlling for sex, image quality, eye laterality, and AL. A potential interaction between age and layer-specific retinal perfusion was found (P\u00a0=\u00a00.058). Similar findings were observed with all measures of retinal perfusion (VAD, VSD, and flux). Projection artifact removal accounted for 9% to 34% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.050) of the variation in capillary perfusion measures in the DRL. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal capillary perfusion measures between 2 eyes of an individual share only moderate correlation even after adjusting for image quality and scan level artifacts. This has important implications in study design and interpretation of data from unilaterally performed studies on the retinal circulation. These data suggest that intereye differences in retinal perfusion have physiological and disease-related causes that warrant further investigation.

We explore the use of a novel deep learning tool to assess the functional impact of genetic mutations in UM. DESIGN: A cross-sectional bioinformatics exploratory data analysis of genetic mutations from UM cases. SUBJECTS: Genetic data from patients diagnosed with UM were analyzed, explicitly focusing on missense mutations sourced from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. METHODS: We identified missense mutations frequently observed in UM using the COSMIC database, assessed their potential pathogenicity using AlphaMissense, and visualized mutations using AlphaFold. Clinical significance was cross-validated with entries in the ClinVar database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were the agreement rates between AlphaMissense predictions and ClinVar annotations regarding the pathogenicity of mutations in critical genes associated with UM, such as GNAQ, GNA11, SF3B1, EIF1AX, and BAP1. RESULTS: Missense substitutions comprised 91.35% (n\u00a0=\u00a01310) of mutations in UM found on COSMIC. Of the 151 unique missense mutations analyzed in the most frequently mutated genes, only 40.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a061) had corresponding data in ClinVar. Notably, AlphaMissense provided definitive classifications for 27.2% (n\u00a0=\u00a041) of the mutations, which were labeled as \"unknown significance\" in ClinVar, underscoring its potential to offer more clarity in ambiguous cases. When excluding these mutations of uncertain significance, AlphaMissense showed perfect agreement (100%) with ClinVar across all analyzed genes, demonstrating no discrepancies where a mutation predicted as \"pathogenic\" was classified as \"benign\" or vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating deep learning through AlphaMissense offers a promising approach to understanding the mutational landscape of UM. Our methodology holds the potential to improve genomic diagnostics and inform the development of personalized treatment strategies for UM.

Aging is a significant driver of these alterations, and dementia is a major cause of disability and mortality. Despite extensive clinical trials over the past two decades, no effective drug has been developed to improve AD symptoms or slow its progression, indicating the inefficiency of current treatment targets. In AD development, the molecular microenvironment plays a significant role. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a key component of this microenvironment, regulate post-transcriptional gene expression, and are expressed more abundantly in the brain than in other tissues. Several dysregulated miRNAs in AD have been linked to neuropathological changes, such as plaque and tangle accrual, as well as altered expression of notorious molecules. Preclinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of phytochemicals/food bioactive compounds (PCs/FBCs) in regulating miRNA expression, which makes them immensely beneficial for targeting miRNA-altered expression patterns in neuronal diseases. This review highlights the potential of miRNAs in driving AD pathology and its development. Furthermore, it discusses the therapeutic efficacy of PCs/FBCs and their miRNA-regulatory properties, especially focusing on antiinflammatory and antioxidant capacities for their development as effective AD agents.",

Integrated and effective analysis of multiple data sources is often beyond the scope of traditional diagnostic procedures. With the use of multi-modal data, recent developments in neural network approaches present encouraging opportunities for raising diagnostic accuracy. OBJECTIVES: A novel approach has been proposed toward the integration of different Nondestructive Evaluation data with EEG signals for improving the diagnosis of neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia, by leveraging advanced neural network techniques in order to improve the identification and correlation of shared latent features across heterogeneous NDE datasets. METHODS: We determined the 2D scalogram images using a specific encoder-decoder neural network after transforming the EEG signals using wavelet signal processing. Several NDE data types can be easily integrated for thorough analysis due to this network's ability to extract and correlate important aspects from each form of data. Aiming to uncover common patterns indicating of neurological disorders, the technique was evaluated on datasets containing EEG signals and corresponding NDE data. RESULTS: Our method demonstrated a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. The encoder-decoder network effectively identified shared latent features across the heterogeneous NDE datasets, leading to more precise and reliable diagnoses. The fusion of multi-modality NDE data with EEG signals provided a robust framework for the automatic identification of multiple neurological disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This innovative approach represents a substantial advancement in the field of neurological disorder diagnosis. By integrating diverse NDE data with EEG signals through advanced neural network techniques, we have developed a method that enhances the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing multiple neurological conditions.

This study examined whether a separate and systematic evaluation of perfusion MRI (pMRI) could impact such treatment decisions in the early stage. METHODS: This retrospective observational study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy for detecting early tumor progression of 4 different approaches including conventional MRI, pMRI with Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), and/or Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) MRI, and compared those to the MDTM evaluation in clinical practice. RESULTS: Sixty-five glioblastoma patients with clinical and radiological data until 9 months after irradiation were included. For all approaches, the sensitivity for detecting early true disease progression was poor to moderate (32%-62%). Area under the curve values were comparable (range 0.63-0.74), but highest for the MDTM evaluation (0.74). In the cases of inconclusive MDTM (26%), systematic pMRI evaluation showed a higher sensitivity compared to conventional MRI (respectively, 36% vs 0%), while the specificity was 100% for all MRI approaches. Multivariable regression analysis showed that a lower KPS score (OR = 0.84 [95% CI: 0.77-0.91]) and pMRI indicative of tumor progression (OR = 0.09 [95% CI: 0.02-0.52]) were independently associated with concluding tumor progression at the MDTM. CONCLUSION: MDTM assessment in daily clinical practice has a higher diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing early tumor progression from pseudoprogression compared to a separate, systematic evaluation of pMRI.

RESULTS: 199 participants (66\u00a0% male) were included (98-MPH, 101-placebo). Among all participants, worsening CF was associated with worsening apathy (-0.15 (0.05), p\u00a0=\u00a0.003). In addition, change in HVLT-I was associated with the interaction between changes in apathy and treatment (-0.31 (0.07), p\u00a0=\u00a00.0000158). CONCLUSION: Changes in apathy are mostly independent of cognitive changes and apathy response to MPH may be independent from cognition. These results are consistent with the view that apathy as a syndrome is related to but distinct from cognition.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the predictive utility of proactive semantic interference (PSI) and failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) deficits on the longitudinal everyday functional decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) among older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective cohort study. SETTING: 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (1FLADRC). PARTICIPANTS: 97 older adults aged 54 to 98 years who were diagnosed with aMCI following a baseline evaluation. The average age was 71.9 years, 51\u00a0% male, average education 15.7 years, and 56\u00a0% Hispanic. The mean MMSE score was 28.0. Participants were followed annually for 3 to 4 visits with a mean follow-up time of 38.9 months (range 22.7 to 70.3 months). MEASUREMENTS: CDR-SOB were obtained at each visit and the latent growth curve trajectory of CDR-SOB was estimated. The associations between PSI and frPSI and the growth curve trajectory of CDR-SOB were examined. RESULTS: The growth curve model that best fits the CDR-SOB trajectory was a linear form and included the fixed and random effect of intercept and slope of time. After adjusting for age, sex, education, Hispanic background, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) immediate and delayed recall, and amyloid positivity, frPSI (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.134, se=0.04, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) remained statistically significant in predicting a steeper slope on the trajectory of decline in CDR-SOB. CONCLUSIONS: frPSI at baseline predicted the rate of everyday functional decline over time among participants with aMCI regardless of amyloid status and demonstrated its utility of longitudinal prediction of change in CDR-SOB.",

DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study. SETTING: Memory clinic, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0162) who agreed to take part in the Cortisol and Stress in AD (Co-STAR) study during 2014-2017 and had data available for variables of interest. MEASUREMENTS: Participants rated their depressive symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and collected diurnal salivary cortisol samples at home. Cognitive performance was assessed by standardized cognitive tests in the following domains: memory, working memory, processing speed, perceptual reasoning, and general cognitive function. Dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) were diagnosed as part of the clinical work-up. We determined the associations between GDS and cognitive domain scores using linear regressions, including cortisol levels as covariates. We also tested if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers amyloid \u03b242 (A\u03b242) and tau proteins modified these associations. RESULTS: The GDS score was negatively associated with performance in working memory and processing speed, independently of cortisol levels. These associations were no longer significant after introducing AD biomarkers as covariates. Baseline GDS score was not associated with change in memory or processing speed at follow-up.

The study sought to examine whether younger onset age of OSA is associated with a higher risk of incident dementia. METHODS: This cohort study, based on the UK Biobank's prospective population data, excluded 445,023 participants due to baseline dementia diagnoses, incomplete covariate information, or pre-OSA onset dementia over a 12.6-year median follow-up. The research applied Cox regression and propensity score matching to explore the relationship between sleep apnea onset age and later development of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's, and vascular dementia. RESULTS: In a controlled study contrasting those without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), those suffering from OSA showed markedly higher risks for developing all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD), with hazard ratios (HR) of 4.243 (95% CI: 3.678-4.897), 5.668 (95% CI: 4.380-7.336), and 6.064 (95% CI: 4.008-9.175) respectively. Following adjustment with propensity score matching, OSA patients younger than 52 presented the highest risk of all-cause dementia, with an adjusted HR of 2.256 (95% CI: 1.901-3.747). This trend was consistent for early-onset AD and VD in the same age group. CONCLUSION: Younger age at OSA onset was associated with increased risk of dementia. Individuals with an onset age of OSA before 52 years of age may represent a particularly vulnerable population for dementia irrespective of subtypes and need careful monitoring and timely intervention to attenuate subsequent risk of incident dementia.",

Genetic screening is celebrated as a significant advancement for its early detection capabilities, pinpointing those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. Yet, the limited availability of these technologies highlights a critical gap in widespread application. This review pivots to the potential of presymptomatic clinical assessments as a readily available, economical, and simple strategy for early detection. Traditionally, AD diagnosis relies on the late-stage identification of cognitive deterioration, functional impairments, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, coinciding with advanced brain degeneration. Conversely, emerging research identifies early indicators preceding significant degeneration, manifesting years before clinical symptoms. We introduce a mnemonic, MEMORIES, to categorize these prodromal: Metabolism changes, Eye/visual impairments, March (refer to gait disturbances), Olfactory dysfunction, Rhythm (blood pressure and heart rate), Insensitivity of the tongue, Ears (hearing loss), and Stool alterations. Recognizing these prodromal through clinical examinations provides a valuable strategy for initiating preventative actions against brain degeneration. This approach advocates for broadening the screening lens beyond genetic screening to encompass clinical evaluations, enhancing early detection and intervention opportunities for AD.",

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage before AD, urgently needs the development of prediction models for conversion from MCI to AD. METHOD: This study used machine learning methods to predict whether MCI subjects would develop AD, highlighting the importance of biomarkers (biological indicators from neuroimaging, such as MRI and PET scans, and molecular assays from cerebrospinal fluid or blood) and non-biomarker features in AD research and clinical practice. These indicators aid in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and the development of potential treatments for MCI subjects. Using baseline data, which includes measurements of different biomarkers, we predicted disease progression at the patient's last visit. The Shapley value explanation (SHAP) technique was used to identify key features for predicting patient progression. RESULTS: The study used the ADNI database to evaluate the effectiveness of eight classification methods for predicting progression from MCI to AD. Four fundamental data sampling approaches were compared to balance the dataset and reduce overfitting. The SHAP technique improved the ability to identify biomarkers and non-biomarker features, enhancing the prediction of disease progression. NEAR-MISS was found to be the most advantageous sampling method, while XGBoost was found to be the superior classification method, offering enhanced accuracy and predictive power. CONCLUSION: The proposed SHAP for feature selection combined with XGBoost may provide improved predictive accuracy in diagnosing Alzheimer's patients.",

It primarily defends the central nervous system against injury from acute and progressive neurodegenerative disorders. Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the body's natural defense mechanisms and the generation of reactive oxygen species, is crucial in developing neurological disorders. Due to its high metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, the brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. Excessive ROS damages the essential biomolecules, leading to cellular malfunction and neurodegeneration. Several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and ischemic stroke, are associated with oxidative stress. Understanding the impact of oxidative stress in these conditions is crucial for developing new treatment methods. Researchers are exploring using antioxidants and other molecules to mitigate oxidative stress, aiming to prevent or slow down the progression of brain diseases.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major form of dementia in the elderly and is closely related to the toxic effects of microglia sustained activation. In AD, sustained microglial activation triggers impaired synaptic pruning, neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity, and cognitive deficits. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that aberrant expression of deubiquitinating enzymes is associated with regulating microglia function. Here, we use RNA sequencing to identify a deubiquitinase YOD1 as a regulator of microglial function and AD pathology. Further study showed that YOD1 knockout significantly improved the migration, phagocytosis, and inflammatory response of microglia, thereby improving the cognitive impairment of AD model mice. Through LC-MS/MS analysis combined with Co-IP, we found that Myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), a key regulator maintaining microglia homeostasis, is an interacting protein of YOD1. Mechanistically, YOD1 binds to MYH9 and maintains its stability by removing the K48 ubiquitin chain from MYH9, thereby mediating the microglia polarization signaling pathway to mediate microglia homeostasis. Taken together, our study reveals a specific role of microglial YOD1 in mediating microglia homeostasis and AD pathology, which provides a potential strategy for targeting microglia to treat AD.",

Synergistic effects of the A\u03b2-Tau cascade reaction are tightly implicated in AD pathology, and microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation drives neuronal tauopathy. However, the underlying mechanism of how A\u03b2 mediates NLRP3 inflammasome remains unclear. Herein, we determined that oligomeric A\u03b2 (o-A\u03b2) bound to microglial Kv2.1 and promoted Kv2.1-dependent potassium efflux to activate NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in neuronal tauopathy by using Kv2.1 inhibitor drofenine (Dfe) as a probe.

METHODS: A comprehensive search on PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), and Scopus was conducted to find the relevant original studies. Language, sex, age, date, or country of study were not restricted. Included studies report increased Alzheimer's disease mortality and hospital admission. RESULTS: This increase was seen from the first day with high temperature to 3-4 days later. Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects were more vulnerable to high temperatures compared to dementia patients (RR for dementia: 1.29 and for PD: 1.41). Global warming was linked to the increase in the incidence of Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) (from 0.1% to 5.4%), Japanese encephalitis (OR: 2 when floods occur), and ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) (RR: 1.62 for each 1 \u25e6C increase per month).

        "AbstractText": "The thalamus and its constituent nuclei are critical for a broad range of cognitive, linguistic, and sensorimotor processes, and are implicated in many neurological and neurodegenerative conditions. However, the functional involvement and specificity of thalamic nuclei in human neuroimaging work is underappreciated and not well studied due, in part, to technical challenges of accurately identifying and segmenting nuclei. This challenge is further exacerbated by a lack of common nomenclature for comparing segmentation methods. Here, we use data from healthy young (Human Connectome Project, n = 100) and older healthy adults, plus those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, n = 540), to benchmark four state-of-the-art thalamic segmentation methods for T1 MRI (FreeSurfer, histogram-based polynomial synthesis [HIPS]-THOMAS, synthesized contrast segmentation [SCS]-convolutional neural network [CNN], and T1-THOMAS) under a single segmentation framework. Segmentations were compared using overlap and dissimilarity metrics to the Morel stereotaxic atlas, a widely accepted thalamic atlas. We also quantified each method's estimation of thalamic nuclear degeneration across Alzheimer's disease progression, and how accurately early and late mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease could be distinguished from healthy controls. We show that the HIPS-THOMAS approach produced the most effective segmentations of individual thalamic nuclei relative to the Morel atlas, and was also most accurate in discriminating healthy controls from those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease using individual nucleus volumes. This latter result was different when using whole thalamus volumes, where the SCS-CNN approach was the most accurate in classifying healthy controls. This work is the first to systematically compare the efficacy of anatomical thalamic segmentation approaches under a unified nomenclature. We also provide recommendations of which segmentation method to use for studying the functional relevance of specific thalamic nuclei, based on their overlap and dissimilarity with the Morel atlas.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to affect the lengths and frequencies of certain kinds of pauses in speech. Previous studies have used features based on pause lengths for AD classification. We conjecture that in addition to using pause lengths, it is beneficial to incorporate the \"context\" behind each pause, i.e., what is being said before and after each pause. We propose an AD detection method based on this idea. As part of the proposed method, pause lengths and context are extracted from the raw audio using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and forced alignment. Then, statistical summaries of pause lengths with context information are extracted from the transcripts and used as features for classification. Our results indicate that incorporating the context significantly improves classification performance compared to using pause lengths alone, with classification accuracy of up to 81%. Additionally, the proposed features largely preserve privacy.",

More comprehensive neuroimaging studies are needed to elucidate the links between these sensory functions and neural circuit alterations. In this study, we used a subset of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) S1200 data containing both the neuroimaging and sensory test data (n = 50). Using high-order Group Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in combination with Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA), we studied the interplay between odor and taste sensory measures and spatiotemporal features of the resting-state networks. The findings revealed that a decline in olfaction was associated with decreased connectivity within the posterior default mode network, central executive network, and dorsal attention network. Similarly, a lower capacity for taste detection was linked to changes in the connectivity within the dorsal attention network. Conversely, enhanced taste detection was correlated with increased connectivity in the thalamus. We also found that olfaction was associated with the connectivity between the olfactory network and a cognitive network, which includes the inferior frontal orbital gyrus and Rolandic operculum. Taste, on the other hand, was associated with functional connectivity between the central executive network and the cerebellar network. Our study brings new insights into the relationship between olfaction, taste, and various resting-state networks.",

Along-tract statistical analysis of microstructural metrics can reveal the effects of neurological and psychiatric diseases with 3D spatial precision. To maximize statistical power to detect disease effects and factors that influence them, data from multiple sites and scanners must often be combined, yet scanning protocols and hardware may vary widely. For simple scalar metrics, data harmonization methods - such as ComBat and its variants -allow modeling of disease effects on derived brain metrics, while adjusting for effects of scanning site or protocol. Here, we extend this method to pointwise segment analyses of 3D fiber bundles by integrating ComBat into the BUndle ANalytics (BUAN) tractometry pipeline. In a study of the effects of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) on 38 white matter tracts, we merge data from 7 different scanning protocols used in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, which vary in voxel size and angular resolution. By incorporating ComBat harmonization, we model site- and scanner-specific effects, ensuring the reliability and comparability of results by mitigating confounding variables. We also evaluate choices that arise in extending batch adjustment to tracts, such as the regions used to estimate the correction. We also compare the approach to the simpler approach of modeling the site as a random effect.

AD is a health issue that is attracting attention as the world's populations get older. Although there is currently no effective treatment for this disease, early diagnosis is necessary to help people prevent it. Here, we developed an MRI-based deep learning and multi-class AD classification and prediction framework. Based on the traditional Visual Geometry Group 19 (VGG19) architecture, we embedded the Convolutional Block Attention Module Attention layer to build an Alzheimer's directional prediction 3D convolution model referred to as AD_Net in this paper. We used MRI images from the ADNI open data resource to train, classify, and predict three different conditions: AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN). Experimental results showed that the prediction accuracy and system robustness of AD_Net are superior to those of basic VGG19. To improve the accuracy of the prediction, we developed a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based model to incorporate additional factors into the model, such as age, gender, and Mini-Mental State Examination score. We presented the model performance for groups with and without directional influence factors. Accuracy for the two groups was 51.2% and 89%, respectively.

However, current deep model research on the morphological analysis of hippocampus is mainly based on 2D MRI slices, lacking a comprehensive description of the 3D surface morphology and complex textures of the hippocampus. For this reason, we propose a two-stream multi features deep learning model that establishes a descriptive system for 3D spatial structure and morphological atrophy features on the triangular mesh of left and right hippocampus. First, we encode the triangular mesh data into the spatial structural features of the hippocampal surface. Second, considering the tubular structure of the hippocampus and the inhomogeneous morphological changes caused by AD, we introduce the thickness features and Heat Kernel Signature (HKS) features for the morphological atrophy features encoding. Third, we integrate the encoded features of adjacent faces from a macroscopic perspective into the discriminative morphological features induced by AD. Finally, driven by classification tasks, the deep learning model parameters and the discriminative features are continuously optimized, thereby improving the accuracy of AD diagnosis. Our method is evaluated based on the T 1 weighted sMRI baseline data of 269 A\u03b2+ AD and 437 A\u03b2-normal cognitively(NC) subjects collected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

The underlying breakthrough generative mechanism of denoising diffusion modeling can generate high quality synthetic images and can learn the underlying distribution of complex, high-dimensional data. In our paper, we train conditional latent diffusion models (LDM) and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) to provide insight into Alzheimer's disease (AD) effects on the brain's anatomy at the individual level. We first created diffusion models that could generate synthetic MRIs, by training them on real 3D T1-weighted MRI scans, and conditioning the generative process on the clinical diagnosis as a context variable. We conducted experiments to overcome limitations in training dataset size, compute time and memory resources by testing different models, effects of pretraining, training duration. We tested the sampling quality of the disease-conditioned diffusion using metrics to assess realism and diversity of the generated synthetic MRIs. We also evaluated the ability of diffusion models to conditionally sample MRI brains using a 3D CNN-based disease classifier relative to real MRIs. In our experiments, the diffusion models generated synthetic data that helped to train an AD classifier (using only 500 real MRI scans) - and boosted its performance by over 3% when tested on real MRI scans. Further, we used classifier-free guidance to alter the conditioning of an encoded individual scan to its counterfactual (representing a healthy subject of the same age and sex) while preserving subject-specific image details. From this counterfactual image (where the same person appears healthy), a personalized disease map was generated to identify possible disease effects on the brain.

Henceforth, we developed the proposed methodology, utilizing DenseNet-121 on polar-transformed and zone-selected fundus images, which significantly enhances AD and MCI classification, achieving 83% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, 77% specificity, 87% precision, and an F-1 score of 88%. Moreover, the model's Grad-Cam++ heatmap highlights vasculature differences, particularly in tortuosity and thickness, between AD and MCI fundus images. Combined with our previous work, we created a fully automated pipeline model for MCI, AD, and Normal aging classification, which is inexpensive, fast, and non-invasive with an overall 3-class accuracy of 88%.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Ranking the Importance of Spatiotemporal Windows of EEG Signals Results in a Better Alzheimer's Disease Prediction.",
        "AbstractText": "The integration of Electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements with machine learning holds the promise of enhancing diagnostic accuracy and providing personalized insights into the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in particular. The complex nature of EEG signals, influenced by individual variability and noise, poses difficulties in interpreting the rich and dynamic embedded information, thus requiring algorithms capable of discerning meaningful patterns. In this work, we develop a novel approach for ranking the importance of spatiotemporal EEG information based on the Smart Aggregation Framework (SAF) framework in which each spatiotemporal window is weighted non-linearly using the Boltzmann distribution with a hyperparameter, analogous to temperature. We validate our model on a dataset that includes EEG recordings of 65 healthy and AD subjects. We rank the significant spatiotemporal windows for each subject and show that the features of the top-ranked windows provide significant separability between the AD and healthy subjects. We determine the most significant electrode and show that taking only the top two electrodes provides a better classification of the AD patients compared with taking all the electrodes or a random pair. Besides providing cutting-edge accuracy in classifying AD, our work provides an interpretability framework for ranking spatiotemporal information in EEG signals that can be harnessed to enhance the diagnostics of other neurodegenerative conditions.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies demonstrated a link existed between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and cerebral disease and multisystem complications, such as dementia, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal disease, but they could be confused by confounding and reverse causality. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to figure out the causal correlation between TBI and the following complications. METHODS: Database concerning TBI and complications from genome-wide association study (GWAS) and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to examine whether TBI was causally associated with the risk of some complications. All the analysis was carried out through R, version 4.3.3. RESULTS: MR analyses indicated that any dementia has a promotional effect on TBI (OR\u2009=\u20091.067, 95% CI, 1.011-1.123, p\u2009=\u20090.017). However, there was no causal genetically association between TBI and Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), pneumonia, or gastrointestinal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to observational studies, our results uncovered little causal association between TBI and PD, AD, depression, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal diseases. Interestingly, we found any dementia might be the risk of TBI, which was a new discovery.",

Furthermore, AIS is an important risk factor for dementia. Limited evidence has shown the long-term benefit of IVT on dementia in Western countries. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the association between IVT and the risk of dementia in acute ischemic stroke patients in Asian population. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using medical records from a medical center in Taiwan between 2017 and 2022 was conducted. We included acute ischemic stroke patients aged over 55 years old who had not previously been diagnosed with dementia. The primary outcome was incident dementia ascertained through dementia diagnosis in medical records. The inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association between IVT and incident dementia. RESULTS: A total of 1471 patients with AIS were included. 939 (63.8%) were male, and the mean age was 70.7  \u00b1  9.6 years. Among them, 19.1% of patients (n\u2009=\u2009281) received IVT. The mean follow-up time was 2.6  \u00b1  1.7 years. Although not statistically significant, the IVT was associated with a decreased risk of dementia (HR: 0.88 [95%CI 0.54-1.41)]). CONCLUSIONS: The IVT was associated with lower risk of dementia, although not statistically significant, in reducing the incidence of dementia in Asian patients with ischemic stroke.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: This study explores how gut metabolites, produced through bacterial metabolism in the gut, influence neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Key metabolites such as succinate and short-chain fatty acids signal through the autonomic nervous system and can cross the blood-brain barrier, impacting central nervous system functions. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to examine the role of the gut microbiota in compensating for metabolic deficiencies in AD. By analyzing wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice, the study investigates how the microbiome affects key metabolic processes and whether it can slow AD progression. METHODS: High-throughput sequencing data from the gut microbiomes of APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice and age-matched WT C57BL/6 male mice were analyzed for microbial and metabolite profiles. RESULTS: Alpha and beta diversity analyses showed differences in microbial composition between groups. Partial least squares discriminant analysis and Anosim confirmed distinct microbiome profiles in WT and APP/PS1 mice. At the genus level, Vescimonas was more abundant in WT mice, while Odoribacter, Lacrimispora, Helicobacter, Bacteroides, and Alloprevotella were more prevalent in APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSIONS: While taxonomic differences did not directly link specific microorganisms to AD, functional analysis identified key metabolites-acetyl-CoA, glucose, succinate, lipids, choline, and acetylcholine-that may alleviate energy deficits and synaptic dysfunction. This study suggests that the microbiome may help compensate for AD-related impairments, opening avenues for microbiome-based therapies.",

Despite the lack of a cure, phenolic compounds like cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis, have emerged as potential therapeutic agents for AD. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review explores the impact of different types of cannabidiol on AD, unveiling their neuroprotective mechanisms. METHODS: The research used PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases with keywords like \"Alzheimer's disease\" and \"Cannabidiol.\" Studies were evaluated based on title, abstract, and relevance to treating AD with CBD. No restrictions on research type or publication year. Excluded were hypothesis papers, reviews, books, unavailable articles, etc. RESULTS: Microsoft Excel identified 551 articles, with 92 included in the study, but only 22 were thoroughly evaluated. In-vivo and in-silico studies indicate that CBD may disrupt A\u03b242, reduce pro-inflammatory molecule release, prevent reactive oxygen species formation, inhibit lipid oxidation, and counteract A\u03b2-induced increases in intracellular calcium, thereby protecting neurons from apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the study indicates that CBD and its analogs reduce the production of A\u03b242. Overall, these findings support the potential of CBD in alleviating the underlying pathology and symptoms associated with AD, underscoring the crucial need for further rigorous scientific investigation to elucidate the therapeutic applications and mechanisms of CBD in AD.",

However, the relationship between liver cancer and dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the association between dementia, specifically AD, and liver cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: We conducted a bidirectional, two-sample MR analysis using publicly available genome-wide association studies data. The inverse-variance weighted method was employed as the primary analytical approach. To detect and correct for the effects of horizontal pleiotropy, we applied three complementary methods: MR Egger, weighted median, and Maximum likelihood. RESULTS: The analysis indicated significant associations between dementia and a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (OR: 0.87; 95%CI: 0.81-0.95; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) (OR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.72-0.92; p\u2009<\u20090.001).

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Retina is a non-invasive channel for assessing changes in brain microvasculature, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies revealed significant relationship between clinically diagnosed AD and retinal vasculature. However, clinical diagnosis has limited sensitivity and specificity, and those investigations were conducted from traditional retinal fundus photographs which only captured a narrow section of the fundus. OBJECTIVE: Determining changes in retinal vasculature from larger area of retina between subjects with positron emission tomography (PET) biomarker-confirmed AD compared to controls. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the community and cognitive disorder clinics. Diagnosis of AD was confirmed by significant amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau uptake on PET scan. Retinal vasculature was imaged with ultra-widefield (UWF) scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and a series of vessel parameters were quantified using the semi-automated Singapore I Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software. Statistical analyses were adjusted for age, gender and systolic blood pressure. In addition, arteriole parameters were adjusted against the same measurements in venules, and vice versa. RESULTS: Out of the 39 patients, 18 had radiologically confirmed AD. These individuals with AD showed significantly smaller arteriolar fractal dimension (p\u2009=\u20090.032) in UWF images and greater venular tortuosity (p\u2009=\u20090.011) in standard fundus images compared with controls.

CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of fractal dimension in retinal arterioles observed in UWF imaging is associated with cerebral A\u03b2 and tau burden in people with biomarker-confirmed AD. Wide field retinal imaging provides an alternative perspective in demonstrating microvascular alterations related to AD in this pilot study.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Conducting longitudinal cognitive analyses is an essential part of understanding the underlying mechanism of Alzheimer's disease, especially for social and health behavior determinants. However, the cognitive test administration is highly likely to change across time and thus complicate the longitudinal analyses. The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study assessed memory through word recall tests across five study waves from 2011 to 2020. Since 2018, changes in the test stimuli and administration posed challenges for longitudinal cognitive analyses. OBJECTIVE: To address differences in administration and to preserve differences attributed to characteristics such as age and education and to derive equated scores for use in longitudinal analyses in CHARLS. METHODS: To ensure consistent underlying test ability across waves in the full sample (N\u2009=\u200919,364), we derived a calibration sample (N\u2009=\u200911,148) balancing age, gender, and education. Within this sample, we used weighted equipercentile equating to crosswalk percentile ranks between 2015 and 2018/2020 scores, then applied the algorithm to the full sample. RESULTS: Mean original delayed word recall was higher in 2018 (4.3 words) and 2020 (5.1 words) versus 2015 (3.2 words). Following equating, scores in 2018 and 2020 aligned better with previous waves (2015, 2018, 2020 immediate means: 4.1, 3.6, 4.0; delayed: 3.2, 2.4, 2.9 words). CONCLUSIONS: Equipercentile equating enables the derivation of comparable scores, facilitating longitudinal analysis when cognitive test administration procedures change over time. We recommended the use of equated scores for longitudinal analyses using CHARLS cognitive data.",

METHODS: The sample included 63 participants from a complete enumeration study of elderly people in Nakayama town (the Nakayama Study), who were over 65 years of age, diagnosed as (1) healthy controls (N\u2009=\u200921, mean age: 83.8 years), (2) having MCI due to AD (N\u2009=\u200920, mean age: 82.6 years), or (3) having AD (N\u2009=\u200921, mean age: 84.2 years). Every participant underwent blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and questionnaires about lifestyle and cognitive function. With transcriptome analysis, differential gene expressions in the blood of the three groups were evaluated by gene ontology, pathway enrichment, and ingenuity pathway analyses, and quantitative real-time PCR was performed. RESULTS: Neutrophil extracellular trap signaling was increased, and lipid metabolism (FXR/RXR activation, triacylglycerol degradation) was decreased in AD, whereas MCI showed protective responses via decreased neutrophil extracellular trap signaling and mitochondrial functions such as upregulation of the sirtuin pathway and downregulation of oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings and consistent with other published studies, immune cells appear to have important roles in the pathogenesis of AD, and the transcriptome in blood may be useful as a biomarker for diagnosis via monitoring immunity in MCI and AD.",

OBJECTIVE: This study fills a gap of knowledge by examining the associations among employment, civic engagement, and leisure activities and cognitive health by the presence of APOE \u03b54 allele, an established risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Using pooled data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Psychosocial and Lifestyle Questionnaires (2010-2016) and the HRS data on APOE \u03b54 alleles, linear regression models with a lagged dependent variable were performed to examine associations between productive or leisure activities and cognitive functioning at the follow-up time point, as well as the role of APOE \u03b54 in these associations. RESULTS: Among all participants, employment, low or high-intensity volunteering, and cognitive/social leisure activities were associated with higher levels of cognitive functioning. The presence of at least one \u03b54 allele was related to poorer cognitive functioning at the follow-up time point. Among people without the APOE \u03b54 allele, employment, high-intensity volunteering, and cognitive/social leisure activities were significantly associated with cognitive functioning. Among people with at least one APOE \u03b54 allele, low-intensity volunteering and cognitive/physical leisure activities were significantly associated with better cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: We found that employment, civic engagement, and leisure activities all contribute to cognitive health, although the benefits may be restricted to low-intensity volunteering and cognitive/physical leisure activities among individuals with at least one APOE \u03b54 allele, who are known to be inherently at a greater risk of AD, highlighting an avenue to a relatively easily implementable strategy to promote cognitive health in this subpopulation.",

METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, and Cochrane databases were searched for RCTs (January 2000-January 2024) on probiotic interventions lasting 8-24 weeks. Cognitive outcomes included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), language, naming, visual-spatial, memory, and attention.

Research outcomes on stage diagnosis using neuroimages combined with cerebrospinal fluid and genetic biomarkers are expensive and time-consuming. Only structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) scans from two internationally recognized datasets are employed as input as well as test and independent validation to determine the classification of dementia by the machine learning algorithm. OBJECTIVE: We extract the reduced dimensional latent feature vector from the sMRI scans using a variational autoencoder (VAE). The objective is to classify AD, MCI, and control (CN) using MRI and without any other information. METHODS: The extracted feature vectors from MRI scans by VAE are used as input conditions for different advanced machine-learning classifiers. Classification of AD/CN/MCI are conducted using the output of VAE from MRI images and different artificial intelligence/machine learning classifier models in two cohorts. RESULTS: Using only MRI scans, the primary goal of the study is to test the ability to classify AD from CN and MCI cases.

Corticobasal syndrome is characterized by asymmetrical involuntary movements, rigidity, apraxia, tremor, dystonia, and cortical sensory deficits. OBJECTIVE: We present the case of a 59-year-old patient with a frontotemporal presentation and parkinsonism linked to progranulin gene deletion. We also report the clinical workup needed to reach the diagnosis. METHODS: Clinical, neuropsychological, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-Flutemetamol positron emission tomography (PET), dopamine-transporter-single-photon emission computed tomography imaging, electroencephalography, and genetic evaluations were conducted. RESULTS: Our patient presented initially with executive and mnesic deficits along with the presence of apathy and loss of autonomy. Subsequently the cognitive deficits became associated with parkinsonian-like movement disorders and apraxia. Structural images showed right onset temporal and insular atrophy, and the PET images demonstrated right frontotemporal hypometabolism and the absence of amyloid in the cortex. The molecular analysis revealed a heterozygous deletion c.813_816delCACT on the GRN gene. This variant has been reported in the literature as pathogenic and associated with autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia and corticobasal degeneration. Our patient presented different clinical features than those of the members of the families already described. In these families, some patients either presented immediately with motor syndrome with extrapyramidal features, or never developed extrapyramidal signs. Some subjects presented prevalent language dysfunction while others never presented memory disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical case highlights the phenotypic variability of this entity.",

OBJECTIVE: We computationally investigated the therapeutic potential of four nootropic herbs by uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying their treatment for AD. METHODS: Cheminformatics, pharmacokinetics, and system pharmacology studies were carried out to predict the phytocompounds drug-like properties, protein targets, targets functional association and enrichment analysis. A comparative study was performed with phytocompounds and FDA-approved drugs. Investigation on the expression of protein targets in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of the AD brain was performed. Network was constructed to depict the interaction between phytocompounds, drugs, and molecular targets. RESULTS: Through comparative analysis, we found that the phytocompounds shared common targets with both FDA drugs and drugs under clinical trials. We identified potential active compounds notably, Withaferin A, Withanolide-D, Withanolide-E, Withanolide-G, and Humulene epoxide II, that can combat AD. Interestingly, the enzyme inhibition scores of the identified drugs were much higher than FDA-approved drugs. In addition, regulatory proteins such as A\u03b2PP, acetylcholinesterase, BACE1, and PTPN1 were the targets of 8, 16, 9, and 22 phytocompounds, respectively. Nonetheless, AR and CYP19A, were the primary targets of most phytocompounds. CONCLUSIONS: Herbal medicines can synergistically stimulate multiple protein targets, rendering a holistic and integrative treatment, encouraging a promising avenue to treat AD.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health problem in the aging population, with limited treatment options. We previously reported that Centella asiatica herb water extract (CAW) attenuates cognitive decline in murine models of AD and aging. OBJECTIVE: To explore changes in the hippocampal metabolome associated with CAW's modulation of cognitive function and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaque load in aged Tg2576 and wild-type (WT) mice. METHODS: We compared cognitive function, hippocampal A\u03b2 plaque burden, and hippocampal metabolite profile in 20-month-old Tg2576 female mice and their WT littermates following 3-5 weeks treatment with CAW (0, 200, or 1000\u2005mg/kg/d p.o.). Cognitive testing included contextual fear response (CFR) and novel object recognition task (NORT). A\u03b2 plaque burden was measured via immunohistochemistry. Metabolomic profiles of mouse hippocampi were obtained using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: CAW treatment resulted in dose-related improvements in CFR and NORT performance of Tg2576 and WT mice. However, while CFR correlated with neurosignaling and glycosylated ceramide levels, NORT performance correlated with lysophosphatidylcholines and oxidized metabolites, and A\u03b2 accumulation was linked to elevated excitatory and suppressed inhibitory neurotransmission. Only a subset of the metabolite changes induced by CAW in Tg2576 mice represented a reversal of metabolite differences between Tg2576 and WT mice, suggesting the involvement of other pathways in CAW's cognitive effects. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanisms underlying CAW's cognitive effects extend beyond reversing metabolic effects of A\u03b2 accumulation. The data support the potential use of CAW to manage memory challenges in aged individuals with or without AD.",

Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze assessment tools for cognitive function using the Consensus Criteria for Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) method. Comparing the validity, reliability, and practicality of these assessment tools helps clinicians select appropriate assessment tools for patients, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. Methods:We followed the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and used the COSMIN checklist to conduct a thorough methodological quality assessment of the studies. The measurement properties were evaluated and rated on a scale from excellent to poor, based on adapted criteria. We then synthesized the best evidence by combining the COSMIN outcomes with the quality of findings to ensure a precise and comprehensive analysis. Results: We identified a total of 156 publications, which included 19 different cognitive assessment instruments. Among these, the Telephone version of the Cantonese Mini-Mental State Examination (T-CMMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Hong Kong versions of the MoCA (HK-MoCA-A1 and A2) demonstrated distinguished qualities. The assessment of measurement properties included internal consistency, reliability, validity, and sensitivity and specificity. Notably, the T-CMMSE showed superior methodological quality based on our rigorous analysis. Conclusions: The T-CMMSE, MoCA, and HK-MoCA-A1 and A2 were found to be notable cognitive assessment tools for MCI and AD.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: In the sporadic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ) administration, cognitive impairment is accompanied by specific astrocytic changes in the hippocampus prior to amyloid deposition. OBJECTIVE: Hypothesizing that the synthesis of GABA, via MAO-B, contributes to ammonia elevation, thereby compromising antioxidant defense and ATP synthesis, and possibly contributing to cognitive damage, we determined the hippocampal levels of glutamine synthetase (GS), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and other enzymes related to GABA metabolism. METHODS: Immunoblotting and RT-PCR assays were carried out in hippocampal samples of Wistar rats, at 4 and 16 weeks post-STZ, in the sporadic STZ-induced AD model, corresponding to the pre-amyloid and amyloid phases, respectively. RESULTS: We observed a reduction in GS activity and increased MAO-B content, both in 4 weeks and in 16 weeks, reinforcing the idea that astroglial dysfunction precedes the amyloid phase. These alterations were accompanied by an increase in the content of ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), which catalyzes the synthesis of putrescine (substrate for GABA synthesis, via MAO-B), and a reduction in the gene expression of arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of creatine, and in the generation of GABA agonists. These changes were only seen in the amyloid phase of the AD model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to explain the greater damage that occurs in energy metabolism at this stage, in addition to the greater GABAergic loss. The changes reinforce the importance of the STZ model and further our understanding of the changes in both AD phases.",

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) offers a potential alternative. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes of DBS versus conservative treatment in patients with severe AD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 40 patients with severe AD diagnosed at the People's Liberation Army General Hospital from 2015 to 2022. Twenty patients received DBS, and twenty received conservative treatment. Treatment effects were assessed using standardized scales at three- and twelve-months post-treatment. Primary outcomes included changes in cognitive function [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale-Cognitive subscale, Clinical Dementia Rating). Secondary outcomes included quality of life, sleep quality, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregiver burden (Barthel Index, Functional Activity Questionnaire, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PDQI), Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)]. RESULTS: DBS patients showed significantly greater improvements in MMSE, MoCA, FIM, and ZBI scores than controls, suggesting improved cognitive function and quality of life, and reduced caregiver burden (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Notably, DBS significantly reduced HAM-A, HAM-D, and PSQI scores, and improved NPI scores more than controls, indicating significant amelioration of neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders (p\u2009<\u20090.05). CONCLUSIONS: DBS is a safe and reversible treatment that potentially enhances cognitive function and quality of life in severe AD patients and alleviates caregiver burden.

Hawaii's unique demographic profile, characterized by its strong ethnic diversity, shows marked racial health disparities. For instance, the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NHPI) population is identified as a high-risk group for multiple health conditions, including CVD. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of AD on the risk of developing CVD, with a focus on racial influences, utilizing Hawaii Medicare data. METHODS: Employing nine years of longitudinal Hawaii Medicare data, this study identified elderly patients diagnosed with AD who subsequently developed heart failure (HF), ischemic heart disease (IHD), atrial fibrillation (AF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or stroke. To assess the risk of CVD, we utilized multistate models and employed propensity score-matched controls. Additionally, we evaluated racial and ethnic differences in the risk of these diseases, while accounting for other relevant risk factors. RESULTS: Our findings revealed an elevated risk of AMI, HF, and IHD among individuals diagnosed with AD. Additionally, socioeconomic status (SE) was identified as a crucial factor in the risk of cardio and cerebrovascular diseases. Within the low SE group, NHPIs exhibited increased risks of HF and IHD compared to their white counterparts. Interestingly, NHPIs demonstrated reduced risks of HF in the higher SE group. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of AD increases the likelihood of developing AMI, HF, and IHD. Moreover, the risk of CVD appears to be influenced by race/ethnicity in Hawaii, as well as socioeconomic status.",

Saraswata Ghrita (SG), a traditional Ayurvedic remedy administered nasally, offers a holistic approach and is believed to directly affect brain functions through its unique delivery route. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of SG in improving cognitive function and neurochemical biomarkers in a patient with AD. Key outcomes included electroencephalography-based excitation/inhibition (fE/I) ratio, and levels of phosphorylated Tau-181 (pTau-181), serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). METHODS: A 90-day proof-of-concept clinical trial was conducted with one AD patient. Nasal administration of SG was performed twice daily. Measurements included EEG spectral power analysis across 1-48\u2005Hz, cognitive function assessed by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) scales, and biochemical analyses of pTau-181, serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and DHEA. RESULTS: Notable improvements were observed: ADAS-Cog score decreased from 40 to 36, QoL-AD score increased from 23 to 31, MMSE score improved from 13 to 18, and MoCA score increased from 8 to 13. Biochemical markers showed a decrease in pTau-181 (12.50\u2005pg/ml to 6.28\u2005pg/ml), an increase in acetylcholine (13.73\u2005pg/ml to 31.83\u2005pg/ml), while serotonin and DHEA levels rose, and dopamine levels decreased (39.14\u2005pg/ml to 36.21\u2005pg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: SG demonstrated potential in enhancing cognitive functions and neurochemical markers in AD, with the nasal route proving safe and effective.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a tool for dose optimization (DO) whereby treatment is adjusted based on previous quantification of the prescribed drug. OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether TDM-based DO of donepezil or memantine improves clinical outcomes and/or reduce the frequency of adverse reactions (ARs) in neurodegenerative conditions commonly treated with these two study drugs. METHODS: Single-blinded 1:1 randomized controlled study in an outpatient memory clinic. Eligible participants either newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) scheduled for treatment with donepezil or memantine. The intervention group received TDM based DO. The control group received DO solely based on clinical assessment. Clinical outcomes were change in Mini-Mental State Examination, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Disability Assessment in Dementia from baseline to 12 months. Additionally, data on incidence and severity of ARs and proportion of participants with a serum concentration within the therapeutic reference range were collected. RESULTS: 132 participants recruited (125 AD, 7 DLB, none with PDD) of whom 107 completed the study (101 AD and 6 DLB), fewer in the control group than planned. Statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences between groups neither for clinical outcomes nor for frequency of ARs. CONCLUSIONS: TDM based DO did not significantly improve clinical outcomes nor reduce the frequency of ARs albeit important caveats to the results apply.

Understanding these overlaps may aid in identifying common diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. OBJECTIVE: This study identifies shared diagnostic genes and mechanisms linking AD and VaD. METHODS: Datasets GSE5281 and GSE122063 from the GEO database were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Intersection DEGs were analyzed using KEGG and GO enrichment to explore signaling pathways. A PPI network was constructed, and LASSO and SVM-RFE were applied to identify core genes. CIBERSORT assessed immune cell composition and their relationship with core genes. Diagnostic efficacy was evaluated using ROC curves, nomogram, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). Core genes were used to identify characteristic genes in various brain regions of AD patients. RESULTS: The analysis identified 9021 DEGs for AD and 373 DEGs for VaD, with 74 co-expressed genes and 8 core genes. ROC curves, nomogram, and DCA indicated high diagnostic accuracy. Core gene analysis revealed differential expression of characteristic genes in various brain regions of AD patients. CONCLUSIONS: This research identified 74 co-expressed genes and 8 pivotal diagnostic genes. These genes likely play roles in signal transduction, neuroinflammation, and autophagy in both AD and VaD. The findings offer potential targets for future research and clinical interventions.

OBJECTIVE: To complete epigenetic canonical pathways analyses related to AD in individuals with and without high-impact knee pain. METHODS: This manuscript aimed to explore differences in DNA methylation patterns in genes and pathways associated with AD. Blood samples of cognitively intact, community-dwelling adults with high impact knee painmversus pain-free controls were compared on their DNA methylation levels of AD-related genes. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed on significantly different DNA Methylation probes by pain group. RESULTS: There were significant DNA methylation differences between the high impact versus the pain-free control groups in genes and pathways associated with AD (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Although VR applications have shown positive results, their impact on user experience and therapeutic outcomes still needs to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to analyze existing studies on VR use in older adults with neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on the factors that influence usability, satisfaction, and immersion, as well as the effects on emotional and cognitive well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Empirical studies in English were included on VR applications applied to older adults with cognitive impairment without study design restrictions. The search was conducted in IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, identifying a total of 650 initial results. After screening, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Immersive VR tends to generate a greater sense of presence, which contributes to improving emotional well-being and reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy and depression. However, its impact on cognitive functions, including memory and executive skills, varied depending on the level of immersion and participant characteristics. Despite these positive findings, significant heterogeneity was evident in study designs, measurement instruments, and user experience indicators. CONCLUSION: Virtual environments have great potential as a therapeutic tool for older adults, but their success depends on the personalization of applications and the adaptation of technology to the specific needs of this population.

        "AbstractText": "Brain atrophy is one of the most common features of neurodegenerative diseases and is particularly critical in the early diagnosis of conditions like Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis. Automated segmentation and quantification are highly desirable in brain atrophy evaluation but existing methods require high-quality MRI scans with isotropic resolution. However in practice, clinicians usually choose to reduce the number of slices to save time, and because of their anisotropic resolution, the morphometric analysis cannot be implemented. Here we propose the use of an inter-slice interpolation network to increase spatial resolution to isotropic to accomplish morphometric analysis of brain atrophy, which is not feasible to perform with clinical scans. To achieve fully automated quantification, we set up a series of indicators that cover multiple aspects such as holistic and localized, structural and cortical, based on our clinical experience. As a result, a fully automated diagnostic process for pathological brain atrophy is completed. Our results on the IXI and ADNI datasets show that the slice spacing method produces realistic and reliable anatomy and achieves high diagnostic accuracy, and our indicators are well suited to clinical application scenarios.",

However, neuronal activity in the hippocampus is difficult to monitor and study in human AD patients. Thus, it is critical to have an animal model that resembles closely human AD. The newly developed APPNL-G-F rat model, which is a knock-in rat line of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with Swedish-Beyreuther/Iberian-Arctic mutations, presents a unique opportunity. In this study, we investigated how hippocampal place cells and neural rhythms were impaired in APP rats. Place cells of APP rats showed a less defined spatial tunning and disrupted remapping. In addition, APP rats exhibited decreased power of theta rhythm and slow gamma rhythm. These results suggest that the impairment of spatial memory in APP rats may be caused by the damage of place cells' ability to represent spatial location and abnormal neural rhythm in the hippocampus.",

        "AbstractText": "This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the phenomenon of data redundancy in video understanding, with the aim to improve computational efficiency. Our investigation commences with an examination of spatial redundancy, which refers to the observation that the most informative region in each video frame usually corresponds to a small image patch, whose shape, size and location shift smoothly across frames. Motivated by this phenomenon, we formulate the patch localization problem as a dynamic decision task, and introduce a spatially adaptive video recognition approach, termed AdaFocus. In specific, a lightweight encoder is first employed to quickly process the full video sequence, whose features are then utilized by a policy network to identify the most task-relevant regions. Subsequently, the selected patches are inferred by a high-capacity deep network for the final prediction. The complete model can be trained conveniently in an end-to-end manner. During inference, once the informative patch sequence has been generated, the bulk of computation can be executed in parallel, rendering it efficient on modern GPU devices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AdaFocus can be easily extended by further considering the temporal and sample- wise redundancies, i.e., allocating the majority of computation to the most task-relevant video frames, and minimizing the computation spent on relatively \"easier\" videos. Our resulting algorithm, Uni-AdaFocus, establishes a comprehensive framework that seamlessly integrates spatial, temporal, and sample- wise dynamic computation, while it preserves the merits of AdaFocus in terms of efficient end-to-end training and hardware friendliness. In addition, Uni-AdaFocus is general and flexible as it is compatible with off-the-shelf backbone models (e.g., TSM and X3D), which can be readily deployed as our feature extractor, yielding a significantly improved computational efficiency. Empirically, extensive experiments based on seven widely-used benchmark datasets (i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&V2, Jester, and Kinetics-400) and three real-world application scenarios (i.e., fine-grained diving action classification, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases diagnosis with brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), and violence recognition for online videos) substantiate that Uni-AdaFocus is considerably more efficient than the competitive baselines.

This integration introduces a new paradigm in AI-driven medical imaging, particularly in assessing brain age'a crucial marker for detecting age-related neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite advances in deep learning for estimating brain age from structural MRI (sMRI), incorporating functional MRI (fMRI) data presents significant challenges due to its complex data structure and the noisy nature of functional connectivity measurements. To address these challenges, we present the Multitask Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (M-AVAE), a bespoke deep learning framework designed to enhance brain age predictions through multimodal MRI data integration. The M-AVAE uniquely separates latent variables into generic and unique codes, effectively isolating shared and modality-specific features. Additionally, integrating multitask learning with sex classification as a supplementary task enables the model to account for sex-specific aging nuances. Evaluated on the OpenBHB dataset'a comprehensive multisite brain MRI aggregation-the M-AVAE demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a mean absolute error of 2.77 years, surpassing conventional methodologies.

Performance was assessed based on predictive accuracy, discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: The cohort included 267\u2009460 females and 233\u2009410 males. Premature deaths occurred in 1.40% of females and 2.05% of males. Primary models had 12 predictors (females) and 13 predictors (males). Shared predictors included age, income quintile, education, self-perceived health, smoking, emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer and stroke. Male-specific predictors were marital status, Alzheimer's disease and arthritis while female-specific predictors were body mass index and physical activity. External validation cohort differed slightly in demographics. Female model performance: split set (c-statistic: 0.852), external (c-statistic: 0.856). Male model performance: split set and external (c-statistic: 0.846). Calibration showed slight overprediction for high-risk individuals and good calibration in key subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: PreMPoRT achieved the strongest discrimination and calibration among existing prediction models for premature mortality. The model produces reliable estimates of future incidence of premature mortality and may be used to identify subgroups who may benefit from public health interventions.",

        "AbstractText": "Recent advances in digital technologies hold promise for supporting aging adults and their care partners as they navigate changes in cognitive and daily functioning associated with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Commonly owned digital technologies, like smartphones, include features that could help maintain independence and reduce caregiver burden. However, we lack models for successful integration of technologies into treatment of persons with ADRD. We propose the Technology Assistance in Dementia (Tech-AiD) framework for aiding persons with ADRD and their care partners with using digital technologies to reach individualized goals. We discuss how technology use is impacted by a multitude of factors, including severity of cognitive impairment, technology proficiency, and barriers to adequate and equitable care, all of which are further complicated by health disparities. Further, we explore the potential benefits of technology use among patients with ADRD and their care partners, highlighting pertinent clinical and ethical challenges and drawing from evidence-based strategies to promote practical recommendations.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this observational clinical study was to evaluate the relationship between brain anatomical and volumetric changes in white matter, grey matter, and cerebral cortex thickness with the number of functional occlusal pairs present in the mouth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The number of functional occlusal pairs in 70 patients was counted and non-invasive brain analysis was performed using magnetic resonance imaging. The volume of grey matter, white matter, and thickness of the cortex in different areas of the brain were determined by SPM12 and CAT12 software. Multiple regression model corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR and Spearman correlation coefficient were calculated for statistical comparison. RESULTS: A total of 70 (39 male, 31 female) were analysed, with an average number of occlusal pairs of 10.21 (3.99). According to the Spearman correlation coefficient, a lower number of occlusal pairs was related to a reduction in white matter (right external capsule and posterior limb of the internal capsule), a reduction in grey matter (right temporal superior and medial gyrus and left cerebellum crus 1) and a reduction in thickness of the cerebral cortex (rostral anterior cingulated cortex of the right hemisphere and areas in the right and left hemisphere, especially in the frontal cortex). CONCLUSIONS: The number of occlusal pairs is related to the volume of white matter, grey matter, and thickness of the cerebral cortex in areas of the brain that are directly involved in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.",

This knowledge indicates a potential role of PGC-1\u03b1 in a wide range of functions associated with neurological diseases. There is emerging evidence indicating a protective role of PGC-1\u03b1 in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases. As such, a deeper and broader understanding of PGC-1\u03b1 and its role in neurological diseases is urgently needed. The present review provides a relatively complete overview of the current knowledge on PGC-1\u03b1, including its functions in different types of neurons, basic structural characteristics, and its interacting transcription factors. Furthermore, we present the role of PGC-1\u03b1 in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases, such as intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and other PolyQ diseases. Importantly, we discuss some compounds or drug-targeting strategies that have been studied to ameliorate the pathology of these neurological diseases and introduce the possible mechanistic pathways.

The neurodegeneration of brain connectivity networks plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of MCI. Traditionally, brain networks are generated using coarse-grained brain regions, where the regions serve as nodes and their functional or structural connections are used as edges. Recently, a novel finer scale brain folding patterns named 3-hinge gyrus (3HG) was identified, which is defined as the conjunctions coming from three directions on gyral crests. 3HGs have been shown playing an important role in brain network and can serve as hubs. In this study, our objective is to construct a novel 3HG-based finer-scale brain connectome and comprehensively compare its performance with traditional region-based connectome in predicting MCI against Normal Controls (NC). The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of 3HG-based brain connectome, shedding light on the potential of 3HG-based connectomes in capturing intricate neurodegenerative patterns associated with MCI and AD.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic, neurodegenerative condition that leads to a significant cognitive decline. One of the symptoms that greatly reduces the quality of daily functioning is the deterioration of spatial orientation abilities. A non-pharmacological treatment option for Alzheimer's disease, which is also employed to improve the cognitive functioning of individuals with mild cognitive impairment, is virtual reality training. OBJECTIVE: To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no existing systematic review on the use of virtual reality training to enhance spatial orientation in individuals with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment. The review was therefore conducted to fill this gap. The findings of this review may support the efficacy of virtual reality in enhancing spatial orientation. METHODS: Five databases were searched. The primary inclusion criteria were study participants aged over 60 years with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment and the use of virtual reality for improving spatial orientation. Six studies meeting these criteria were ultimately included in the review. RESULTS: All included studies demonstrated an improvement in the spatial orientation of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment following virtual reality training. This indicates the effectiveness of virtual reality technology in cognitive rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: As virtual reality cognitive training has proven effective, its use should be more widely adopted. Further research on the application of virtual reality for enhancing spatial orientation in individuals with dementia is recommended.",

Research focused on the epidemiology of EOD will improve early detection and diagnosis, and the understanding of its impact on individuals and society. OBJECTIVE: The study seeks to describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of people diagnosed with EOD in an outpatient memory clinic. METHOD: A retrospective quantitative case series to investigate the pattern and characteristics of people diagnosed with EOD attending a Psychogeriatric Clinic in Southwestern Nigeria. Data were collected manually from the medical case records of people with dementia who attended the psychogeriatric clinic. RESULTS: The subjects' mean \u00b1 SD age was 60.2 \u00b1 4.2 years and 50% were females. The most common medical comorbidity was hypertension (50.0%). Depression (15.8%) was the most common behavioral symptom. Alzheimer's dementia (50.0%) was the predominant dementia type. There was a significant difference in the age (p=0.001), Boston naming test (p=0.011), based on the educational status of the participants. The neuropsychological profile of the participants showed low scores in some specific domains like memory and language.

We evaluated and compared risk of incident stroke and dementia between old and new equations of eGFR for African American and non-African American participants. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Baseline values were collected from 6,814 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort between 2000 and 2002. Participants were followed up until 2018. The analytic sample consisted of 6,646 participants (mean [SD] age 62 [10] years; 53% female; 39% White, 27% African American, 12% Chinese American, and 22% Hispanic/Latino). EXPOSURE: eGFR equation from 2021 based on serum creatinine and cystatin C levels without race. OUTCOME: Incident stroke and dementia. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Cox proportional regression adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables was performed to estimate associations between different eGFR measures and risk of incident stroke and dementia. RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 17\u00a0years, 349 (5.3%) participants experienced an incident stroke event, and 574 (8.6%) participants experienced incident dementia. In the fully adjusted model, overall participants with eGFR\u00a0<60 compared with those\u00a0>90\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 were at significantly increased risk of dementia (HR, 95% CI: 1.73, 1.21-2.45). A lower eGFR was not significantly associated with incident stroke (1.30, 0.75-2.24). African American participants tended to be reclassified to a lower group of eGFR in the new equations, whereas non-African American participants were reclassified to a higher group of eGFR. When comparing older versus newer equations of eGFR in African American and non-African American participants in association with incident stroke and dementia, differences were minimal. LIMITATIONS: Incident dementia was ascertained through International Classification of Diseases (Ninth and Tenth Revisions) codes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate participants with 2021 eGFR\u00a0<\u00a060 compared with those with eGFR\u00a0>\u00a090\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 have higher risk of dementia in both African American and non-African American participants, but not of stroke.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer disease (AD), a continuous disease spectrum, includes the symptomatic stages of the period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the dementia period, also known as AD dementia. Focusing on MCI and AD dementia screening, i.e., AD spectrum screening, we analyzed the value of plasma biomarkers for diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in the local populations of Deyang City, Sichuan Province, China to provide evidence for the early screening and diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted between August 2023 and October 2023 among people aged 50 years or older in Deyang City, Sichuan Province. The survey covered demographic information, information on medical history, and cognitive function assessment. Subjects with MCI were included in the MCI group, those with AD dementia were included in the AD group, and the others were included in the healthy controls (HC) group. A partial sample, including all patients with AD dementia and a randomized sample of MCI patients and HC, was drawn. Then, the plasma levels of four cognition-related biomarkers, including phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217), were measured using an ultrasensitive digital chip immunoassay technology independently developed in China. Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) deposition was determined by positron emission tomography (PET) using A\u03b2 molecular probes in all AD dementia patients and some of the MCI patients. The diagnostic value of the plasma biomarkers for cognitive dysfunction was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 2833 subjects were investigated, including 30 (1.1%) with AD dementia, 437 (15.4%) with MCI, and 2366 (83.5%) with HC. We measured the plasma levels of 4 biomarkers of 30 AD dementia patients, 50 MCI patients, and 35 HC. Plasma p-tau217 performed best in differentiating AD dementia from HC and MCI, with the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curves being 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-1.00) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87-0.98), respectively. Plasma p-tau217 levels in the AD dementia, MCI, and HC groups were (2.32\u00b11.27), (0.54\u00b10.45), and (0.42\u00b10.19) pg/mL, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.0001). A total of 36 patients underwent A\u03b2 PET examination. Plasma p-tau217 showed the best performance in the diagnosis of A\u03b2 deposition (AUC: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.96-1.00). Plasma p-tau217 levels were higher in A\u03b2-deposition-positive patients ([2.52\u00b11.17] pg/mL) than those in A\u03b2-deposition-negative patients ([0.53\u00b10.19] pg/mL), and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.0001). Plasma p-tau217 levels were significantly and positively correlated with A\u03b2 PET uptake values in multiple brain regions of the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes (r>0.70, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Plasma biomarkers measured with a technology independently developed in China demonstrate good performance in diagnosing AD dementia. Plasma p-tau217, in particular, demonstrates the highest diagnostic value and can be used for AD dementia screening of large populations.",

We examined cross-sectional associations between circulating stress biomarkers and multimodal measures of brain health and cognition susceptible to AD in older adults and sex-specific subgroups. METHODS: Baseline data from 132 cognitively unimpaired participants without depression (age, mean \u00b1 SD\u00a0= 74.0\u00a0\u00b1 4.0 years, women: n\u00a0= 80) in the Age-Well trial (NCT02977819) were included. Stress hormone levels were measured in overnight fasting blood serum (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) and blood plasma (epinephrine, norepinephrine) samples. AD-sensitive measures of brain health, including glucose metabolism (n\u00a0= 89), cerebral perfusion, gray matter volume, amyloid deposition in a priori regions of interest, and cognitive markers were evaluated. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, trait anxiety, and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Higher epinephrine levels were associated (false discovery rate-corrected p < .05) with lower glucose metabolism in the anterior cingulate cortex (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.26, p\u00a0= .008), posterior cingulate cortex (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.32, p\u00a0= .006), and precuneus (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.27, p\u00a0= .021) and lower perfusion in the posterior cingulate cortex (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.23, p\u00a0= .013).

        "AbstractText": "Mendelian randomization (MR) assesses the total effect of exposure on outcome. With the rapidly increasing availability of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs), MR leverages existing summary statistics and is widely used to study the causal effects among complex traits and diseases. The total effect in the population is a sum of indirect and direct effects. For complex disease outcomes with complicated etiologies, and/or for modifiable exposure traits, there may exist more than one pathway between exposure and outcome. The direct effect and the indirect effect via a mediator of interest could be of opposite directions, and the total effect estimates may not be informative for treatment and prevention decision-making or may be even misleading for different subgroups of patients. Causal mediation analysis delineates the indirect effect of exposure on outcome operating through the mediator and the direct effect transmitted through other mechanisms. However, causal mediation analysis often requires individual-level data measured on exposure, outcome, mediator and confounding variables, and the power of the mediation analysis is restricted by sample size. In this work, motivated by a study of the effects of atrial fibrillation (AF) on Alzheimer's dementia, we propose a framework for Integrative Mendelian randomization and Mediation Analysis (IMMA). The proposed method integrates the total effect estimates from MR analyses based on large-scale GWASs with the direct and indirect effect estimates from mediation analysis based on individual-level data of a limited sample size. We introduce a series of IMMA models, under the scenarios with or without exposure-mediator interaction and/or study heterogeneity. The proposed IMMA models improve the estimation and the power of inference on the direct and indirect effects in the population, as well as the characterization of the variation of effects. Our analyses showed a significant positive direct effect of AF on Alzheimer's dementia risk not through the use of the oral anticoagulant treatment and a significant indirect effect of AF-induced anticoagulant treatment in reducing Alzheimer's dementia risk. The results suggested potential Alzheimer's dementia risk prediction and prevention strategies for AF patients, and paved the way for future re-evaluation of anticoagulant treatment guidelines for AF patients. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the sensitivity of the conclusions to a key assumption of the IMMA approach.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive breakdown of neuronal structure and function and the pathological accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates and toxic protein oligomers. A major contributor to the deterioration of neuronal physiology is the disruption of protein catabolic pathways mediated by the proteasome, a large protease complex responsible for most cellular protein degradation. Previously, it was believed that proteolysis by the proteasome required tagging of protein targets with polyubiquitin chains, a pathway called the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Because of this, most research on proteasomal roles in neurodegeneration has historically focused on the UPS. However, additional ubiquitin-independent pathways and their importance in neurodegeneration are increasingly recognized. In this review, we discuss the range of ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathways, focusing on substrate identification and targeting, regulatory molecules and adaptors, proteasome activators and alternative caps, and diverse proteasome complexes including the 20S proteasome, the neuronal membrane proteasome, the immunoproteasome, extracellular proteasomes, and hybrid proteasomes. These pathways are further discussed in the context of aging, oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, with a special focus on Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. A mechanistic understanding of ubiquitin-independent proteasome function and regulation in neurodegeneration is critical for the development of therapies to treat these devastating conditions.

METHODS: Using Global Burden of Disease data (GBD 2021), we analyzed the global HFPG-related ADOD burden from 1990 to 2021 using an age-period-cohort framework and predicted trends for 2050. A Shiny platform was developed to visualize the disease burden and trends across 204 countries and regions. RESULTS: In 2021, approximately 15% of ADOD deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributed to HFPG, a 271.05% increase from 1990. The incidence rate rose from 47.07 to 66.42, indicating poor control. The mortality rate from HFPG-ADOD increased by 305.81%. The primary burden was among the 80-84 age group. Trends in ASDR and ASMR showed an increase across most SDI regions, except Low SDI. Decomposition analysis and the APC model indicated poor control in high SDI regions due to aging populations over the past 5\u202fyears. By 2050, the global prevalence is projected to reach 1,003,018.047 (26124.40377, 12114480.49), with 345,342.5738 (1431.57781, 6022119.213) males and 657,675.4731 (24692.82596, 6092361.28) females. The Shiny platform predicts a yearly increase in ASDR and ASMR for HFPG-ADOD in China, which is consistent with GBD platform trends. The platform is accessible at http://116.196.73.86:3838/GBD/HFPG-ADOD/. CONCLUSION: The global burden of HFPG-related ADOD has been increasing, even in high SDI regions, over the past 5\u202fyears and is expected to continue rising until 2050. Implementing appropriate health policies to mitigate this trend could significantly reduce the substantial burden caused by HFPG-induced ADOD. Promoting the use of the Shiny prediction platform will contribute significantly to global healthy aging.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: With the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) increasing exponentially, there has been a shift in the focus of drug discovery for AD from treating the symptoms to preventing the development of the disease. Several natural compounds are extensively studied as neuroprotectives in preventing disease progression. Helianthus annuus seed oil (HA) is widely used as cooking oil and is abundant in antioxidant activity. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of HA in mice model of scopolamine-induced amnesia and explored the potential underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Twenty-four male mice were administered orally with either distilled water (control and scopolamine groups) or treatment groups (HA 100 and HA 200 mg/kg) for 8 consecutive days. All groups, except the control group, received an intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Subsequently, novel object recognition task for cognition assessment and open field tests for locomotory activity were performed. In addition, network analysis was performed to identify the key bioactives and targets of HA against AD. Further, the binding affinity of HA bioactives to the key targets was verified by molecular docking analysis. RESULTS: HA (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated recognition memory compared to the scopolamine group, suggesting the protective effect of HA against cognitive impairment. Network analysis indicated that the key bioactives of HA, chlorogenic acid, and oleic acid act through multiple targets and pathways, particularly the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, to ameliorate AD symptoms. Importantly, chlorogenic acid showed good binding affinity with MAPKs, TP53, and EP300. CONCLUSION: HA has therapeutic benefits in AD acting through the MAPK pathway. However, further studies need to be done to confirm the results derived and translate the potential use of HA as a dietary supplement for preventing AD.",

Six had globus pallidus internus DBS (primarily for dystonia). Only 16.1% of patients were government-funded. Of the 133 PD patients operated in the past decade (2013-2022), 25 (18.8%) had disease duration <5 years.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most commonly occurring neurodegenerative disease. However, current diagnostics for AD primarily rely on invasive tests, which limit the application of diagnostic procedures in early screening. Speech, as a noninvasive biomarker, is closely associated with AD but has not been fully leveraged as a diagnostic tool. This study develops a novel early AD diagnosis method that uses primitive speech and explores its potential application in community screening. Moreover, the study proposes an innovative multimodal method for speech feature fusion that combines acoustic and semantic information to differentiate patients with AD from normal controls. This method uses the ImageBind audio encoder to extract acoustic features and the Embeddings from Language Model to extract semantic features, thereby effectively integrating the features by mid-level fusion. The training set comprises 166 speech recordings, which comprise 87 samples from individuals with AD and 79 samples from healthy control subjects. The ratio of training set to test set is 7:3. Evaluation of the Alzheimer dementia recognition through spontaneous speech only dataset showed that the proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 0.903 and a recall rate of 1, and it considerably outperformed existing baseline models, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach to AD diagnosis. This study applies the multimodal fusion of speech features to an early AD diagnostic procedure and achieves excellent performance. The findings of this study not only provide a new approach to noninvasive AD screening but also open new pathways to the early diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, and there have been no systematic studies of Polygonatum against Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, our study will elucidate the mechanism of Polygonatum against AD based on network pharmacology and molecular docking. The active ingredients and corresponding targets of Polygonatum were identified using the traditional Chinese medicine systematic pharmacology database and analysis platform. Disease targets of AD were retrieved from the therapeutic target database, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, GeneCards, and Disgenet databases. Using the STRING database, we constructed protein interaction networks and performed gene ontology functional enrichment analysis as well as Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment analysis on common targets. We then drew drug-component-target-pathway-disease network maps using Cytoscape 3.10.1 software and validated the molecular docking using AutoDock4. A total of 10 active ingredients and 108 common targets were screened from Polygonatum, 29 genes (including AKT1 and STAT3) were identified as core genes. According to gene ontology analysis, the core targets were found to be mainly involved in signal transduction, positive regulation of gene expression, negative regulation of the apoptotic process, and so on. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis revealed that the signaling pathways comprised pathways in cancer, pathways of neurodegeneration - multiple diseases, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The molecular docking results indicated that 10 of active ingredients from Polygonatum exhibited strong binding affinity with the 6 core targets that were screened before. The activity of Polygonatum against AD could be attributed to the regulation of multiple biological effects via multi-pathways (pathways in cancer, pathways of neurodegeneration - multiple diseases, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway). The binding activities were estimated as good level by molecular docking. These discoveries disclosed the multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway characteristics of Polygonatum against AD, providing a new strategy for such medical problem.",

Traditional diagnostic tools, such as intracranial volume assessments, electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have shown utility in detecting the disease. However, artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise for automating this process, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy and accessibility. METHODS: In this study, various machine learning models were used to detect Alzheimer disease, including K-nearest neighbor regression, support vector machines (SVM), AdaBoost regression, and logistic regression. A neural network was constructed and validated using data from 150 participants in the University of Washington's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Open Access Imaging Studies Series [OASIS] dataset). Cross-validation was also performed on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to assess the robustness of the models. RESULTS: Among the models tested, K-nearest neighbor regression achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 97.33%. The cross-validation on the ADNI dataset further confirmed the effectiveness of the models, demonstrating satisfactory results in screening and diagnosing Alzheimer disease in a community-based sample. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that AI-based models, particularly K-nearest neighbor regression, provide promising accuracy for the early detection of Alzheimer disease.

CLUSTERIN (CLU), a chaperone protein expressed in the brain and found in relatively high concentrations in plasma, is a promising candidate. CLU contributes to the elimination of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), which is associated to neurofibrillary tangles and to the genetic risk for AD. We performed a longitudinal measurement of CLU in the brain and the plasma in 3xTgAD mice. Assessment of CLU was also conducted in 12-month-old TgF344-AD rats. In humans, brain CLU was measured in non-demented and in AD subjects. The plasma CLU was longitudinally measured in four cohorts defined as healthy controls that remained stable, healthy controls that presented a cognitive decline between the two measures, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that presented a cognitive decline between the two measures and AD. A validation cohort composed of 19 MCI was used and plasma CLU was measured before and after conversion in AD. Increases in CLU were measured in the hippocampus of 3xTgAD and TgF344-AD animals in the absence of plasmatic changes. CLU is heterogeneously expressed in the hippocampus in non-demented individuals and increased in AD. In the plasma, two CLU levels were measured: low in controls and MCI, and high in AD. To validate that the elevation in CLU is associated with conversion to AD, a replication study showed, in a second group MCI patients converting to AD in the follow-up that CLU levels increased in 16/19 individuals. The increase in brain CLU occurs in AD models as in humans, and seems to precede plasma variations, which could make it an AD therapeutic target. Plasma CLU seems to be a promising marker of cognitive decline, and its association with AD may be a useful complementary diagnostic tool.",

We previously reported that upregulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) protein in reactive astrocytes contributes to neuroinflammation and cognitive function deficits in murine models of ischemic stroke and vascular stenosis. In this study, we utilized AD human post-mortem and APP/PS1dE9 (APP) transgenic mouse brain tissues to determine whether NHE1 upregulation in astrocytes is associated with AD pathogenesis. In both AD human and APP mouse brain tissues, a significant elevation of NHE1 protein expression was detected in glial fibrillary acidic protein expressing (GFAP+) reactive astrocytes in cortical and hippocampal regions, compared to control groups. Furthermore, increased astrocytic NHE1 protein and GFAP protein were detected in proximity to amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques in APP mouse brains. We then tested the efficacy of pharmacological NHE1 inhibition using its inhibitor, HOE642, in attenuating pathogenesis in APP mice. Vehicle-treated APP mice (APP.Veh) exhibited hyperactive locomotor behavior at 4-months and 7-months of age, compared to wild-type littermates (WT.Veh). In contrast, APP mice-treated with HOE642 (APP.HOE) displayed significantly lower hyperactive locomotor behavior (p<0.01). Additionally, APP.HOE mice showed decreased density of amyloid fibrils. In summary, we detected NHE1 protein upregulation in reactive astrocytes in both AD human and APP brains.

        "AbstractText": "Tauopathy is a spectrum of diseases characterized by fibrillary tau aggregate formation in neurons and glial cells in the brain. Tau aggregation originates in the brainstem and entorhinal cortex and then spreads throughout the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most prevalent type of tauopathy. Understanding the mechanism by which locally developed tau pathology propagates throughout the brain is crucial for comprehending AD pathogenesis. Therefore, a novel model of tau pathology that artificially induces tau aggregation in targeted cells at specific times is essential. This study describes a novel optogenetic module, OptoTau, which is a human tau with the P301L mutation fused with a photosensitive protein CRY2olig, inducing various forms of tau according to the temporal pattern of blue light illumination pattern. Continuous blue light illumination for 12 h to Neuro2a cells that stably express OptoTau (OptoTauKI cells) formed clusters along microtubules, many of which eventually accumulated in aggresomes. Conversely, methanol-resistant tau aggregation was formed when alternating light exposure and darkness in 30-min cycles for 8 sets per day were repeated over 8 days. Methanol-resistant tau was induced more rapidly by repeating 5-min illumination followed by 25-min darkness over 24 h. These results indicate that OptoTau induced various tau aggregation stages based on the temporal pattern of blue light exposure. Thus, this technique exhibits potential as a novel approach to developing specific tau aggregation in targeted cells at desired time points.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the different clinical phenotypes according to the MDS-PSP classification on prognosis using the clinical milestones of death, severe dysphagia, institutionalization, and need for walking aid. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 205 PSP patients from Lille University Hospital was analyzed retrospectively. Patients were classified into different MSD-PSP phenotypes according to their clinical presentation after 3 years of follow-up. The milestones of death, severe dysphagia, institutionalization, and need for walking aid were recorded, and a survival analysis was performed to describe the prognosis of each disease presentation.

They catalyze the hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate and protons and are involved in pH regulation, chemosensing, and metabolism. The 15 \u03b1-CA isoforms present in humans are pharmacological drug targets known for decades, their inhibitors being used as diuretics, antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, or antiobesity drugs, as well as for the management of acute mountain sickness, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and recently, as antitumor theragnostic agents. Other potential applications include the use of CA inhibitors (CAIs) in inflammatory conditions, cerebral ischemia, neuropathic pain, or Alzheimer/Parkinson disease management. CAs from pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoans, and nematodes have started to be considered as drug targets in recent years, with notable advances being registered. CAIs have a complex multipharmacology probably unique to this enzyme, which has been exploited intensely but may lead to other relevant applications in the future due to the emergence of drug design approaches that afforded highly isoform-selective compounds for most \u03b1-CAs known to date. They belong to a multitude of chemical classes (sulfonamides and isosteres, [iso]coumarins and related compounds, mono- and dithiocarbamates, selenols, ninhydrines, boronic acids, benzoxaboroles, etc). The polypharmacology of CAIs will also be discussed because drugs originally discovered for the treatment of non-CA related conditions (topiramate, zonisamide, celecoxib, pazopanib, thiazide, and high-ceiling diuretics) show effective inhibition against many CAs, which led to their repurposing for diverse pharmacological applications.

They embody AD pathogenesis because they harbor in one space critical pathologic features of the disease: amyloid deposits, neurofibrillary degeneration, neuroinflammation, and iron accumulation. Neuritic plaques are thought to arise from the conversion of diffuse extracellular deposits of amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2), and it is believed that during conversion, amyloid toxicity creates the dystrophic neurites of neuritic plaques, as well as neurofibrillary tangles However, recent evidence from human postmortem studies suggests a much different mechanism of neuritic plaque formation, where the first step in their creation is neuronal degeneration driven by iron overload and ferroptosis. Similarly, neurofibrillary tangles represent the corpses of iron-laden neurons that develop independently of A\u03b2 deposits. In this review, we will focus on the role of free redox-active iron in the development of typical AD pathology, as determined largely by evidence obtained in the human temporal lobe during early, preclinical stages of AD. The findings have allowed the construction of a scheme of AD pathogenesis where brain iron is center stage and is involved in every step of the sequence of events that produce characteristic AD pathology. We will discuss how the study of preclinical AD has produced a fresh and revised assessment of AD pathogenesis that may be important for reconsidering current therapeutic efforts and guiding future ones. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review offers a novel perspective on Alzheimer disease pathogenesis where elevated brain iron plays a central role and is involved throughout the development of lesions. Herein, we review arguments against the amyloid cascade theory and explain how recent findings in humans during early preclinical disease support iron-mediated cell death and endogenous iron containment mechanisms as critical components of neuritic plaque formation and ensuing dementia.",

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across Cochrane, PubMed, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception to April 10, 2024. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating cognitive outcomes in patients with MCI or AD using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). RESULTS: From an initial pool of 6,687 articles, 45 were deemed relevant for qualitative analysis. Of these, 37 studies demonstrated improvements or positive trends in cognitive outcomes with natural compound or extract supplementation. A total of 35 studies met the criteria for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis, involving 4,974 participants, revealed significant improvements in ADAS-Cog scores (pooled standardized mean difference\u202f=\u202f-2.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.26 to -1.50; t24\u202f=\u202f-4.31, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) following supplementation.

We report our experience with palliative treatment for a terminal oral cancer patient with dementia who wished for home palliative care. The patient was an 87-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia and chronic heart failure. In late September 2022, he visited a nearby internal medicine clinic with complaints of loss of appetite and pain in the right maxillary gingiva and was referred to a tertiary medical institution in the prefecture for further examination and treatment. At the initial visit, a 40\u00d730 mm easily bleeding ulcerative lesion was observed in the right maxillary molar gingiva. Based on various examinations, he was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the right maxillary gingiva(cT4bN0M0, Stage \u2163B). However, due to dementia and severe cardiac dysfunction, he was not eligible for chemoradiotherapy and a plan for palliative treatment was made. The patient strongly wished for treatment at home and at a local hospital, and palliative treatment with a view to home palliative care was initiated. He was admitted to our internal medicine department in mid-November. Our department continued local treatment for the tumor and specialized oral care by a dental hygienist, but he passed away due to cardiac arrest in early January 2023. Although the patient passed away before transitioning to home care, smooth implementation of home palliative care requires cooperation not only from hospitals but also from the entire community, and the establishment of a comprehensive home medical support system is crucial.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of anti-tau protein monoclonal antibodies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau protein aggregation, a key pathological feature of AD, is closely associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Targeting tau protein has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. By investigating the effects of monoclonal antibodies on cognitive function, disease progression, and overall quality of life in patients with AD, which can provide valuable insights into their potential as a therapeutic option for this devastating neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of Gosuranemab, Semorinemab, Tilavonemab, and Zagotenemab in Alzheimer's disease (AD) were systematically searched across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library, up to May 2024. The control group included placebo. The efficacy indicators were change in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL) from baseline until the time of efficacy observation. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 14 and RevMan 5.4. The purpose of data processing, including generating network evidence plots, surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) ranking, league plots, and funnel plots, is to visually summarize and evaluate the relative effectiveness and safety and potential publication bias of multiple interventions. Mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) as effect sizes to analyze continuous variables. RESULTS: This study encompassed six RCTs involving 2,193 patients. Semorinemab were more effective than placebo in MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores (MDs ranging between 0.52 and 3.21; MDs ranging between 0.17 and 3.30). Placebo showed relatively good efficacy according to SUCRA ranking on change in CDR-SB and ADCS-ADL scores (75.7 and 79.5%). Tilavonemab and Semorinemab exhibited efficacy similar to that of a placebo in the analysis of the two indicators. Tilavonemab showed a lower incidence of AE, SAE, fall, and urinary tract infections than placebo, and the differences were statistically significant. Most safety analysis results showed no statistical difference. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that anti-tau protein monoclonal antibodies, such as Semorinemab and Tilavonemab, showed promise in terms of efficacy and safety for managing AD.

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with cognitive decline and changes in brain structure. However, their associations remain unclear, particularly the selective vulnerability characteristics that make some brain regions more vulnerable. METHODS: We investigated the baseline association between estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) and cognitive function in 15,897 individuals from the CARTaGENE cohort. We performed vertex-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses between eGFR and longitudinal cortical thickness in the 1397 participants who underwent brain MRI after 6 years. Imaging transcriptomics was used to characterize the gene expression and neurodegenerative features associated with this association. RESULTS: Lower eGFR correlated with reduced cognitive performance and brain structure. Brain regions associated with eGFR were enriched for mitochondrial and inflammatory-related genes. These associations occurred independently from age, sex, education, and body mass index (BMI), Framingham risk score, and white matter lesion volume. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the link between reduced eGFR, cognitive impairment, and brain structure, revealing some of the kidney-brain axis mechanisms.

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The potential therapeutic role of nicotine in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains controversial, particularly regarding its age-dependent effects and underlying mechanisms. METHODS: This study investigated the impact of chronic nicotine administration on cognitive function and molecular pathways in Presenilin 1/2 double knockout (DKO) mice, an amyloid-\u03b2: (A\u03b2:)- independent model of AD. Three-month-old and eight-month-old DKO and wild-type (WT) mice received oral nicotine treatment (100 \u03bcg/ml) for three months. Behavioral assessments revealed that while the 6-month-old cohort showed no significant differences between nicotine-treated and control groups regardless of genotype, nicotine improved contextual fear memory in 11-month- old DKO mice but impaired nest-building ability and cued fear memory in age-matched WT controls. Transcriptome analysis of the prefrontal cortex identified distinct molecular responses to nicotine between genotypes. RESULTS: In DKO mice, nicotine modulated neuropeptide signaling and reduced astrocyte activation, while in WT mice, it disrupted cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and neuroactive ligand- receptor interaction pathways. Western blot analysis revealed that nicotine treatment significantly reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) expression in 11-month-old DKO mice, which was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry showing decreased astrocyte activation in multiple brain regions CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that nicotine's effects on cognition and molecular pathways are both age- and genotype-dependent, suggesting its therapeutic potential may be limited to specific stages of neurodegeneration while potentially having adverse effects in healthy aging brains.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: For over a decade, AMPA receptor allosteric potentiators (AMPAkines) have shown significant effectiveness in multiple preclinical studies related to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders underpinned by deficient excitatory synaptic activity. Despite promising preclinical evidence, the clinical translation of AMPAkines has been slow due to the propensity of some of these compounds to produce seizures at or around therapeutic doses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The preclinical activity of the AMPAkine CX1837 is disclosed in the current work. RESULTS: CX1837 enhanced synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices in vitro and dose-dependently enhanced long-term potentiation, which is believed to control memory consolidation. CX1837 boosted performance in cognition tests, such as the novel object recognition test and the win-shift radial arm maze. CX1837 also increased attentional functioning in the 5-choice serial reaction time task in rats. CX1837 produced positive preclinical effects at 0.01-1.0 mg/kg dose and elicited epileptic effects at 10 mg/kg dose. DISCUSSION: CX1837 has one of the largest safety margins to date in preclinical studies. Low doses of CX1837, which produce acute increases in cognition, may potentially increase neurotrophins when given chronically. This could slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease and reverse deficits secondary to ischemic stroke. CONCLUSION: Together, our findings highlight CX1837 as a potential candidate for clinical development in order to treat multiple neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of cognitive decline, which leads to dementia and poses significant challenges for its therapy. The reason is primarily the ineffective available treatments targeting the underlying pathology of AD. It is a neurodegenerative disease that is mainly characterised by the various molecular pathways contributing to its complex pathology, including extracellular amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. One of the crucial features is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which is facilitated by microtubule affinity-regulating kinase-4 (MARK-4). The kinase plays a crucial role in the disease development by modifying microtubule integrity, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. MARK-4 is thus a druggable target and has a pivotal role in AD. Amongst MARK-4 inhibitors, 16 compounds demonstrate significant capacity in molecular docking studies, showing high binding affinity to MARK-4 and promising potential for tau inhibition. Further, in-vitro investigations provide evidence of their neuroprotective properties. The present review mainly focuses on the role of MARK-4 and its potential inhibitors used in treating AD, which have been thoroughly investigated in silico and in vitro..",

Building on this opportunity, previous research has used smartphone calendar applications to cue prospective memory in patients with AD. However, in these studies, the calendar has been programmed to send cues only about the time of prospective events. METHODS: We investigated the benefits of the smartphone calendar applications sending notifications about both the time and location of the prospective events. We recruited two groups. In the first group (time-and-location-cued group), we configured smartphone-based calendars to send notifications about the time and location of prospective events, while in the second group (time-cued group), we configured smartphone-based calendars to send notifications only about the time of prospective events. In both groups, we invited patients to attend three prospective events per week during a three-week period. RESULTS: The results demonstrated fewer omissions in the time- and location-cued group than in the time-cued group. CONCLUSION: Providing patients with AD with several contextual cues through smartphone-based calendars may result in better prospective performance than providing them with only one contextual cue.",

Research has identified \u03b2-Secretase (BACE1) as a promising therapeutic target for the management of AD. BACE1 is involved in the rate-limiting step and produces toxic amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides that lead to deposits in the form of amyloid plaques extracellularly, resulting in AD. METHOD: In this connection, 60 small peptides were evaluated for their in-silico studies to predict the bonding orientation with BACE1. Next, 5 peptides (12, 20, 21, 51, and 52) were selected based on high scoring of Vander Waal interactions with the catalytic site of the enzyme. RESULTS: The identified hit peptides were synthesized using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS), and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) elucidated their structures and 1 1 HNMR spectroscopy. According to their In-vitro BACE1 inhibitory study, peptides 21 having high Vander Waal forces showed significant BACE1 inhibition with IC50 = 4.64 \u00b1 0.1\u03bcM). Moreover, the kinetic study revealed that peptide 21 is a mixed-type inhibitor and can interact at the active site and the allosteric site of BACE1. CONCLUSION: According to the cytotoxicity study, peptide 21 was found to be noncytotoxic at 4.64 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM. The forthcoming target of this study is to evaluate further the effect of peptide 21 in an in-vivo mice model.",

        "AbstractText": "Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the alteration/aggregation of TAU protein. One of the main challenges of these diseases is that they have neither biomarkers nor pharmacological targets to stop the neurodegenerative process. Apart from the neurodegenerative process, tauopathies are also characterized by a chronic low-grade neuroinflammation process, where the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) protein plays an essential role. Our research aimed to explore the role of RIPK1 in various tauopathies. We examined mouse models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as well as brain tissue samples from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a primary form of 4R tauopathy, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is considered a secondary tauopathy. Our findings show elevated levels of RIPK1 mRNA levels across various forms of tauopathies, in both mouse models and human tissue samples associated with primary and secondary TAU-related disorders. Furthermore, we investigated the potential of using a RIPK1 inhibitor, known as GSK2982772, in a mouse model as a novel treatment strategy for FTD. The data showed that GSK2982772 treatment effectively reduced the reactive astrocyte response triggered by TAUP301L overexpression. However, this RIPK1 inhibitor failed to protect against the neurodegeneration caused by elevated TAUP301L levels in the hippocampal region. These results suggest that although inhibiting RIPK1 activity may help reduce TAU-related astrogliosis in the brain, the complexity of the inflammatory pathways involved could explain the absence of neuroprotective effects against TAU-induced neurodegeneration.",

The potential of alkaloids derived from the genus Erythrina as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors is being investigated to enhance acetylcholine levels in the brain, which is crucial for the treatment of AD. The objective of this study is to identify Erythrina alkaloids with strong inhibitory capacity against AChE and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi-step computational approach was employed, beginning with the virtual screening of 143 Erythrina alkaloid structures using molecular docking against the human AChE crystal structure. The binding affinities were compared with the known AChE inhibitor, galantamine. The top alkaloid, 8-oxoerymelanthine (128), was subjected to further analysis through molecular dynamics simulations, with the objective of evaluating its stability and interactions. In silico ADMET predictions were conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic properties. The applicability of Lipinski's Rule of Five was applied to evaluate oral drug-likeness. RESULTS: 8-Oxoerymelanthine (128) exhibited the highest binding affinity and remarkable stability in molecular dynamics simulations. The toxicity predictions indicated a low risk of mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity. Pharmacokinetic assessments indicated good absorption, moderate blood-brain barrier penetration, and favorable metabolic and excretion profiles, supporting its potential as an orally active drug candidate. CONCLUSION: 8-Oxoerythmelanthine (128) exhibits strong potential as an AChE inhibitor with a favorable balance of efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties.

Currently available AD drugs are associated with side effects and there is a need to develop natural drugs from plants. Aquilaria is as an endangered medicinal plant genus (commonly called agarwood plants) and various products of Aquilaria plant spp. including resinous heartwood, leaves, bark, and stem have been widely used in various traditional medicine systems. Research on agarwood plants is sparse and only a few previous studies demonstrated their neuroprotective properties in vitro. Owing to the presence of a plethora of secondary metabolites in agarwood plants, it is imperative not only to protect these plants but also evaluate the bioactivity of agarwood phytochemicals. METHODS: This study used Molsoft tools to predict the physicochemical properties of agarwood ligands, including the number of H-bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, lipophilicity, solubility, and the molecular polar surface area and volume of agarwood ligands. Additionally, ADMET (absorption, digestion, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties were predicted using ADMETlab 2.0. Computational methods such as AutoDock Vina and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were employed for the docking of 41 selected agarwood compounds with AD-related molecular targets. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: According to docking data, three compounds aquilarisin (ASN), aquilarisinin (ANN), aquilarixanthone (AXN) showed highest binding affinity to selected AD targets compared to their known inhibitors. MD simulation studies revealed that, selected agarwood compounds' protein-ligand complexes showed remarkable structural stability throughout 100ns simulation. The agarwood chemicals aquilarisin, aquilarisinin, aquilarixanthone, pillion (PLN), and agarotetrol (AGT) are consequently suggested as some of the found hits against AD targets, however, additional experimental validation is required to establish their effectiveness.",

Here, we introduced TEC-LncMir, a novel approach for predicting lncRNA-miRNA interaction using Transformer Encoder and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). TEC-LncMir treats lncRNA and miRNA sequences as natural languages, encodes them using the Transformer Encoder, and combines representations of a pair of microRNA and lncRNA into a contact tensor (a three-dimensional array). Afterward, TEC-LncMir treats the contact tensor as a multi-channel image, utilizes a four-layer CNN to extract the contact tensor's features, and then uses these features to predict the interaction between the pair of lncRNA and miRNA. We applied a series of comparative experiments to demonstrate that TEC-LncMir significantly improves lncRNA-miRNA interaction prediction, compared with existing state-of-the-art models. We also trained TEC-LncMir utilizing a large training dataset, and as expected, TEC-LncMir achieves unprecedented performance. Moreover, we integrated miRanda into TEC-LncMir to show the secondary structures of high-confidence interactions. Finally, we utilized TEC-LncMir to identify microRNAs interacting with lncRNA NEAT1, where NEAT1 performs as a competitive endogenous RNA of the microRNAs' targets (mRNAs) in brain cells. We also demonstrated the regulatory mechanism of NEAT1 in Alzheimer's disease via transcriptome analysis and sequence alignment analysis. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectivity of TEC-LncMir, suggest a potential regulation of miRNAs by NEAT1 in Alzheimer's disease, and take a significant step forward in lncRNA-miRNA interaction prediction.",

Here, we use a 7T MRI approach, Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST), to measure bilateral hippocampal Glu in healthy old (HOA) and young (HYA) adults. METHODS: Bilateral hippocampal GluCEST data was acquired from 27 HOA and 22 HYA using 7T MRI. GluCEST differences by age and hemisphere were tested with a linear mixed model. GluCEST asymmetry index was also evaluated by age. Exploratory analyses examined associations between hippocampal GluCEST, age group, and scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Cognitive Complaints Index (CCI). RESULTS: GluCEST levels showed an age group and hemisphere interaction. In HOA, GluCEST was higher in left than right hippocampus, but in HYA, GluCEST level was equivalent across hemispheres. HOA had lower GluCEST than HYA in the right hippocampus. GluCEST asymmetry index confirmed significant left asymmetry in HOA. Lower GluCEST levels in HOA were associated with subjective cognitive complaints as measured by the CCI. DISCUSSION: Hippocampal GluCEST provides insight into age-related neural changes, with lower GluCEST in the right hippocampus in older adults.

        "ArticleTitle": "The role of the neuregulin 1-ErbB4 signaling pathway in neurological disorders.",
        "AbstractText": "The neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (ErbB4) signaling pathway is expressed in multiple systems of the body and has been shown to be involved in various life activities, with upregulation observed in some pathological processes. ErbB4 is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, which, when activated by its ligand, NRG1, forms the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway. Initially, this pathway garnered attention due to its high expression and relevance in cardiovascular system development and related diseases. However, little was known about its role in other systems in the past. In recent years, with the advancement of research in neuroscience, the role of the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway in the nervous system has gradually been recognized. Increasing evidence suggests that upon activation, the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in various neuronal activities such as proliferation, development, and differentiation, and is closely associated with a variety of physiological and pathological processes including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, depression, epilepsy, among others. Moreover, based on extensive research data, mature clinical diagnostic and therapeutic approaches targeting the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway have been proven effective. Additionally, a detailed information on the risk score based on the pathway's activity is included, highlighting its potential in predicting and managing neurological disorders. Therefore, it can be considered that the role and mechanism of the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway in neurological diseases are valuable research topics in the field of neuroscience. This article reviews recent research on the role of the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway in the nervous system.",

        "AbstractText": "To explore the neuroprotective effects of Sinapic Acid (SA) in APP/PS1 mouse model and amyloid beta-peptide (A\u03b2)-induced neuronal cell apoptosis using PC12 cells of Alzheimer's disease. In vivo, the Morris water maze (MWM) test assessed learning and memory abilities, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test and immunohistochemistry were conducted to plaque deposition and content of A\u03b2. Western blotting was performed to p-P13K, P13K, p-Akt, Akt, p-GSK3\u03b2 and GSK3\u03b2 expression of the hippocampus in mice, respectively. In vitro, the viability of the cells, the apoptosis of the cells and the level of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, p-P13K, P13K, p-Akt, Akt, p-GSK3\u03b2 and GSK3\u03b2 expression of PC12 cells were examined by CCK-8 assay, Hoechst 33342 and Calcein/propidium iodide (PI) staining, flow cytometry and Western blotting, respectively. Our results indicated SA could improve learning and memory abilities and decrease plaque deposition and content of A\u03b2 of the hippocampus in mice. Furthermore, SA increased cell viability and lessened cell apoptosis by increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, lessening protein levels of Caspase-3 in PC12 cells. SA upregulated the phosphorylation expression level of PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2 in APP/PS1 mice and PC12 cells. Our research showed that SA's neuroprotective effect reduced A\u03b2 deposition and cell apoptosis by activating the PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2 pathway.",

        "AbstractText": "Chemokine receptors CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5 are G protein-coupled receptors implicated in diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, asthma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and macular degeneration. Recently, CCR3 and CCR4 have emerged as potential stroke targets. Although only the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc is US Food and Drug Administration-approved (for HIV), we curated data on CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5 antagonists from ChEMBL to develop and validate machine learning models. The top 5-fold cross-validation statistics for these models were high for both classification and regression models for CCR3 (receiver operating characteristic [ROC], 0.94; R2\u00a0= 0.8), CCR4 (ROC, 0.98; R2\u00a0= 0.57), and CCR5 (ROC, 0.96; R2\u00a0= 0.78). The models for CCR3/4 were used to screen a small library of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and 17 were initially tested in\u00a0vitro against both CCR3/4 receptors. A promising compound lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was identified as an antagonist for CCR3 (IC50, 0.7 \u03bcM) and CCR4 (IC50, 1.8\u00a0\u03bcM). Additional testing also identified it as an CCR5 antagonist (IC50, 0.9 \u03bcM), and it showed moderate in\u00a0vitro HIV I inhibition. We demonstrated how machine learning can be used to identify molecules for repurposing as antagonists for G protein-coupled receptors such as CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5. Lapatinib may represent a new orally available chemical probe for these 3 receptors, and it provides a starting point for further chemical optimization for multiple diseases impacting human health. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We describe the building of machine learning models for the chemokine receptors CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5 trained on data from the ChEMBL database. Using these models, we identified lapatinib as a potent inhibitor of CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5. Our study illustrates the potential of machine learning in identifying molecules for repurposing as antagonists for G protein-coupled receptors, including CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5, which have various therapeutic applications.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Researchers have shown that music-evoked autobiographical memories (MEAMs) can stimulate long-term memory mechanisms while requiring little retrieval effort and may therefore be used in promising non-pharmacological interventions to mitigate memory deficits. Despite an increasing number of studies on MEAMs, few researchers have explored how MEAMs are bound in the brain. METHODS: In the current study activation indexed by fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) during familiar and unfamiliar MEAM retrieval was compared in a sample of 24 healthy older adults. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the impact of age-related gray matter volume (GMV) reduction in key regions associated with MEAM-related activation. In addition to a T1 structural scan, neuroimaging data were collected while participants listened to familiar music (MEAM retrieval) versus unfamiliar music. RESULTS: When listening to familiar compared to unfamiliar music, greater fALFF activation patterns were observed in the right parahippocampal gyrus, controlling for age and GMV. The current findings for the familiar (MEAM) condition have implications for cognitive aging as persons experiencing age-related memory decline are particularly susceptible to volumetric reduction in the parahippocampal cortex. Post-hoc analyses to explore correlations between brain activity and the content of MEAMs were performed using the text analysis program Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that MEAM-related activation of the parahippocampal cortex is evident in normative older adults. However, it is yet to be determined whether such brain states are attainable in older adult populations diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and/or prodromal Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Single-nucleotide variants near TMEM106B associate with the risk of frontotemporal lobar dementia with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and Alzheimer disease (AD) in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), but the causal variant at this locus remains unclear. Here, we asked whether a novel structural variant on TMEM106B is the causal variant. METHODS: An exploratory analysis identified structural variants on neurodegeneration-related genes. Subsequent analyses focused on an Alu element insertion on the 3'UTR of TMEM106B. This study included data from longitudinal aging and neurogenerative disease cohorts at Stanford University, case-control cohorts in the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), and expression and proteomics data from Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL). Four hundred thirty-two individuals from 2 Stanford aging cohorts were whole-genome long-read and short-read sequenced. A total of 16,906 samples from ADSP were short-read sequenced. Genotypes, transcriptomics, and proteomics data were available in 1,979 participants from an aging and dementia cohort at WUSTL. Selection criteria were specific to each cohort. In primary analyses, the linkage disequilibrium between the TMEM106B locus variants in the FTLD-TDP GWAS and the 3'UTR insertion was estimated. We then estimated linkage by ancestry in the ADSP and evaluated the effect of the TMEM106B lead variant on mRNA and protein levels. RESULTS: The primary analysis included 432 participants (52.5% female, age range 45-92 years). We identified a 316 bp Alu insertion overlapping the TMEM106B 3'UTR tightly linked with top GWAS variants rs3173615(C) and rs1990622(A). In ADSP European ancestry participants, this insertion is in equivalent linkage with rs1990622(A) (R2 = 0.962, D' = 0.998) and rs3173615(C) (R2 = 0.960, D' = 0.996). In African ancestry participants, the insertion is in stronger linkage with rs1990622(A) (R2 = 0.992, D' = 0.998) than with rs3173615(C) (R2 = 0.811, D' = 0.994). In public data sets, rs1990622 was consistently associated with TMEM106B protein levels but not with mRNA expression. In the WUSTL data set, rs1990622 is associated with TMEM106B protein levels in plasma and CSF, but not with TMEM106B mRNA expression. DISCUSSION: We identified a novel Alu element insertion in the 3'UTR of TMEM106B in tight linkage with the lead FTLD-TDP risk variant. The lead variant is associated with TMEM106B protein levels, but not expression. The 3'UTR insertion is a lead candidate for the causal variant at this complex locus, pending confirmation with functional studies.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and the sixth most common cause of death in the US according to the Alzheimer's Association. As regards, to date, no effective treatments are available because of the multifactorial nature of the disease, therefore, a large body of recent research has been allocated to the design and development of multi-target-directed ligands that can become effective drug candidates. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: A novel series of benzamide derivatives (5a-5l) containing piperidine core were synthesized in the current work. After identification of the chemical structures of the members of this series using 1H NMR, IR, and MS spectra, their anti-acetylcholinesterase activity was assessed by the Ellman\u1fbds test. Docking studies were also performed to investigate the binding mode and determine the interacting amino acids with the corresponding ligands. Finally, the pharmacokinetic (ADME parameters) of the most potent derivative (5d) was predicted and compared with donepezil. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Compound 5d possessing the fluorine atom substitution at position ortho was the most active compound in these series (IC50 = 13 \u00b1 2.1 nM). This compound demonstrated superior activity than the reference drug donepezil (IC50 = 0.6 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b5M). Molecular docking showed a significant hydrogen bonding of the carbonyl group of compounds 5d with tyrosine 121 into the active site of acetylcholinesterase. Fortunately, this compound showed better promising ADME properties than donepezil. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION: The benzamide derivatives introduced in this paper could be proposed as potential anti-acetylcholinesterase.",

        "AbstractText": "Despite the recent therapeutic advances in neurological disorders, curative therapy remains a serious challenge in many cases. Even though recent years have witnessed the development of gene therapy from among the different therapeutic approaches affecting pathophysiological mechanisms, intriguing aspects exist regarding the effectiveness, safety, and mechanism of action of gene therapies. Micro ribonucleic acid (microRNA-miRNA), as a fundamental gene regulator, regulates messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) by directly binding through the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). MicroRNA-219 is a specific brain-enriched miRNA associated with neurodevelopmental disorders that play crucial roles in the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitorcells, promotion of oligodendrocyte maturation, remyelination, and cognitive functions to the extent that it can be considered a potential therapeutic option for demyelination in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury and reverse chronic inflammation pains. Additionally, miR-219 regulates the circadian clock, influencing the duration of the circadian clock period. This regulation can impact mood stability and is associated with phase fluctuations in bipolar patients. Furthermore, miR-219 also plays a role in modulating tau toxicity, which is relevant to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Finally, it reportedly has protective effects against seizures and Parkinson's disease, as well as neoplasms, by inhibiting proliferation, suppressing invasion, and inducing cell death in tumor cells. Exploring the miR-219 molecular pathways and their therapeutic effects on central nervous system disorders and the mechanisms involved, the present review study aims to illustrate how this information may change the future of gene therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The demand for more accurate and early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) has increased after disease-modifying drugs were launched. Among these needs, there is a requirement for tools that can easily assess the ability to recall memories, which changes early in the disease. OBJECTIVES: We established Self Assessment Memory Scale (SAMS) method before, which includes 8-picture recall test and 16-word recognition test. We adopted this method to software that can be operated on a tablet computer so that participants can perform the method independently. The purpose of this study was to validate this method. DESIGN: Cross sectional research. SETTING: Some of the participants were recruited from hospitals for patients diagnosed with AD or MCI. The others were recruited from three regional cohorts of healthy older adults. PARTICIPANTS: The total number of participants was 304 (20 of whom had AD or MCI), and the mean age was 71.2\u202fyears. 64% of the participants were women. MEASUREMENTS: We used the logical memory subtest of the WMS-R as the standard for memory evaluation and assessed the relationship between this score and the SAMS score calculated by the software. RESULTS: The 2nd SAMS score were higher than the 1st SAMS score in some participants, on the other hand, the intraclass correlation coefficient was good. Since the number of false recognition in the 16-word recognition test was higher in participants with lower LM II scores, we developed a new score to reflect the ratio of false recognition, SAMS-R, and we observed it has good correlation with LM II. The mean SAMS-R score decreased gradually after the age of 65\u202fyears, indicating that age-related changes in memory recall can be detected. The ROC curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the detectability to determine whether if the WMS-R LM II score is above or below 10, showing that the AUC was greater than 0.9. CONCLUSION: SAMS-R, which can be performed on a tablet literally by himself/herself independently, shows a high correlation with the WMS-R Logical Memory II score, and has the advantage of being performed in a short time without the need for a clinical psychologist or other personnel.",

        "AbstractText": "Anomalous chromosomes are the cause of genetic diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, epilepsy, and autism. Karyotype analysis is the standard procedure for diagnosing genetic disorders. Identifying anomalies is often costly, time-consuming, heavily reliant on expert interpretation, and requires considerable manual effort. Efforts are being made to automate karyogram analysis. However, the unavailability of large datasets, particularly those including samples with chromosomal abnormalities, presents a significant challenge. The development of automated models requires extensive labeled and incredibly abnormal data to accurately identify and analyze abnormalities, which are difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities. Although the deep learning-based architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in medical image anomaly detection, it cannot be generalized well because of the lack of anomalous datasets. This study introduces a novel hybrid approach that combines unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to overcome the challenges of limited labeled data and scalability in chromosomal analysis. An Autoencoder-based system is initially trained with unlabeled data to identify chromosome patterns. It is fine-tuned on labeled data, followed by a classification step using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A unique dataset of 234,259 chromosome images, including the training, validation, and test sets, was used. Marking a significant achievement in the scale of chromosomal analysis. The proposed hybrid system accurately detects structural anomalies in individual chromosome images, achieving 99.3% accuracy in classifying normal and abnormal chromosomes. We also used a structural similarity index measure and template matching to identify the part of the abnormal chromosome that differed from the normal one. This automated model has the potential to significantly contribute to the early detection and diagnosis of chromosome-related disorders that affect both genetic health and neurological behavior.",

Despite the significant research efforts, the ability to completely prevent or effectively treat AD and its related dementias remains limited. Protein kinases are integral to AD pathology and represent promising targets for therapeutic intervention. METHODS: A series of pyrimidine-based compounds 4-(4-(arylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)-6-(thiophen-3-yl)pyrimidine derivatives (8-14) were synthesized and characterised. ATPase inhibition was carried out against the MARK4 enzyme. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at 500\u00a0ns was carried out against MARK4 (PDB: 5ES1). The drug-likeness feature and toxicity of the molecules were evaluated using QikProp and other tools. RESULTS: Compounds were synthesized following a multi-step approach and characterized using multi-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H/13C-NMR) and mass spectrometry. ATPase inhibition assay of the compounds against MARK4 showed an IC50 value in the micromolar (\u03bcM) range. The results of the docking studies were consistent with the in-vitro experiments and identified (9) and (14) as the candidates with the highest affinity towards MARK4. MD simulation further supported these results, showing that the binding of ligands stabilises the target protein.

        "ArticleTitle": "Therapeutic targeting of obesity-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.",
        "AbstractText": "Obesity is a major modifiable risk factor leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Excessive fat storage in obesity promotes the progressive infiltration of immune cells into adipose tissue, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory factors such as cytokines and adipokines. These inflammatory mediators circulate through the bloodstream, propagating inflammation both in the periphery and in the central nervous system. Gut dysbiosis, which results in a leaky intestinal barrier, exacerbates inflammation and plays a significant role in linking obesity to the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration through the gut-brain/gut-brain-liver axis. Inflammatory states within the brain can lead to insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, autolysosomal dysfunction, and increased oxidative stress. These disruptions impair normal neuronal function and subsequently lead to cognitive decline and motor deficits, similar to the pathologies observed in major neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Understanding the underlying disease mechanisms is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to address defects in these inflammatory and metabolic pathways. In this review, we summarize and provide insights into different therapeutic strategies, including methods to alter gut dysbiosis, lifestyle changes, dietary supplementation, as well as pharmacological agents derived from natural sources, that target obesity-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.",

Recently, RORB has also emerged as a novel potential gene involved in generalized epilepsy and absence seizures. However, due to the complexity of RORB gene function, reports on pathogenic variations of RORB genes are still lacking. In this study, we present a case of a 5-year-old epilepsy patient.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and cost-effective technique commonly used in the study of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the specific alterations in EEG biomarkers associated with AD remain unclear when using a limited number of electrodes. METHODS: We studied pathological characteristics of AD using low-density EEG data collected from 26 AD and 29 healthy controls (HC) during both eye closed (EC) and eye opened (EO) resting conditions. The analysis including power spectrum, phase lock value (PLV), and weighted lag phase index (wPLI) and power-to-power frequency coupling (theta/beta) analysis were applied to extract features in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. RESULTS: During the EC condition, the AD group exhibited decreased alpha power compared to HC. Additionally, both analysis of PLV and wPLI in the theta band indicated that the alterations in the AD brain network predominantly involved in the frontal region with the opposite changes. Moreover, the AD group had increased frequency coupling in the frontal and central regions. Surprisingly, no group difference was found in the EO condition. Notably, decreased theta band functional connectivity within the fronto-central lobe and increased frequency coupling in frontal region were found in AD group from EC to EO. More importantly, the combination of EC and EO quantitative EEG features improved the inter-group classification accuracy when using support vector machine (SVM) in older adults with AD. These findings highlight the complementary nature of EC and EO conditions in assessing and differentiating AD cohorts. CONCLUSION: Our results underscore the potential of utilizing low-density EEG data from resting-state paradigms, combined with machine learning techniques, to improve the identification and classification of AD.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Repurposing FDA-Approved Drugs Against Potential Drug Targets Involved in Brain Inflammation Contributing to Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that continues to have a rising number of cases. While extensive research has been conducted in the last few decades, only a few drugs have been approved by the FDA for treatment, and even fewer aim to be curative rather than manage symptoms. There remains an urgent need for understanding disease pathogenesis, as well as identifying new targets for further drug discovery. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to stem from a build-up of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques as well as tangles of tau proteins. Furthermore, inflammation in the brain is known to arise from the degeneration of tissue and the build-up of insoluble material. Therefore, there is a potential link between the pathology of AD and inflammation in the brain, especially as the disease progresses to later stages where neuronal death and degeneration levels are higher. Proteins that are relevant to both brain inflammation and AD thus make ideal potential targets for therapeutics; however, the proteins need to be evaluated to determine which targets would be ideal for potential drug therapeutic treatments, or 'druggable'. Druggability analysis was conducted using two structure-based methods (i.e., Drug-Like Density analysis and SiteMap), as well as a sequence-based approach, SPIDER. The most druggable targets were then evaluated using single-nuclei sequencing data for their clinical relevance to inflammation in AD. For each of the top five targets, small molecule docking was used to evaluate which FDA approved drugs were able to bind with the chosen proteins. The top targets included DRD2 (inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity), C9 (binds with C5B8 to form the membrane attack complex), C4b (binds with C2a to form C3 convertase), C5AR1 (GPCR that binds C5a), and GABA-A-R (GPCR involved in inhibiting neurotransmission). Each target had multiple potential inhibitors from the FDA-approved drug list with decent binding infinities. Among these inhibitors, two drugs were found as top inhibitors for more than one protein target. They are C15H14N2O2 and v316 (Paracetamol), used to treat pain/inflammation originally for cataracts and relieve headaches/fever, respectively. These results provide the groundwork for further experimental investigation or clinical trials.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Lipid mediators in post-mortem brain samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review.",
        "AbstractText": "A proposed contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is the induction of neuroinflammation due to tau and beta-amyloid protein accumulation causing neuronal injury and dysfunction. Dysregulation of lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to this inflammatory response in the brain of patients with AD, yet the literature has not yet been systematically reviewed. A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Embase and PsychINFO for articles published up to April 22, 2024. Papers were included if they measured levels of lipid mediators and/or enzymes involved in their production in post-mortem brain samples from patients with AD and control without neurological disease. A total of 50 relevant studies were identified. Despite heterogeneity in the results, pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, including 5-, 11-, 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid oxylipins and prostaglandin D2, were significantly higher, while anti-inflammatory lipoxin A4 and DHA-derived docosanoids were significantly lower in brains of patients with AD compared to control (16 studies). Thirty-seven articles reported on enzymes, with 32 reporting values for enzyme level changes between AD and controls. Among the 32 articles, the majority reported on levels of cyclooxygenase (COX) (18/32), with fewer studies reporting on phospholipase (8/32), lipoxygenase (LOX) (4/32) and prostaglandin E synthase (4/32). Enzyme levels also exhibited variability in the literature, with a trend towards elevated expression of enzymes involved in the pro-inflammatory response, including COX and LOX enzymes. Overall, these results are consistent with the involvement of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of AD measured by lipid mediators. However, the specific contribution of each lipid metabolite and enzymes to either the progression or persistence of AD remains unclear, and more research is required.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder that causes incurable and irreversible neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction. The progress of this disease is gradual and depending on the stage of its detection, only its progression can be treated, reducing the most aggressive symptoms and the speed of its neurodegenerative progress. This article proposes an early detection model for the diagnosis of AD by performing analyses in Alzheimer's progression patient datasets, provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including only neuropsychological assessments and making use of feature selection techniques and machine learning models. The focus of this research is to build an ensemble machine learning model capable of early detection of a patient with Alzheimer's or a cognitive state that leads to it, based on their results in neuropsychological assessments identified as highly relevant for the detection of Alzheimer's. The proposed approach for the detection of AD is presented with the inclusion of the feature selection technique recursive feature elimination (RFE) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the ensemble model consists of logistic regression (LR), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and nearest centroid (Nearcent). The datasets downloaded from ADNI were divided into 13 subsets including: cognitively normal (CN) vs subjective memory concern (SMC), CN vs early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), CN vs late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), CN vs AD, SMC vs EMCI, SMC vs LMCI, SMC vs AD, EMCI vs LMCI, EMCI vs AD, LMCI vs AD, MCI vs AD, CN vs AD and CN vs MCI. From all the feature results, a custom model was created using RFE, AIC and testing each model. This work presents a customized model for a backend platform to perform one-versus-all analysis and provide a basis for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's at its current stage.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a condition with a complex pathogenesis, sometimes hereditary, characterized by the loss of neurons and synapses, along with the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Early detection, particularly among individuals at high risk, is critical for effective treatment or prevention, yet remains challenging due to data variability and incompleteness. Most current research relies on single data modalities, potentially limiting comprehensive staging of AD. This study addresses this gap by integrating multimodal data-including clinical and genetic information-using deep learning (DL) models, with a specific focus on random vector functional link (RVFL) networks, to enhance early detection of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Our findings demonstrate that ensemble deep RVFL (edRVFL) models, when combined with effective data imputation techniques such as Winsorized-mean (Wmean), achieve superior performance in detecting early stages of AD. Notably, the edRVFL model achieved an accuracy of 98.8%, precision of 98.3%, recall of 98.4%, and F1-score of 98.2%, outperforming traditional machine learning models like support vector machines, random forests, and decision trees. This underscores the importance of integrating advanced imputation strategies and deep learning techniques in AD diagnosis.",

Though the most common diagnosis is corticobasal degeneration (CBD), the spectrum of underlying pathologies expands beyond CBD and can overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases and even the neuroimmunology field. We will review possible clinical presentations and cues that can point towards the etiology. We will also discuss the most recent available biomarkers to facilitate a more accurate diagnosis. Additionally, we will examine current and future potential therapeutic options. RECENT FINDINGS: The range of available fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers is increasing and some are already being used in clinical practice. While the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is largely aimed at managing symptoms, early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for initiating early management and enrollment in clinical trials. The recent approval of a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised hopes for the development of more therapeutic options for other proteinopathies. Several candidates are currently being studied in clinical trial pipelines, particularly those targeting tau pathology.

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common form of focal epilepsy, often associated with cognitive impairments, particularly in memory functions, and depression. Sex and APOE \u03b54 genotype play a crucial role in modulating cognitive outcomes and depression in various neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease. However, the combined effects of APOE genotype and sex on cognitive performance and depression in temporal lobe epilepsy have not been previously investigated. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to (i) identify impaired cognitive performance and clinically relevant depression; (ii) explore the interaction between sex and APOE \u03b54 genotype on cognitive performance and depression in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: We used a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to assess domains such as learning and memory, attention, executive functions, language, and visuo-spatial constructional skills and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. We also performed APOE genotyping to assess its role in the study. The final sample was composed by fifty-four patients (53.7% female). Cognitive performance and depression were analyzed using normative cut-off scores. To examine the main effects and interactions of sex and APOE \u03b54 carrier status on neuropsychological test scores and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, we also conducted a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Female APOE \u03b54 carriers compared to normative cut-offs, exhibited poor performance on multiple test scores, including the MMSE, The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (immediate and delayed recall), The Corsi Block-Tapping Task, The Verbal Fluency Test, The Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and The Pentagon-copying Test. Males showed impairment only in visuo-spatial short-term memory. ANOVA analysis revealed significant main effects of APOE \u03b54 status and sex on the MMSE, The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, The Verbal Fluency, The Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and The Pentagon-copying Test scores. Specifically, female APOE \u03b54 carriers performed consistently worse than other groups on many tasks. For depression, only an effect of sex emerged. Females scored higher besides APOE genotype. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of considering both sex and APOE genotype when assessing cognitive performance in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The significant cognitive deficits we observed among females carrying the APOE \u03b54 allele highlight previously unexplored genetic and sex-related influences on cognition. This has potential implications for personalized therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the need for targeted assessment and intervention.",

This heterogeneity can be studied and disentangled using data-driven clustering techniques. METHODS: We implemented a self-organizing map clustering algorithm on baseline volumetric MRI measures from nine brain regions of interest (ROIs) to cluster 1041 individuals enrolled in the placebo arm of the EXPEDITION3 trial. Volumetric MRI differences were compared among clusters. Demographics as well as baseline and longitudinal cognitive performance metrics were used to evaluate cluster characteristics. RESULTS: Three distinct clusters, with an overall silhouette coefficient of 0.491, were identified based on MRI volumetrics. Cluster 1 (N = 400) had the largest baseline volumetric measures across all ROIs and the best cognitive performance at baseline. Cluster 2 (N = 269) had larger hippocampal and medial temporal lobe volumes, but smaller parietal lobe volumes in comparison with the third cluster (N = 372). Significant between-group mean differences were observed between Clusters 1 and 2 (difference, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.85 to 2.91; P < 0.001), Clusters 1 and 3 (difference, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.44; P < 0.001), but not between Clusters 2 and 3 (difference, 0.45; 95% CI, -0.11 to 1.02; P = 0.146) in ADAS-14. CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric MRI can be used to identify homogenous clusters of amyloid positive individuals with mild dementia. The groups identified differ in baseline and longitudinal characteristics. Cluster 1 shows little ADAS-14 change over the first 40 weeks of study on placebo treatment and may be unsuitable for identifying early benefits of treatment.",

Effective drugs for treatment are lacking, and we struggle to find sensitive markers to track the disease's severity and progression. In this study, our objective was to investigate the levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) in individuals with CMT and to compare them to a control group. Our primary goal is to determine whether these biomarker levels are related to the severity of the disease. METHODS: Initially, 44 patients with CMT and 44 controls participated in this study. CMT diagnosis was approved by genetic testing. Disease severity was assessed through clinical evaluations using the CMT Neuropathy Score version 2 (CMTNSv2). NfL and GFAP concentrations were measured using Single molecule array, while FGF-21 and GDF-15 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: In the group of patients with CMT, the concentrations of GDF15, FGF21, NfL, and GFAP were significantly higher than in the control group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). NfL and GFAP levels were correlated with the CMTNSv2 score (rs\u202f=\u202f0.46, p\u202f=\u202f0.002; rs\u202f=\u202f0.31, p\u202f=\u202f0.04). CONCLUSION: Our study has provided confirmation that plasma concentrations of NfL, GFAP, GDF15, and FGF21 are significantly elevated in patients with CMT compared to controls. Furthermore, NfL and GFAP levels were correlated with the clinical severity of CMT. These findings suggest that NfL and GFAP can be reliable disease indicators in future research.",

METHODS: Data on the incidence rates, DALY rates, and death rates of AD across various geographic populations from 1990 to 2021 were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were employed to forecast the disease burden from 2022 to 2030. RESULTS: The projected global burden of Alzheimer's disease from 2022 to 2030 indicates a decrease in DALYs, with an Estimated Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) of -1.44 (95% CI: -1.45, -1.42). Similarly, death rates and incidence rates also show a decline, with EAPCs of -1.80 (95% CI: -1.83, -1.77) and -1.27 (95% CI: -1.29, -1.26) respectively. Gender-specific analysis reveals that the projected global incidence EAPC from 2022 to 2030 is estimated at -1.73 (95% CI: -1.75, -1.70) for males and -1.03 (95% CI: -1.04, -1.02) for females.

Its high heterogeneity and elevated conversion rate to dementia pose challenges for accurate diagnosis and monitoring, highlighting the urgent need to identify methodologies focused on the early detection and intervention of MCI. Due to their biological characteristics, microRNAs (miRNAs) are potential candidates as non-invasive molecular markers for the identification and assessment of MCI progression. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify the miRNAs commonly deregulated in MCI, focusing on expression profiles in plasma, serum, and extracellular vesicle samples. Our analysis identified eight upregulated miRNAs, including hsa-miR-149-3p, and four downregulated miRNAs, such as Let-7f-5p. Notably, hsa-miR-149-3p emerged as a central node in interaction networks, suggesting its crucial role in regulating cellular processes relevant to MCI. Additionally, pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment in biological processes associated with transcriptional regulation and neurodegeneration. Our results underscore the potential of circulating miRNAs as non-invasive molecular markers for MCI and open the possibility for new methodologies that enable more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Validating the expression of miRNAs such as hsa-miR-149-3p and Let-7f-5p, along with identifying their functional role in the specific context of MCI, is essential to establish their biological relevance. This work contributes to the understanding of the miRNA profile in mild cognitive impairment using easily accessible samples, which could be useful for the development of various strategies aimed at preventing or delaying MCI in individuals at risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.",

Existing methods for diagnosing AD are struggling to detect the condition in its earliest and most treatable stages. One early indicator of AD is a substantial decrease in the brain's glucose metabolism. Metabolomics can detect disturbances in biofluids, which may be advantageous for early detection of some AD-related changes. The study aims to predict brain hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease using metabolomics findings and develop a predictive model based on metabolomic data. METHODS: The data used in this study were acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. We conducted a longitudinal study with three assessment time points to investigate the predictive power of baseline metabolomics for modeling longitudinal fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) trajectory changes in AD patients. A total of 44 participants with AD were included. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) were used for cognitive assessments. A single global brain hypo-metabolism index was used as the outcome variable. RESULTS: Across models, we observed consistent positive relationships between specific cholesterol esters - CE (20:3) (p = 0.005) and CE (18:3) (p = 0.0039) - and FDG-PET metrics, indicating these baseline metabolites may be valuable indicators of future PET score changes. Selected triglycerides like DG-O (16:0-20:4) also showed time-specific positive associations (p = 0.017).

        "AbstractText": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized membranous particles that are secreted by various cell types and play a critical role in intercellular communication. Their unique properties and remarkable ability to deliver bioactive cargo to target cells have made them promising tools in the treatment of various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuropathological hallmarks, such as amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Despite extensive research, no disease-modifying therapy for AD is currently available. However, EVs have emerged as a potential therapeutic agent in AD due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, deliver bioactive cargo, and modulate neuroinflammation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on the role of EVs in AD and discusses their potential as a therapeutic approach. It covers the mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic targets, and challenges and limitations of EV-based therapies for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been demonstrated to have a promising effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is one of the earliest brain regions affected in AD, and changes in its functional connectivity (FC) are reported to underlie disease-associated memory impairment. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of acupuncture on FC with the RSC in patients with AD. METHODS: Demographic data, neuropsychological assessments, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 14\u202fAD patients and 14 normal controls (NCs) matched by age, sex, and educational level at baseline. After the baseline MRI scan, acupuncture stimulation on the Taichong (LIV3) and Hegu (LI4) points was performed for 3\u202fmin. Then, another 10\u202fmin of fMRI data were acquired after the needle was withdrawn. A dataset that included 100 healthy participants was also included to construct a reliable FC map of the RSC. Two sets of regions of interest (ROIs) in the RSC were selected to assess the sustained effect of acupuncture on FC with the RSC in AD patients and NCs. RESULTS: Two sets of RSC ROI-based analyses demonstrated robust positive connectivity with the hippocampus (HPC). Furthermore, multiple brain regions, including the bilateral thalamus, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), bilateral subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG), bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and right precuneus, showed decreased FC with the RSC in the AD group and increased FC with the RSC in the NC group after acupuncture compared to that at baseline. Acupuncture also specifically elicited increased FC between the RSC and the HPC as well as between the RSC and the parahippocampal gyrus in AD patients and decreased FC between the RSC and the visual cortices in NCs. Additionally, diminished FC with the RSC was correlated with neuropsychological scale scores in the AD group before acupuncture treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm and extend previous studies suggesting that acupuncture at Taichong (LIV3) and Hegu (LI4) can exert bidirectional and benign regulatory effects on RSC connectivity in AD patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, accounting for approximately 70% of dementia cases worldwide. Patients gradually exhibit cognitive decline, such as memory loss, aphasia, and changes in personality and behavior. Research has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the onset and progression of AD. Mitochondrial dysfunction primarily leads to increased oxidative stress, imbalances in mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitophagy, and mitochondrial genome abnormalities. These mitochondrial abnormalities are closely associated with amyloid-beta and tau protein pathology, collectively accelerating the neurodegenerative process. This review summarizes the role of mitochondria in the development of AD, the latest research progress, and explores the potential of mitochondria-targeted therapeutic strategies for AD. Targeting mitochondria-related pathways may significantly improve the quality of life for AD patients in the future.",

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the association between CSF sTREM1 levels and longitudinal changes in hippocampal volumes, and to determine if this relationship is moderated by cognitive status. METHODS: We included 576 participants, comprising 152 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 424 cognitively impaired (CI) individuals. In the cross-sectional analyses, Pearson's correlation tests were conducted to examine the relationship between baseline CSF sTREM1 levels and hippocampal volumes in both CU and CI participants. For the longitudinal analyses, a linear mixed-effects model was employed to assess the significance of the three-way interaction between CSF sTREM1 levels, cognitive status, and follow-up time on adjusted hippocampal volume (aHV). Further stratified analyses based on cognitive status were performed to dissect the specific effects within each group. RESULTS: Our findings revealed significantly elevated baseline CSF sTREM1 levels in CI participants compared to CU participants. Cross-sectional analyses demonstrated that CSF sTREM1 levels were negatively associated with hippocampal volumes in both CU and CI participants. In the longitudinal analyses, the three-way interaction between CSF sTREM1 levels, cognitive status, and follow-up time was found to be significant for aHV. Stratified analyses indicated that, in CI participants, higher CSF sTREM1 levels were associated with a more accelerated rate of hippocampal atrophy, whereas no such association was observed in CU participants. CONCLUSION: These results underscore the complex interplay between neuroinflammation, as reflected by CSF sTREM1 levels, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive decline. The data suggest that neuroinflammation may contribute differently to hippocampal atrophy rates in CI versus CU individuals, highlighting the potential for targeted anti-inflammatory interventions in the prevention and treatment of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Altered protein conformation can cause incurable neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations in SERPINI1, the gene encoding neuroserpin, can alter protein conformation resulting in cytotoxic aggregation leading to neuronal death. Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) is a rare autosomal dominant progressive myoclonic epilepsy that progresses to dementia and premature death. We developed HEK293T and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of FENIB, harboring a patient-specific pathogenic SERPINI1 variant or stably overexpressing mutant neuroserpin fused to GFP (MUT NS-GFP). Here, we utilized a personalized adenine base editor (ABE)-mediated approach to correct the pathogenic variant efficiently and precisely to restore neuronal dendritic morphology. ABE-treated MUT NS-GFP cells demonstrated reduced inclusion size and number. Using an inducible MUT NS-GFP neuron system, we identified early prevention of toxic protein expression allowed aggregate clearance, while late prevention halted further aggregation. To address several challenges for clinical applications of gene correction, we developed a neuron-specific engineered virus-like particle to optimize neuronal ABE delivery, resulting in higher correction efficiency. Our findings provide a targeted strategy that may treat FENIB and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases due to altered protein conformation such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases.",

METHODS: In this study, we investigated 107 elderly adults individuals from a community in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, with an average age of 73.17 \u00b1 7.081 years. The participants included 52 patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease and 55 cognitively normal elderly adults control subjects. The two groups were matched based on gender, age, and education level. We assessed their cognitive functions and analyzed their genotypes and serum BDNF levels. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate the differences in serum BDNF levels between the MCI group and the control group. Multivariate linear regression was utilized to analyze the association between BDNF levels and susceptibility to MCI, as well as cognitive functions. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to investigate the association between BDNF gene polymorphisms and the risk of developing MCI, along with their interactions. RESULTS: The ANCOVA analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in serum BDNF levels between the MCI group and the control group (P > 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) total scores and MCI (r = -0.461, P = 0.001), with significant correlations observed in orientation (r = -0.420, P = 0.002). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that specific polymorphisms, including rs7103411 (CT+TT vs. CC), rs6265 (CT and CT+TT vs. CC), rs11030104 (AG and AG+GG vs. AA), and rs988748 (CG+CC vs. GG), were significantly associated with decreased serum BDNF levels (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that rs7103411 polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to MCI; individuals with the CT or CC genotype had a 0.370 times lower risk of developing MCI compared to those with the TT genotype (OR = 0.370, 95% CI: 0.141-0.970, P = 0.043). A significant interaction was found between rs7103411 and social activity, which influenced the risk of developing MCI. Specifically, individuals with the CT or TT genotype of rs7103411 who engaged in social activities had a significantly lower risk of developing MCI (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.117-0.878, P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that BDNF rs7103411\u3001rs6265\u3001rs11030104 and rs988748 are associated with decreased serum BDNF levels in MCI patients. Individuals carrying the TT genotype in the BDNF rs7103411 gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to MCI. Individuals with the rs7103411 CT or TT genotype who participated in social activities showed a significantly reduced risk of developing MCI, suggesting that the interaction between the BDNF rs7103411 genotype and social activity can help reduce the risk of MCI.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Chronic periodontitis and tooth loss contribute to cognitive decline. Since many biological processes are shared by loss of teeth and loss of pulps, this study investigated the potential association between loss of pulp and the development of dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted to investigate the association between dental treatment and the development of dementia. The records of dental treatment during the 10 years prior to the first diagnosis of dementia were extracted from the Elderly Cohort Database of the National Health Information Sharing Service of Korea. The independence of dementia compared to the number of pulps or teeth removed was evaluated using the chi-squared test. The subjects were grouped by the number of teeth or pulps treated, and their odds ratio for dementia was calculated. RESULTS: Analysis of 591,592 sessions for pulpectomy and 710,722 sessions for tooth extraction from 558,147 individuals revealed a significant association with Alzheimer's dementia, but not with vascular or unspecified dementia. The number of dementia patients based on the number of pulps or teeth extracted were significantly different across age groups. The odds ratios demonstrated a tendency to increase with the number of dental treatments and decrease with age at the time of diagnosis of dementia. The number of pulps removed to achieve a notable impact on Alzheimer's dementia was found to be lower than the number of teeth extracted. CONCLUSION: The loss of pulp increased incidence of Alzheimer's dementia, with the impact being more pronounced in younger geriatric groups.",

As an antioxidant iron chelator, its mechanisms are multimodal, involving the binding of brain iron and the consequent engagement of several pathways to counter pathogenesis across multiple diseases. We and other research groups have shown that IN DFO rescues cognitive impairment in several rodent models of Alzheimer Disease (AD). METHODS: This study was designed to probe dosing regimens to inform future clinical trials, while exploring mechanisms within the intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ) model. RESULTS: Five weeks of daily IN dosing of Long Evans rats with 15\u202f\u03bcL of a 1% (0.3\u202fmg), but not 0.1% (0.03\u202fmg), solution of DFO rescued cognitive impairment caused by ICV STZ administration as assessed with the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test of spatial memory and learning. Furthermore, IN DFO modulated several aspects of the neuroinflammatory milieu of the ICV STZ model, which was assessed through a novel panel of brain cytokines and immunohistochemistry. Using RNA-sequencing and pathway analysis, STZ was shown to induce several pathways of cell death and neuroinflammation, and IN DFO engaged multiple transcriptomic pathways involved in hippocampal neuronal survival. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this study is the first to assess the transcriptomic pathways and mechanisms associated with either the ICV STZ model or DFO treatment, and the first to demonstrate efficacy at this low dose.",

Patients with nHIBD are at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the shared pathogenesis of patients affected with both neurological disorders has not been fully elucidated. PURPOSE: We here aim to identify the shared molecular signatures between nHIBD and AD. We used an integrated analysis of the cortex gene expression data, targeting differential expression of genes related to the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment following traumatic brain injury. METHODS: The gene expression profiles of Alzheimer's disease (GSE203206) and that of Neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage (GSE23317) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of Alzheimer's disease and neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage by limma package analysis, five kinds of analyses were performed on them, namely Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network, DEG-transcription factor interactions and DEG-microRNA interactions, protein-drug interactions and protein-disease association analysis, and gene-inflammation association analysis and protein-inflammation association analysis. RESULTS: In total, 12 common DEGs were identified including HSPB1, VIM, MVD, TUBB4A, AACS, ANXA6, DIRAS2, RPH3A, CEND1, KALM, THOP1, AREL1. We also identified 11 hub proteins, three central regulatory transcription factors, and three microRNAs encoded by the DEGs. Protein-drug interaction analysis showed that CYC1 and UQCRFS1 are associated with different drugs. Gene-disease association analysis shows Mammary Neoplasms, Neoplasm Metastasis, Schizophrenia, and Brain Ischemia diseases are the most relevant to the hub proteins we identified. Gene-inflammation association analysis shows that the hub gene AREL1 is related to inflammatory response, while the protein-inflammation association analysis shows that the hub proteins AKT1 and MAPK14 are related to inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into the shared molecular mechanisms between AD and nHIBD. These common pathways and hub genes could potentially be used to design therapeutic interventions, reducing the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease development in survivors of neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemia brain injury.",

METHODS: Using 2D gray level co-occurrence matrix (2D-GLCM) texture features, volume, standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR), and obesity from different neuroimaging modalities, the study applies various classifiers, demonstrating a feature importance analysis in each region of interest. The research employs four classifiers, namely linear support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression (LR), and logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent (LRSGD) classifiers, to determine feature importance, leading to subsequent validation using a probabilistic neural network classifier. RESULTS: The research highlights the critical role of brain texture features, particularly in memory regions, for AD detection. Significant sex-specific differences are observed, with males showing significance in texture features in memory regions, volume in vision regions, and SUVR in speech regions, while females exhibit significance in texture features in memory and speech regions, and SUVR in vision regions. Additionally, the study analyzes how obesity affects features used in AD prediction models, clarifying its effects on speech and vision regions, particularly brain volume.

The objective of this research was to construct and validate a nomogram-based predictive model for the identification of cognitive impairment in older people suffering from cardiovascular diseases. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study included 498 participants with cardiovascular diseases aged >60 selected from the NHANES 2011-2014. The study employed the Minor Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model, in conjunction with multivariate logistic regression analysis, to identify relevant variables and develop a predictive model. We used statistical techniques as in the Minor Absolute Shrinkage (MAS) and the Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model, in conjunction with multivariate logistic regression analysis, to identify variables that were significantly predictive of the outcome. After which, based on the selected relevant variables, we developed a machine learning model that was predictive of cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's diseases in the older people. The effectiveness of the resultant nomogram was evaluated by assessing its discriminative capability, calibration, and conducting decision curve analysis (DCA). The constructed predictive nomogram included age, race, educational attainment, poverty income ratio, and presence of sleep disorder as variables. The model demonstrated robust discriminative capability, achieving an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.756, and exhibited precise calibration. Consistent performance was confirmed through 10-fold cross-validation, and DCA deemed the nomogram clinically valuable. CONCLUSION: We constructed a NHANES cardiovascular-based nomogram predictive model of cognitive impairment.

There are up to 1000 species on the surface of human skin and mucosal system, among which gut microbiota attracts the most interest. As the beginning of the digestive tract, oral cavity is also an important microbial habitat in the human body which is the first line of defense against pathogens entering the body. Many studies have revealed that oral microbial dysbiosis could not only contribute to oral diseases but also whole-body systemic diseases and health status. Oral microorganisms can enter the gastrointestinal tract with saliva and food, or enter the blood circulation through mouth breakage, thus causing systemic inflammation and aging-related diseases including some causal links to Alzheimer's disease. A series of changes take place in oral microbial composition during development, with different age stages marked by different dominant microbial species. Despite a lack of comprehensive studies on aging oral microbiota, through systemic inflammation, oral pathogenic microbes are likely to contribute inflammatory aging.

Evidence regarding non-invasive and early-stage biomarkers remains limited. Our aim was to identify retinal biomarkers for the risk of AD and FTD in populations without dementia and explore underlying brain structural mechanisms. METHODS: We included a total of 3,0573 UK Biobank participants without dementia, ocular disorders, and diabetes who underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the associations between macular OCT parameters and the risk of AD and FTD. Mediation analysis was used to explore the underlying mechanisms affected by brain structures. RESULTS: The mean age at recruitment was 55.27, and 46.10% of the participants were male. During a mean follow-up of 9.15\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.59\u202fyears, 148 patients with AD and eight patients with FTD were identified. Reduced thickness of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) at baseline was associated with an increased risk of AD (HR, 1.033; 95% CI, 1.001-1.066; P\u202f=\u202f0.044), while thinner retinal pigment epithelial in the inner superior subfield at baseline was associated with an elevated risk of FTD (HR, 1.409; 95% CI, 1.060-1.871; P\u202f=\u202f0.018). Structurally abnormal visual pathways, including cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes, as well as white matter integrity, mediated the association between the GC-IPL thickness and AD risk. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide preliminary empirical support for a relationship between prodromal changes in retinal layers and a higher risk of AD or FTD, suggesting that macular OCT may serve as a non-invasive, sensitive biomarker of high-risk years before the onset of dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the leading neurodegenerative diseases that affect the human population. Several hypotheses are in the pipeline to establish the commencement of this disease; however, the amyloid hypothesis is one of the most widely accepted ones. Amyloid plaques are rich in Amyloid Beta (A\u03b2) proteins, which are found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. They are the spliced product of a transmembrane protein called Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP); when they enter into the amylogenic pathway, they get cleaved simultaneously by Beta and Gamma Secretase and produce A\u03b2 protein. Appearances of Amyloid plaques are the significant clinical hallmarks of this disease. AD is mainly present in two genetically distinct forms; sporadic and familial AD. Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (sAD) is marked by a later clinical onset of the disease, whereas, familial Alzheimer's Disease (fAD) is an early onset of the disease with mendelian inheritance. Several mutations have been clinically reported in the last decades that have shown a direct link with fAD. Many of those mutations are reported to be present in the APP. In this study, we selected a few significant mutations present in the A\u03b2 stretch of the APP and tried to differentiate the wild-type A\u03b2 dimers formed in sAD and the mutant dimers formed in fAD through molecular modelling as there are no structures available from wet-lab studies till date. We analysed the binding interactions leading to formations of the dimers. Our next aim was to come up with a solution to treat AD using the method of drug repurposing. For that we used virtual screening and molecular docking simulations of the already existing anti-inflammatory drugs and studied their potency in resisting the formation of A\u03b2 dimers. This is the first such report of drug repurposing for the treatment of AD, which might pave new pathways in therapy.",

The extracellular domain (ECD) of TREM2 interacts with a wide-range of ligands, yet the molecular mechanism underlying recognition of such ligands to this class I receptor remains underexplored. Herein, we undertook a systematic investigation for exploring the mode of ligand recognition in immunoglobulin-like ectodomain by employing both knowledge-based and machine-learning guided molecular docking approach followed by the state-of-the-art all atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Besides the known binding site formed by complementarity-determining regions (CDR) 1 and CDR2 loops, which enables the binding of different anionic ligands, our study identifies the presence of second binding site formed by \u03b2-strands towards the C-terminal end. We observe a dense network of hydrophobic contacts formed between the explored ligands and CDR loops and \u03b2-strands, specifically CDR1, CDR2, \u03b2-strand C', loop connecting \u03b2-strand D and E, and loop connecting \u03b2-strand E and F. Ligand binding in immunoglobulin-like ectodomain increases the conformational flexibility of CDR2 loop, thus most frequently observed pathogenic variants i.e. R47H and R62H in TREM2 may affect the development and progression of AD. Our knowledge-based and machine-learning guided docking and physics-based simulations study unveils deep insights into the endogenous ligand recognition by the positive surface ligand binding site and distant core site pave the way for exploration of other small molecules towards development of novel therapeutics against Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Mild cognitive impairment and dementia (CI) are common in patients with CKD. We aim to clarify whether and how CKD and CI coexistence increases adverse health outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted on CKD patients (stages 3-5) from the TriNetX platform. CKD patients with and without pre-existing CI were included from 115 healthcare organizations, and their outcomes were compared. The two cohorts were propensity score matched (PSM) for age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, BMI, blood parameters, and medications. The proportional hazard assumption was tested with a 95% confidence interval. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate survival probability. Outcomes were included from 1 day after the CKD diagnosis until 10 years afterwards. RESULTS: We identified 533\u00a0772 CKD patients, and 8184 had co-existent CI. Two cohorts of 8170 PSM patients each were generated. The mean age was 60.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.0 years and the eGFR was 52.1\u00b119\u00a0mL/min. Mean follow-up was 23.2 months. CKD patients with CI had higher all-cause mortality (18.5% vs 12.6%), higher risk of cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs 6.9%), transient cerebral ischemic attacks (2.7% vs 1.6%), hypotension (16.5%-12.5%), malnutrition (6.7% vs 4.0%), pneumonia (10.7% vs 7.9%), urinary infections (13.2% vs 9.3%), encephalopathy (9.9% vs 5.0%), mood disorders (13.6% vs 9.7%), psychosis (9.8% vs 4.6%), and epilepsy (4.3% vs 1.5%). Higher use of antidepressants (26.3% vs 16.3%), anticonvulsants (19.5% vs 15.1%), antipsychotics (18.6% vs 9.1%), anticholinesterase (5.6% vs 0.1%), and benzodiazepines (30.6% vs 26.6%) was noted in those with CI. All these findings were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of a retrospective study, real-world data demonstrate that concomitant CI is a decisive risk factor for higher mortality and increased adverse outcomes in patients with CKD. These results highlight the need for routine comprehensive cognitive assessments in patients at any stage of CKD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, clinically characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral disturbances. Its pathogenesis is not fully comprehended but involves intracellular depositions of amyloid beta peptide (A\u03b2) and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau. Currently, pharmacological interventions solely slow the progression of symptoms. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a simple and valuable organism to study the dynamics of A\u03b2. It may contribute to advancing our comprehension of AD development and progression, as well as to discovering new treatments. Herein, we describe usual protocols for evaluating A\u03b2 aggregation and toxicity in transgenic C. elegans models of AD (CL2006, CL4176, GMC101, and CL2355 strains) through the visualization and quantification of the peptide with specific fluorescent dyes, in addition to the analysis of particular behaviors (paralysis and chemotaxis associated with learning).",

The vital pathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptide and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein. The current animal models used in AD research do not precisely replicate disease pathophysiology, making it difficult for researchers to quickly and effectively gather data or screen potential therapy possibilities. Several transgenic animals are used as models for AD; however, they have cost and time concerns. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become a suitable model organism for high-throughput pharmacological screening of neuroactive substances and neurodegenerative research. The past few decades have seen a significant increase in research on AD. The fight against amyloidosis has, however, been unexpectedly unsuccessful. It may be due to a need for more relevant in vivo models for high throughput screening, which emphasizes the need to find other anti-AD models. Alternative animal models, including zebrafish, have developed into a potentially useful research tool that must be employed for AD research to be effective.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Aronia extract or its active compounds, especially anthocyanin, have shown potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathologies, including neuroinflammation, fibrillogenesis of amyloid beta (A\u03b2), and cognitive impairment. However, there was still concern about their structural instability in vivo and in vitro. To solve the instability of anthocyanins, we combined aronia bioactive factions (ABFs) and alginic acid via electrostatic molecular interactions and created an ABF-alginic acid nanocomplex (AANCP). We evaluated whether it is more stable and effective in cognitive disorder mice and neuroinflammation cell models. METHODS: The physicochemical properties of the AANCP, such as nanoparticle size, structural stability, and release rate, were characterized. The AANCP was administered to scopolamine-injected Balb/c mice, and to BV2 microglia treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and amyloid beta (A\u03b2). Inflammation responses were measured via qPCR and ELISA in vitro, and cognitive functions were measured via behavior tests in vivo. RESULTS: The AANCP readily formed nanoparticles, 209.6 nm in size, with a negatively charged zeta potential. The AANCP exhibited better stability in four plasma samples (human, dog, rat, and mouse) and was slowly released in different pH conditions (pH 2.0, 7.4, and 8.0) compared with non-complexedABF. In vitro studies on microglial cells treated with AANCPs revealed a suppression of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6) induced by LPS. The AANCP increased microglial A\u03b2 phagocytosis through the activation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2)-related microglial polarization. The AANCP inhibited aggregation of A\u03b2 in vitro and alleviated cognitive impairment in a scopolamine-induced in vivo dementia mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that AANCPs are more stable than ABFs and effective for cognitive disorders and neuroinflammation via modulation of M2 microglial polarization.",

Methods: The physical properties of Chol-PEG assemblies were characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Inhibitory effects on A\u03b2 aggregation were assessed via thioflavin T (ThT) assay, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native-PAGE). Results: Chol-PEG2000 micelles and Chol-PEG500 vesicles were found to exhibit diameters of 20-30 nm and 70-80 nm, respectively, with neutral surface charges and those physical properties indicated the high affinity for A\u03b2. At a 10-fold molar ratio, thioflavin T (ThT) assay revealed that Chol-PEG2000 delayed A\u03b2 fibril elongation by 20 hours, while Chol-PEG500 delayed it by 40 hours against A\u03b2 peptide. At a 50-fold molar ratio, both Chol-PEG2000 and Chol-PEG500 significantly inhibited A\u03b2 aggregation, as indicated by minimal fluorescence intensity increases over 48 hours. CD spectroscopy indicated that A\u03b2 maintained its random coil structure in the presence of Chol-PEG assemblies at a 50-fold molar ratio. Native-PAGE analysis demonstrated a retardation in A\u03b2 migration immediately after mixing with Chol-PEG assemblies, suggesting complex formation. However, this retardation disappeared within 5 min, implying rapid dissociation of the complexes. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that Chol-PEG500 vesicles more effectively inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation than Chol-PEG2000 micelles. Chol-PEG assemblies perform as DDS carriers to be capable of inhibiting A\u03b2 aggregation. Chol-PEG assemblies can deliver additional therapeutics targeting other aspects of AD pathology. This dual-function platform shows promise as both a DDS carrier and a therapeutic agent, potentially contributing to a fundamental cure for AD.",

Urban, family Apiaceae (CAW), improves cognitive function in mouse models of aging and Alzheimer's disease and affects dendritic arborization, mitochondrial activity, and oxidative stress in mouse primary neurons. Triterpenes (TT) and caffeoylquinic acids (CQA) are constituents associated with these bioactivities of CAW, although little is known about how interactions between these compounds contribute to the plant's therapeutic benefit. Methods: Mouse primary cortical neurons were treated with CAW or equivalent concentrations of four TT combined, eight CQA combined, or these twelve compounds combined (TTCQA). Treatment effects on the cell transcriptome (18,491 genes) and metabolome (192 metabolites) relative to vehicle control were evaluated using RNAseq and metabolomic analyses, respectively. Results: Extensive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were seen with all treatments, as well as evidence of interactions between compounds. Notably, many DEGs seen with TT treatment were not observed in the TTCQA condition, possibly suggesting CQA reduced the effects of TT. Moreover, additional gene activity seen with CAW as compared to TTCQA indicates the presence of additional compounds in CAW that further modulate TTCQA interactions. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified 4 gene co-expression modules altered by treatments that were associated with extracellular matrix organization, fatty acid metabolism, cellular response to stress and stimuli, and immune function. Compound interaction patterns were seen at the eigengene level in these modules. Interestingly, in metabolomics analysis, the TTCQA treatment saw the highest number of changes in individual metabolites (20), followed by CQA (15), then TT (8), and finally CAW (3). WGCNA analysis found two metabolomics modules with significant eigenmetabolite differences for TT and CQA and possible compound interactions at this level. Conclusions: Four gene expression modules and two metabolite modules were altered by the four treatment types applied. This methodology demonstrated the existence of both negative and positive interactions between TT, CQA, and additional compounds found in CAW on the transcriptome and metabolome of mouse primary cortical neurons.",

The oligomeric form of A\u03b2 is acknowledged as the most neurotoxic, propelling the pathological progression of AD. Interestingly, besides A\u03b2, other proteins are co-localized within amyloid plaques. Peptide analogs corresponding to the \"aggregation-prone\" regions (APRs) of these proteins could exhibit high-affinity binding to A\u03b2 and significant inhibitory potential against the A\u03b2 oligomerization process. The peptide analogs of co-localized protease, Cathepsin B, may act as such potent inhibitors. In silico studies on the complexes of the oligomeric state of A\u03b2 and Cathepsin B peptide analogs were performed utilizing molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that these analogs disrupt the \u03b2-sheet-rich core of A\u03b2 oligomers, a critical structural feature of their stability. Of the four peptide analogs evaluated, two demonstrated considerable potential by effectively destabilizing oligomers while maintaining low self-aggregation propensity, i.e., a crucial consideration for therapeutic safety.

Our recent data further suggest that preE is associated with impaired autophagy, vascular dysfunction, and proteinopathy/tauopathy disorder, similar to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the presence of the cis stereo-isoform of phosphorylated tau (cis P-tau), amyloid-\u03b2, and transthyretin in the placenta and circulation. This review provides an overview of the factors that may lead to the induction and accumulation of cis P-tau-like proteins by focusing on the inactivation of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (Pin1) that catalyzes the cis to trans isomerization of P-tau. We also highlighted the novel role of the Pin1-cis P-tau-ApoE axis in the development of preE, and propagation of cis P-tau-mediated abnormal protein aggregation (tauopathy) from the placenta to cerebral tissues later in life, leading to neurodegenerative conditions. In the case of preE, proteinopathy/tauopathy may interrupt trophoblast differentiation and induce cell death, similar to the events occurring in neurons. These events may eventually damage the endothelium and cause systemic features of disorders such as preE. Despite impressive research and therapeutic advances in both fields of preE and neurodegenerative diseases, further investigation of Pin1-cis P-tau and ApoE-related mechanistic underpinnings may unravel novel therapeutic options, and new transcriptional and proteomic markers. This review will also cover genetic polymorphisms in the ApoE alleles leading to dyslipidemia induction that may regulate the pathways causing preE or dementia-like features in the reproductive age or later in life, respectively.",

This study explores the production of fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) from three co-products: the heads and bones of black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo), the carcasses of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), and the trimmings of Nile perch (Lates niloticus). Four enzymatic hydrolysis systems were tested: an endopeptidase (Alcalase, A), an exopeptidase (Protana, P), two-stage hydrolysis with an endopeptidase followed by an exopeptidase (A + P), and a single stage with endo- and exopeptidase (AP). The results show that combined enzymatic treatments, especially single-stage Alcalase and Protana (AP), achieved high protein yields (80%) and enhanced degrees of hydrolysis (34 to 49%), producing peptides with lower molecular weights. FPH exhibited significant antioxidant activity, in 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays, with EC50 values below 5 mg/mL. Additionally, AP hydrolysates demonstrated over 60% angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition at 5 mg/mL, indicating potential antihypertensive applications. Antidiabetic and anti-Alzheimer activities were present, but at relatively low levels. AP hydrolysates, especially from gilthead seabream, proved to be the most promising.

This study aimed to analyze MOP harvested in Japan for specific bioactive compounds and to explore its health applications in dogs, including effects on gut microbiota and cognitive symptoms. Methods: Flavonoid content (particularly hesperidin and nobiletin) of MOP was measured. High-flavonoid MOP was then incorporated into gelatin cubes. In the time-course blood concentration study, experimental beagle dogs received a single oral dose (4 g). For intestinal microbiota analysis and blood biochemical tests, beagle dogs were administered 1 g twice daily. For the Demonstration Test, older dogs (a 14-year-old female Shiba Inu, a 14-year-old female Miniature Dachshund, and a 19-year-old male Miniature Dachshund) were administered 1 g twice daily. Analysis included microbiota profiling via 16S rDNA sequencing and observational assessment of cognitive indicators in a pilot study involving senior dogs with Alzheimer's disease. Results: The MOP powder contained 9.3% hesperidin in early-ripening varieties (October harvest) and 6.9% in ripe varieties (December harvest). Nobiletin content was 41 mg/100 g (0.041%) and 35 mg/100 g (0.035%) for the early and late harvests, respectively.

While acute neuroinflammation plays a protective role by facilitating pathogen clearance and tissue repair, chronic and dysregulated inflammation contributes significantly to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. This review explores the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation, focusing on the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and peripheral immune cells. Key signaling pathways, including NF-\u03baB, JAK-STAT, and the NLRP3 inflammasome, are discussed alongside emerging regulators such as non-coding RNAs, epigenetic modifications, and the gut-brain axis. The therapeutic landscape is evolving, with traditional anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs and corticosteroids offering limited efficacy in chronic conditions. Immunomodulators, gene and RNA-based therapeutics, and stem cell methods have all shown promise for more specific and effective interventions. Additionally, the modulation of metabolic states and gut microbiota has emerged as a novel strategy to regulate neuroinflammation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinically viable therapies.

In addition, adults with DS move slower and are not meeting the standard aerobic activity guidelines each week. The aim of this study was to examine if Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT) would improve cognitive planning as measured by the Tower of London (TOL), set switching as measured by the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and spatial memory as measured by the Corsi Block Test in adults with DS as compared to self-paced cycling. METHODS: Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to one of two interventions over eight weeks. (1) Thirteen older adults with DS completed the ACT intervention, which is stationary cycling with the assistance of a motor to maintain a cadence at least 35% greater than voluntary cycling. (2) Eleven older adults with DS completed voluntary cycling (VC).

While its precise etiology remains unclear, researchers have identified diverse pathological characteristics and molecular pathways associated with its progression. Advances in scientific research have increasingly highlighted the crucial role of non-coding RNAs in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. These non-coding RNAs regulate several biological processes critical to the advancement of the disease, offering promising potential as therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers. Therefore, this review aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease onset, with a particular focus on microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs associated with the disease. The review elucidates the potential pathogenic processes of Alzheimer's disease and provides a detailed description of the synthesis mechanisms of the three aforementioned non-coding RNAs. It comprehensively summarizes the various non-coding RNAs that have been identified to play key regulatory roles in Alzheimer's disease, as well as how these non-coding RNAs influence the disease's progression by regulating gene expression and protein functions. For example, miR-9 targets the UBE4B gene, promoting autophagy-mediated degradation of Tau protein, thereby reducing Tau accumulation and delaying Alzheimer's disease progression. Conversely, the long non-coding RNA BACE1-AS stabilizes BACE1 mRNA, promoting the generation of amyloid-\u03b2 and accelerating Alzheimer's disease development. Additionally, circular RNAs play significant roles in regulating neuroinflammatory responses. By integrating insights from these regulatory mechanisms, there is potential to discover new therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers for early detection and management of Alzheimer's disease.

RESULTS: 105 (29.49%) of the surgical patients perished in one year. At the end of the follow-up, n = 308 (86.52%) of the hip fracture patients had died. Age-adjusted mortality rates after hip fracture surgery were higher for men than for women, with a risk ratio (HR) of 1.48 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) between 1.07 and 2.15. Complications from heart, lung, or blood vessel diseases were the leading causes of death after hip replacement surgery, followed by Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Men were more susceptible to respiratory diseases, cancer, and heart and blood vessel diseases than women. After hip fracture, both the overall mortality rate and the gender-standardised death rate were three times that of the general population for each cause of death. CONCLUSION: During the study period, the mortality risk for hip fracture patients was three times that of the general population for the primary causes of death.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Autonomic dysfunction plays an essential role in dementia, however, it is not known whether electrocardiogram autonomic dysfunction-related indicators are associated with the severity of dementia. In this study, we attempted to investigate whether these indicators are correlated in patients with vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease compared with normal health individuals. For this purpose, we measured and analyzed the predictive value of heart rate deceleration capacity (DC), heart rate deceleration runs (DRs), heart rate acceleration capacity (AC) along with the plasma levels of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2). METHODS: We compared 83 dementia cases including 41 vascular dementia (VD), 42 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with 42 elderly health controls. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, DC, DRs, AC, and Lp-PLA2 levels were comprehensively evaluated. RESULTS: Our studies showed that DC and DRs in VD and AD groups were significantly lower than those in controls, while AC values were significantly higher. Furthermore, the risk stratification (high- and moderate-) of DC, DRs, and AC in VD and AD groups was increased, while the low-risk was simultaneously decreased. In addition, DC and DRs were positively while AC and Lp-PLA2 were negatively correlated with MMSE scores. Logistic regression analysis indicated that DC, DRs, AC, and Lp-PLA2 were associated with dementia. Moreover, the areas under the ROC curves showed that the combination of five variables and AC\u202f+\u202fLp-PLA2 were 0.970 (95% CI, 0.923-0.992) and 0.940 (95% CI, 0.882-0.974) were larger than each single indicator alone. CONCLUSION: Distinctive alterations in dynamic electrocardiogram-related indicators reveal a decline in autonomic nervous functions among individuals with dementia. By incorporating comprehensive analyses of DC, DRs, AC, and Lp-PLA2 values, the specificity and sensitivity of dementia diagnosis can be significantly enhanced.",

Accumulation of improperly folded proteins results in ER stress, accompanied by the reaction involving triggering unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is mediated through ER membrane-associated sensors, such as protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1\u03b1, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Prolonged stress triggers cell apoptotic reaction, resulting in cell death. Neuronal cells are especially susceptible to protein misfolding. Notably, ER and UPR malfunctions are linked to many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), delineated by accumulation of misfolded proteins. Notably, ATF family members play key roles in AD and PD pathogenesis. However, the connection between ER stress, UPR, and neuropathology is not yet fully understood. Here, we discuss our present knowledge of the association between ER stress, the UPR, and neurodegeneration in AD and PD. We also discuss the roles of ATF family members in AD and PD pathogenesis. Moreover, we provide a mechanistic clarification of how disease-related molecules affect ER protein homeostasis and explore recent findings that connect the UPR to neuronal plasticity.",

Here, we show that during the asymptomatic stage in a knockin (KI) mouse model of Alzheimer disease (APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F; APPKI), hippocampal hyperactivity occurs at the synaptic compartment, propagates to the soma, and is manifesting at low frequencies of stimulation. We show that this aberrant excitability is associated with a deficient adenosine tone, an inhibitory neuromodulator, driven by reduced levels of CD39/73 enzymes, responsible for the extracellular ATP-to-adenosine conversion. Both pharmacologic (adenosine kinase inhibitor) and non-pharmacologic (ketogenic diet) restorations of the adenosine tone successfully normalize hippocampal neuronal activity. Our results demonstrated that neuronal hyperexcitability during the asymptomatic stage of a KI model of Alzheimer disease originated at the synaptic compartment and is associated with adenosine deficient tone.

Preserving neuronal integrity and stimulating neurogenesis are promising therapeutic strategies to combat AD-related cognitive dysfunction. In this study, we synthesized metformin carbon dots (CMCDs) using a hydrothermal method with metformin hydrochloride and citric acid as precursors. Notably, we found that CMCDs were significantly more effective than metformin in promoting the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into functional neurons under amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) conditions. Moreover, CMCDs fostered NSCs proliferation, enhanced neurogenesis, reduced A\u03b2 deposition, and inhibited glial cell activation. We also examined neuronal structure by assessing Map2/NF-H/PSD95/SYN expression in the hippocampus, finding that CMCDs robustly strengthened neuronal structure. These results suggest that CMCDs can cognitive dysfunction in AD and promote the proliferation and neurogenesis of NSCs, as well as ameliorate neuronal injury. Hence, CMCDs emerge as promising candidates for AD therapy, demonstrating superior efficacy compared to metformin alone, and offering novel insights into small molecule drug interventions for AD.",

Faced with this challenge, we proposed using a state-of-the-art drug screening algorithm to identify potential therapeutic compounds for AD from traditional Chinese medicine formulas with strong empirical support. We developed four deep neural network (DNN) models for AD drugs screening at the disease and target levels. The AD model was trained with compounds labeled for AD activity to predict active compounds at the disease level, while the acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), and 5-hydroxytryptamine 6 (5-HT6) models were trained for specific AD targets. All four models performed excellently and were used to identify potential AD agents in the Kaixinsan (KXS) formula. High-scoring compounds underwent experimental validation at the enzyme, cellular, and animal levels. Compounds like 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol and elemicin showed significant binding and inhibitory effects on AChE and MAO-A.

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: The degree to which the allocation of disease-specific research funding by the NIH is proportional to disease burden is an important question. This study examined the historical relationship between NIH funding allocation and disease burden for a variety of medical conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Coefficients of relatedness for the linear relationships between funding and disease burden for 27 medical conditions over a period exceeding twenty years were calculated. METHODS: Publicly available data from 2009 to 2019, and previously published data from 1994 to 2004, was obtained to compare disease-specific research funding from the NIH to burden of disease values (mortality, prevalence, incidence, DALYs, and YLLs) for 27 diseases. RESULTS: We identified very weak and declining correlations (e.g., R2\u00a0<\u00a00.03) between funding and the five measures of burden for the 27 diseases. The weak relationships persist even when HIV/AIDS is omitted (e.g., R2\u00a0<\u00a00.1). A recent decline in the overall strengths of the funding burden relationships is attributable to novel investment in Alzheimer's disease research. CONCLUSIONS: The weak correlations reveal long-standing inefficiencies in the NIH disease funding allocation process. The recent increased and focused funding for Alzheimer's disease may not be justified by an objective analysis which considers disease burdens. Increased efficiency of medical research may be realized by improving the poor match between disease burden and funding allocation.",

The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the impact of viral infections on frail populations. The present work aimed to determine frailty, functional and cognitive status, and clinical analysis of older persons in a long-term care facility in Chile, before and following the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods. A single-center, pre-post, and Pearson's correlational study was conducted in a cohort of 20 persons positive for COVID-19 from a total of 45 residents. Data on demographic, clinical, functional (Barthel Index (BI) and Katz) and cognitive (Mini mental Examination) status, and physiological function (hematology, lipidic and biochemical profiles) were collected. Results. The mean age was 84 \u00b1 2.4 years, and 80% were females. The most common comorbidities were Arterial Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus type II, and Alzheimer's disease. Physical frailty was confirmed by body weight, body mass index, and calf circumference. Pre-infection, BI was negatively correlated with lipidic profile and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and positively with frailty (calf circumference). Pre-post analysis showed that frailty and most analytical results were not modified. However, functional dependence on daily live activities significantly increased as measured by BI, with worse grooming and bowel and bladder controls. Post-infection, correlations were lost except between BI and ESR, and decreased albumin levels were found. Conclusions. The worsening of specific functional limitations emphasizes the need for targeted interventions that can be correlated with ESR.

Turning on the spot for one minute in alternating directions (360 turn) while performing a cognitive dual-task (DT) is a fast and sensitive way to provoke FOG. The FOG-index is a widely used wearable sensor-based algorithm to quantify FOG severity during turning. Despite that, the FOG-index's classification performance and criterion validity is not tested against the gold standard (i.e., video-rated time spent freezing). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the FOG-index's classification performance and criterion validity to assess FOG severity during 360 turn. Additionally, we investigated the FOG-index's optimal cutoff values to differentiate between PwPD with and without FOG. METHODS: 164 PwPD self-reported the presence of FOG on the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOGQ) and performed the DT 360 turn in the ON medication state while being videoed and wearing five wearable sensors. Two independent clinical experts rated FOG on video. ROC-AUC values assessed the FOG-index's classification accuracy against self-reported FOG and expert ratings. Spearman-rho was used to evaluate the correlation between expert and FOG-index ratings of FOG severity. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients self-reported FOG, while 104 were classified as a freezer by the experts. The FOG-index had limited classification agreement with the NFOGQ (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.60, p\u202f=\u202f0.115, sensitivity 46.4%, specificity 72.8%) and the experts (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.65, p\u202f<\u202f0.001, sensitivity 68.3%, specificity 61.7%). Only weak correlations were found between the algorithm outputs and expert ratings for FOG severity (rho\u202f=\u202f0.13-0.38). CONCLUSION: A surprisingly large discrepancy was found between self-reported and expert-rated FOG during the 360 turning task, indicating PwPD do not always notice FOG in daily life. The FOG-index achieved suboptimal classification performance and poor criterion validity to assess FOG severity. Regardless, 360 turning proved a sensitive task to elicit FOG. Further development of the FOG-index is warranted, and long-term follow-up studies are needed to assess the predictive value of the 360 turning task for classifying FOG conversion.",

Through RNA-sequencing in frontal- and occipital-WM bulk tissues, we identified an upregulation of genes associated with brain vasculature function in AD white matter. To further elucidate vasculature-specific transcriptomic features, we performed RNA-seq analysis on blood vessels isolated from these white matter regions, which revealed an upregulation of genes related to protein folding pathways. Finally, comparing gene expression profiles between AD individuals with high- versus low-WMH burden showed an increased expression of pathways associated with immune function. Taken together, our study characterizes the diverse molecular profiles of white matter changes in AD and provides mechanistic insights into the processes underlying AD-related WMHs.",

While bacteria have traditionally been the focus of gut microbiome studies, recent evidence suggests that fungal communities (mycobiota) may also play a crucial role in modulating health, particularly in neuropsychiatric disorders. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge on the relationship between the gut mycobiome and neuropsychiatric disorders, exploring the potential of targeting fungal communities as a novel therapeutic strategy. METHODS: We summarized recent findings from metagenomic analyses that characterize the diversity and composition of gut mycobiota and discuss how these communities interact with the host and other microorganisms via the gut-brain axis. Key methodologies for studying mycobiota, such as high-throughout sequencing and bioinformatics approaches, were also reviewed to highlight advances in the field. RESULTS: Emerging research links gut mycobiota dysbiosis to conditions such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, and depression. Studies indicate that specific fungal populations, such as Candida and Saccharomyces, may influence neuroinflammation, gut permeability and immune responses, thereby affecting mental health outcomes. CONCLUSION: Understanding the gut mycobiome's role in neuropsychiatric disorders opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions, including antifungal treatments, probiotics, and dietary modifications.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The measurement of brain activation links neurobiological and functional aspects but is challenging in patients with dementia. This study investigated the influence of rTMS on cortical activation in patients with AD and depressive symptoms, measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a verbal fluency task. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind study, patients with AD and depression received either active rTMS (n\u202f=\u202f17) or sham-rTMS (n\u202f=\u202f16). Patients received 4\u202fweeks of bilateral standard rTMS (1\u202fHz rTMS delivered to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and 10-Hz rTMS delivered to the left DLPFC). RESULTS: No significant changes were found in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI); however, significant changes were found for the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the depression score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-depression; p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The results showed a decrease in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin, as measured with fNIRS, from baseline to week 4 in CH41 (in right DLPFC; p\u202f=\u202f0.0047, FDR-corrected).

Alzheimer's disease leads to a rapid and irreversible decline in cognitive abilities by damaging memory cells. METHODS: A ResNet-18-based system is proposed, integrating Depth Convolution with a Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block to minimize tuning parameters. This design is based on analyses of existing deep learning architectures and feature extraction techniques. Additionally, pre-trained ResNet-18 models were created with and without the SE block to compare ROC and accuracy values across different hyperparameters. RESULTS: The proposed model achieved ROC values of 95% for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), 95% for Cognitively Normal (CN), and 93% for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), with a maximum test accuracy of 88.51%. However, the pre-trained model with SE had 93.26% accuracy and ROC values of 98%, 99%, and 98%, while the model without SE had 94%, 97%, and 94% ROC values and 92.41% accuracy. DISCUSSION: Collecting medical data can be expensive and raises ethical concerns. Small data sets are also prone to local minima issues in the cost function. A scratch model that experiences extensive hyperparameter tuning may end up being either overfitted or underfitted. Class imbalance also reduces performance. Transfer learning is most effective with small, imbalanced datasets, and pre-trained models with SE blocks perform better than others. The proposed model introduced a method to reduce training parameters and prevent overfitting from imbalanced medical data. Overall performance findings show that the suggested approach performs better than the state-of-the-art techniques.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by progressive decline of memory and cognitive functions, and it is the leading cause of dementia accounting for 60%-80% of dementia patients. A pathological hallmark of AD is the accumulation of aberrant protein/peptide aggregates such as extracellular amyloid plaques containing amyloid-beta peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. These aggregates result from the failure of the proteostasis network, which encompasses protein synthesis, folding, and degradation processes. Autophagy is an intracellular self-digesting system responsible for the degradation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Impaired autophagy is observed in most neurodegenerative disorders, indicating the link between autophagy dysfunction and these diseases. A massive accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in neurons in Alzheimer's brains evidences autophagy impairment in AD. Modulating autophagy has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for AD because of its potential to clear aggregated proteins. However, autophagy modulation therapy for AD is not yet clinically available. This mini-review aims to summarize clinical studies testing potential autophagy modulators for AD and to evaluate their proximity to clinical use.

        "AbstractText": "Cryopreservation, the preservation of tissues at subzero temperatures, is a mainstay of brain banking that allows for the storage of brain tissue without the use of chemical fixatives. This is particularly important for molecular studies that are incompatible with tissue fixation. However, brain tissue is vulnerable to various forms of damage during the cryopreservation process, in particular due to the phase transition of water from a liquid to a solid state with the formation of ice crystals, which can disrupt cellular morphology. There is a critical need to characterize the effects of cryopreservation on brain cell structure at the microscopic level. In this review, we conducted a comprehensive literature search, identifying 97 studies that yielded 146 distinct observations of the effects of cryopreservation on neurohistology. We classified the reviewed studies into three main categories: cryofixation, freezing, and cryopreservation with cryoprotectants. Cryofixation techniques enable vitrification and excellent ultrastructural preservation of thin tissue samples but are limited in terms of the depth of tissue that can be preserved without ice artifacts. Freezing methods, particularly when applied to brain slices, can achieve rapid cooling rates that result in minimal ice artifacts detectable by light microscopy. Cryoprotectant-based approaches have the potential to reduce ice damage and achieve vitrification. For thin tissue samples, immersion in cryoprotectants has been found to be effective for structural preservation. However, for larger samples or the entire brain, perfusion of cryoprotectants is necessary to perform rapid distribution, and this has a more limited evidence base. In conclusion, while current cryopreservation methods can provide sufficient quality for some downstream applications, there is a need for improved techniques that enable the cryopreservation of larger brain tissue samples while maintaining excellent structural preservation.",

In AD, Tau aggregates interact with NPC proteins, known as nucleoporins, leading to disruptions in nuclear transport. Hyperphosphorylated Tau, a hallmark of AD pathology, interacts with central channel NUPs such as Nup62 and Nup98, causing cytoplasmic mis-localization of these proteins and impairing nuclear transport. Furthermore, Tau-NUP interactions promote Tau aggregation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, exacerbating neurodegeneration. Oligomeric Tau adheres to the lamin B receptor as well as nuclear lamin, preventing nucleocytoplasmic transport and resulting in heterochromatin unwinding, DNA damage, and neuronal death. The decrease in lamin B and increasing levels of lamin A along with C in AD-affected brain areas highlight the disease's intricacy. Furthermore, Tau internalization in the nucleus and interaction with nuclear pore complexes worsen NPC dysfunction, which contributes to neurotoxicity. Tau-DNA interactions suggest a chaperone-like role for Tau in DNA organization and repair, highlighting its involvement in maintaining genomic integrity. This review explores the intricate relationships between Tau, NPC components, and nuclear lamin in the context of AD, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying Tau-induced neurodegeneration and potential therapeutic targets.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease associated with dementia and neuronal impairments in brain. AD is characterized histopathologically by two hallmark lesions: abnormally phosphorylated Tau inside neurons as intracellular NFTs and extracellular accumulation of amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2). Furthermore, it is unable to clarify the distinction between the brief association between the development and build-up of A\u03b2 and the commencement of illness. Additionally, a number of experimental findings suggest that symptoms related to A\u03b2 may only manifest within the framework of anabatic Tauopathies. Tau, a natively unfolded protein, essentially involved in microtubule binding and assembly. Tau protein consists of truncated segment and the purpose of this truncated fragment is to initiate and promote the conversion of soluble Tau into aggregates. The most common aberrant posttranslational change found in Neuro Fibrillary Tangles\u00a0is hyperphosphorylation, which is essentially composed of aggregated Tau. Tau phosphorylation and acetylation of Tau protein at the locations controlled by histone deacetylase 6 compete, which modulates Tau function. Considering the potential benefits of targeting HDAC6 in AD, we propose focusing on the role of HDAC6 in regulating Tau functions and the other targets are the therapeutic understanding of AD.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Nuclear Tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.",
        "AbstractText": "Tau is a well-known microtubule-associated protein and is located in the cytoplasm of neurons, which play a crucial role in Alzheimer's diseases. Due to its preferred binding to DNA sequences found in the nucleolus and pericentromeric heterochromatin, Tau has been found within the cell nucleus, where it may be a nucleic acid-associated protein. Tau has the ability to directly interact with nuclear pore complex nucleoporins, influencing both their structural and functional integrity. The interaction between Tau and NUPs highlights a potential mechanism underlying NPC dysfunction in AD pathogenesis. Pathological Tau hinders the import and export of nucleus through RAN mediated cascades. Nuclear Tau aggregates colocalize with membrane less organelles called nuclear speckles, which are involved in pre-mRNA splicing, and modify their dynamics, composition, and structure. Additionally, SRRM2 and other nuclear speckle proteins including MSUT2 and PABPN1 mislocalize to cytosolic Tau aggregates, and causes propagation of Tau aggregates. Research highlights, Extracellular Tau Oligomers induce significant nuclear invagination. They act as a key player in the transformation of healthy neurons into sick neurons in AD. The mechanism behind this phenomenon depends on intracellular Tau and is linked to changes in chromatin structure, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and gene transcription. This review highlights the vital roles of nuclear Tau protein in the context of nuclear pore complex functioning and, modulation of nuclear speckles in Alzheimer's diseases. Addressing these pathways is essential for formulating focused therapeutics intended to alleviate Tau-induced neurodegeneration.",

In view of the potential availability of Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs), this French observatory aimed to describe the current organization of the Memory Centers, and the care pathway of patients suffering from early AD. Overall, 12 of the 28 RMRC and 44 of the 250 MC solicited by the Federation of Memory Centers participated in this study. RMRC and MC differed in the practicing specialists (neurologists in 100\u00a0% and 41\u00a0% of the structures, respectively; geriatricians in 58\u00a0% and 95\u00a0%), and in the median yearly number of patients with early AD (192 and 99). The majority of patients were referred to RMRC and MC by a general practitioner (42\u00a0% and 51\u00a0%, respectively) or a private neurologist (19\u00a0% and 6\u00a0%). The time between referral and the first visit to the Memory Center was shorter in MC compared to RMRC (<3\u00a0months: 51\u00a0% versus 34\u00a0%). Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were assessed in the majority of patients in 75\u00a0% of RMRC and 14\u00a0% of MC.

METHODS: The cohort established in 2013 consisted of 470 elderly from Beirut and Mount Lebanon, who consented to be followed-up. In 2017, we reached 341 participants/informants, achieving a response rate of 72.6%. The validated Arabic version of the 10/66 Dementia Research Group diagnostic tool was administered through face-to-face interviews. Direct age standardization was applied to the data using the Western European population distribution. Age-, sex- and location-specific incidence rates were estimated. RESULTS: After 3.5 years of follow up, 19 new cases of dementia were identified among 229 surviving participants. The crude incidence rate was 16.8 per 1,000 p-y, and the age standardized rate was 20.5 per 1,000 p-y. The incidence rate increased with age, going from 6.5 for those aged 65-74 years to 54.0 for those aged 85-89 years. Incidence rate was higher among females than males (20.7 vs.12.0), and higher in Mount Lebanon, as compared to the capital city Beirut (19.5 vs.14.9). CONCLUSION: Dementia incidence rate was close to European and North American countries' estimates. The use of validated tools increased the internal validity of our results.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the prevalence of diabetes and associated comorbidities among AD patients from different ethnic-racial groups - Asians, Whites, and NHPIs - in Hawaii, with a focus on identifying risk factors linked to AD. METHOD: A retrospective review was conducted on AD patient records from a single center in Hawaii, spanning June 2018 to June 2024. Variables assessed included age at diagnosis, sex, race, insurance type, alcohol use, comorbidities, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Statistical comparisons were conducted to identify group differences. RESULTS: Among 540 patients (256\u00a0Asians, 89 NHPIs, 182 Whites, and 13 Others), NHPIs exhibited the highest rates of hypertension (66.3%), diabetes (31.5%), obesity (23.6%), congestive heart failure (13.5%), and coronary artery disease (6.7%). Whites exhibited a higher prevalence of anxiety (18.1%), cardiac arrhythmia (15.4%), and alcohol use (37.4%) compared to Asians and NHPIs.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the association between neurodegenerative diseases and olfactory dysfunction (OD). Characterized by a decline in the ability to detect or identify odors, OD has been observed in various conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This phenomenon often precedes the onset of other clinical symptoms, suggesting its potential utility as an early marker or prodromal symptom of neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides a vast literature overview on the current knowledge of OD in PD, AD, ALS, and HD in order to evaluate its potential as a biomarker, particularly in the early and prodromal stages of these diseases. We summarize the most common methods used to measure olfactory function and delve into neuropathological correlations and the alterations in neurotransmitter systems associated with OD in those neurodegenerative diseases, including differences in genetic variants if applicable, and cater to current pitfalls and shortcomings in the research.",

There are various theories concerning the causes of AD, but the connection between viral and bacterial infections and their potential role in the pathogenesis of AD has become a fascinating area of research for the field. Various viruses such as Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza viruses, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as bacteria such as Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), Helicobacter pylori (HP), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Spirochetes and eukaryotic unicellular parasites (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii), have been linked to AD due to their ability to activate the immune system, induce inflammation and increase oxidative stress, thereby leading to cognitive decline and AD. In addition, microRNAs (miRNAs) might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis mechanisms of these pathogens since they are utilized to target various protein-coding genes, allowing for immune evasion, maintaining latency, and suppressing cellular signaling molecules. Also, they can regulate gene expression in human cells. This article provides an overview of the association between AD and various infectious agents, with a focus on the mechanisms by which these pathogens may be related to the pathogenesis of AD.

Maximizing translation should be central to animal research on human diseases, guiding researchers in study design and animal model selection. However, practical considerations often drive the choice of animal model, which may not always reflect key patient characteristics, such as sex and age, impacting the disease's course. Despite diseases affecting both sexes, researchers frequently use male mice. To address this imbalance, journals and funding agencies have begun questioning the sex of animals used in studies and issued new guidelines. Conversely, the age of rodents is rarely discussed, even though many diseases primarily affect older patients. Young mice are commonly used, even in studies of diseases affecting older adults. Systematic comparisons between the age of rodents used and the age of patients in clinical trials are lacking. In this review, we systematically analyze the age and sex of mice used to model the five leading causes of global disability-adjusted life-years over the age of 75. We compare the results with the age and sex of patients in clinical trials focusing on Alzheimer's disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We also analyze whether the age of the mice used has changed over the past decade.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction is widely used to assess the risk of diagnosis and progression of many diseases. Routinely, the weights of individual SNPs are estimated by the linear regression model that assumes independent and linear contribution of each SNP to the phenotype. However, for complex multifactorial diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and others, association between individual SNPs and disease could be non-linear due to epistatic interactions. The aim of the presented study is to explore the power of non-linear machine learning algorithms and deep learning models to predict the risk of multifactorial diseases with epistasis. METHODS: Simulated data with 2- and 3-loci interactions and tested three different models of epistasis: additive, multiplicative and threshold, were generated using the GAMETES. Penetrance tables were generated using PyTOXO package. For machine learning methods we used multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), Lasso regression, random forest and gradient boosting models. Performance of machine learning models were assessed using accuracy, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, recall, precision, and F1 score. RESULTS: First, we tested ensemble tree methods and deep learning neural networks against LASSO linear regression model on simulated data with different types and strength of epistasis. The results showed that with the increase of strength of epistasis effect, non-linear models significantly outperform linear. Then the higher performance of non-linear models over linear was confirmed on real genetic data for multifactorial phenotypes such as obesity, type 1 diabetes, and psoriasis. From non-linear models, gradient boosting appeared to be the best model in obesity and psoriasis while deep learning methods significantly outperform linear approaches in type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study underscores the efficacy of non-linear models and deep learning approaches in more accurately accounting for the effects of epistasis in simulations with specific configurations and in the context of certain diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: After Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common form of early-onset dementia. Despite the heavy burden of care for FTLD, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments with sufficient efficacy remain scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a multimodal exercise program for FTLD and to examine preliminary changes in the clinical outcomes of the program in FTLD. METHODS: This single-arm preliminary study was conducted from July 2017 to July 2018 and recruited 4 male patients with FTLD aged 60-78 years. Patients exercised under the supervision of an exercise instructor once every 2 weeks for 48 weeks. The multimodal exercise program comprised cognitive training, moderate-intensity continuous training, strength training, balance training, and flexibility and relaxation training. Feasibility was measured using dropout and attendance rates. Cognitive, psychological, physical, and behavioral function tests were conducted before and after the intervention. RESULTS: All patients completed the intervention (100%) and attended well (93.6%). Positive changes in scores in the Stroop Color-Word Test (cognitive; 5 out of 6 items), Mood Check List-short form 2 (psychological), movement subscales of the Stereotypy Rating Inventory (behavioral), and Timed Up and Go (TUG, physical) assessments demonstrated a medium-to-high effect size (open effect size: 0.52-0.97). While there were improvements in some domains, such as recovery self-efficacy and exercise efficacy, the MMSE-J scores showed an overall slight decline, especially in the semantic dementia case where a marked decrease was observed. Additionally, three physical function items showed no effect, except for a positive outcome in the TUG test. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy revealed increased activation in the frontal lobe, indicated by elevated oxygenated hemoglobin levels before and after the exercise intervention. This pattern of activation suggests that the intervention may have stimulated neural activity in the frontal lobe, potentially enhancing cognitive and behavioral functions, including executive function and attention. CONCLUSION: The long-term multimodal exercise intervention may be feasible and positively change the cognitive, psychological, physical, and behavioral functions in older adults with FTLD. Although the intervention led to improvements in certain areas, there were also declines observed in various functions, which may not necessarily be due to the intervention itself but rather reflect the natural progression of the disease.",

However, the relationship between overweight, obesity, and cognitive decline remains a subject of debate. The impact of sleep duration on cognitive performance in seniors with a body mass index (BMI)\u202f\u2265\u202f25\u202fkg/m2 is largely unknown. This makes it an intriguing subject to explore further. METHODS: This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2011-2014) with 2,243 participants. Weighted multivariate linear regression and smooth curve fitting were employed to investigate linear and non-linear relationships. A two-part linear regression model was used to determine the threshold effects. Additionally, subgroup analysis and interaction tests were conducted. RESULTS: Results showed that a negative association was found between sleep duration and scores in the fully adjusted model in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) test, the Animal Fluency test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST). A two-piecewise linear regression model was then applied to explore the threshold effect of sleep duration on cognitive performance. When sleep duration was less than 5 and 6\u202fh per day, sleep duration was positively correlated with CERAD test scores [\u00df (95% CI): 2.11 (1.17, 3.05), p <\u202f0.0001], AFT scores [\u03b2 (95% CI): 0.25 (-0.17, 0.67), p =\u202f0.2376], and DSST scores [\u00df (95% CI): 0.49 (-0.57, 1.56), p =\u202f0.3654]. However, there was a threshold effect where sleep duration reached the three inflection points. CONCLUSION: In overweight and obese older adults, there is a clear inverted U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and cognitive function, with consistent results across different subgroups. Sleep durations of around 5-6\u202fh may help prevent cognitive decline in older adults with a BMI\u202f\u2265\u202f25\u202fkg/m2.",

This study investigates the effects of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in a zebrafish AD model.

Cognitive impairments often serve as indicators of a bleak prognosis or the likelihood of progressing to dementia. Additionally, some studies suggest that individuals diagnosed with BD may undergo a decline in hippocampal volume. However, the potential for reversibility of these changes, particularly in adolescents, remains unclear. We present an intriguing case involving an 18-year-old male student who experiences concurrent occurrences of both BD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), accompanied by a subtle reduction in hippocampal volume. Initially, the individual exhibited impaired general cognitive function, as indicated by an IQ score of 80 on the Standard Raven's Progressive Matrices test, and demonstrated slightly reduced bilateral hippocampal volume compared to the normative reference, as determined through quantitative structural magnetic resonance imaging (qsMRI). The deposition profiles of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptide in the brain were not identified with 18F-AV45 PET/MRI. Following six months of combined psychopharmacological treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy, the individual's psychopathological symptoms improved significantly, leading to a restoration of his IQ score to 116 and normalization of hippocampal volume. This case suggests that the hippocampal volume reduction and cognitive impairment seen in some adolescents with BD may demonstrate greater plasticity compared to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).

        "AbstractText": "People suffering from a neurodegenerative disease, at a stage still allowing physical activity, encounter more difficulties to access to re-education and rehabilitation care. A trial unit specialized in medical care and rehabilitation (SMR) was created to handle these patients, who suffered a morbid intercurrent event not related to the neurocognitive disorder. The trial unit was created thanks to a dedicated funding from the Brittany Health Regional Agency (ARS) following-up a call for projects in October 2021. A retrospective monocentric descriptive study focusing on the overall evolution of the patient. To describe the social and medical characteristics of admitted patients and access the benefits regarding the patients regain of independence. Results: One hundred forty-nine patients (55\u00a0men, 94\u00a0women) were included, average age 85 \u00b1\u00a06.5 years. The average length of stay was 24 \u00b1\u00a011\u00a0days and the rehabilitative load was high (scores RR 275,2 \u00b1\u00a0175,2). A significant improvement in the autonomy of patients was noted, of their physical dependence scores (p <\u00a00,001) and cognitive dependence scores (p <\u00a00,001), of their overall physical condition at SPPB (p<0,001) as well as a decrease in the use of psychotropic drugs (p <\u00a00,001); their nutritional status was unchanged (p =\u00a00.2). One in two patients went home. Our work seems to confirm the importance of specialized units in the care of patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease in SMR.",

        "AbstractText": "Odors are known to entertain a special link with memory: once the meaning of an odor has been learned, it naturally acts as a retrieval cue of the learning context, along with the emotions and behaviors associated with it. The existence of this link has for several years inspired the study of olfactory function in Alzheimer's disease (AD), known for the memory disorders it causes. The aim of this review is to summarize the current scientific knowledge on the almost paradoxical dual role played by odors in the management of AD, as both screening and therapeutic tools. In fact, while the existence of a specific olfactory deficit is confirmed in AD - as is its ability to screen for the disease - its properties do not prevent from taking advantage of the link between odors and memory to stimulate cognition and behavior in these patients. Current scientific data, albeit limited and with sometimes inconsistent results, suggest that this idea seems relevant. However, interventions based on impaired processing in AD, such as the recognition and naming of olfactory stimuli, must be avoided.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Astrocytes phenomics as new druggable targets in healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease progression.",
        "AbstractText": "For over a century after their discovery astrocytes were regarded merely as cells located among other brain cells to hold and give support to neurons. Astrocytes activation, \"astrocytosis\" or A1 functional state, was considered a detrimental mechanism against neuronal survival. Recently, the scientific view on astrocytes has changed. Accumulating evidence indicate that astrocytes are not homogeneous, but rather encompass heterogeneous subpopulations of cells that differ from each other in terms of transcriptomics, molecular signature, function and response in physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we report and discuss the recent literature on the phenomic differences of astrocytes in health and their modifications in disease conditions, focusing mainly on the hippocampus, a region involved in learning and memory encoding, in the age-related memory impairments, and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The morphological and functional heterogeneity of astrocytes in different brain regions may be related to their different housekeeping functions. Astrocytes that express diverse transcriptomics and phenomics are present in strictly correlated brain regions and they are likely responsible for interactions essential for the formation of the specialized neural circuits that drive complex behaviors. In the contiguous and interconnected hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3, astrocytes show different, finely regulated, and region-specific heterogeneity. Heterogeneous astrocytes have specific activities in the healthy brain, and respond differently to physiological or pathological stimuli, such as inflammaging present in normal brain aging or beta-amyloid-dependent neuroinflammation typical of AD. To become reactive, astrocytes undergo transcriptional, functional, and morphological changes that transform them into cells with different properties and functions. Alterations of astrocytes affect the neurovascular unit, the blood-brain barrier and reverberate to other brain cell populations, favoring or dysregulating their activities. It will be of great interest to understand whether the differential phenomics of astrocytes in health and disease can explain the diverse vulnerability of the hippocampal areas to aging or to different damaging insults, in order to find new astrocyte-targeted therapies that might prevent or treat neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Xixin Decoction's novel mechanism for alleviating Alzheimer's disease cognitive dysfunction by modulating amyloid-\u03b2 transport across the blood-brain barrier to reduce neuroinflammation.",
        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Xixin Decoction (XXD) is a classical formula that has been used to effectively treat dementia for over 300 years. Modern clinical studies have demonstrated its significant therapeutic effects in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) without notable adverse reactions. Nevertheless, the specific mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain to be elucidated. This investigation sought to elucidate XXD's impact on various aspects of AD pathology, including blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment, neuroinflammatory processes, and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition, as well as the molecular pathways involved in these effects. METHODS: In vitro experiments were conducted using hCMEC/D3 and HBVP cell coculture to establish an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model. BBB damage was induced in this model by 24-h exposure to 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h of treatment with 10% XXD-medicated serum, the effects of XXD were assessed through Western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence techniques. In vivo, SAMP8 mice were administered various doses of XXD via gavage for 8\u00a0weeks, including high-dose XXD group (H-XXD) at 5.07\u00a0g\u00a0kg-1\u00b7d-1, medium-dose XXD group (M-XXD) at 2.535\u00a0g\u00a0kg-1\u00b7d-1, and low-dose XXD group (L-XXD) at 1.2675\u00a0g\u00a0kg-1\u00b7d-1. Cognitive function was subsequently evaluated using the Morris water maze test. BBB integrity was evaluated using Evans blue staining, and protein expression levels were analyzed via ELISA, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In vitro experiments revealed that XXD-containing serum, when cultured for 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h, could upregulate the expression of P-gp mRNA and protein, downregulate CB1 protein expression, and upregulate CB2 and Mfsd2a protein expression. In vivo studies demonstrated that XXD improved spatial learning and memory abilities in SAMP8 mice, reduced the amount of Evans blue extravasation in brain tissues, modulated the BBB-associated P-gp/ECS axis, RAGE/LRP1 receptor system, as well as MRP2 and Mfsd2a proteins, and decreased the accumulation of A\u03b2 in the brains of SAMP8 mice. Additionally, XXD upregulated the expression of TREM2, downregulated IBA1, TLR1, TLR2, and CMPK2 expression, and reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory factors NLRP3, NF-\u03baB p65, COX-2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in the hippocampal tissues. CONCLUSION: XXD may exert its effects by regulating the P-gp/ECS axis, the RAGE/LRP1 receptor system, and the expression of MRP2 and Mfsd2a proteins, thereby modulating the transport function of the BBB to expedite the clearance of A\u03b2, reduce cerebral A\u03b2 accumulation, and consequently inhibit the activation of microglia induced by A\u03b2 aggregation. This process may suppress the activation of the CMPK2/NLRP3 and TLRs/NF-\u03baB pathways, diminish the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, alleviate neuroinflammation associated with microglia in the brain of AD, and ultimately improve AD pathology.",

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE OF THE REPORT: Adults with Down Syndrome (DS) have a substantially increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to the triplicated amyloid-precursor-protein gene on chromosome 21, resulting in amyloid and tau accumulation. However, tau PET assessments are not sufficiently implemented in DS-AD research or clinical work-up, and second-generation tau tracers such as [18F]PI-2620 have not been thoroughly characterized in adults with DS. We aim at illustrating feasibility and potential diagnostic value of tau PET imaging with [18F]PI-2620 for the diagnosis of DS-AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five adults with DS (40% female, aged 43-62) and cognitive decline underwent clinical assessments, neuropsychological testing, lumbar puncture and multimodal neuroimaging. All underwent [18F]PI-2620 tau PET. Visual read of tau PET scans was performed by three blinded raters, assessing increased tracer uptake in brain areas corresponding to the six Braak stage regions and basal ganglia. RESULTS: Visual read of tau burden revealed three tau-positive individuals which corresponded to their clinical decline while two cognitively stable individuals were rated as negative. Rating showed high inter-rater reliability for all Braak stages. CONCLUSION: Tau PET imaging is a feasible and important biomarker assessment in the differential diagnosis of cognitive decline in adults with DS at risk of developing AD.",

METHOD: To elucidate shared pathophysiological mechanisms between insomnia and AD/PD, we performed comprehensive two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, investigating 1,400 serum metabolic characteristics for their causal relationships with the risks of insomnia, AD, widely defined AD (WDAD), and PD. We employed publicly available genetic data; the primary estimate was determined using inverse-variance weighting, supplemented by weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode, and the MR-PRESSO and MR-Egger methods to evaluate heterogeneity and pleiotropy. RESULTS: The ratio of N-palmitoyl-sphingosine to N-palmitoyl-sphinganine is linked to higher risks of insomnia (OR = 1.137, 95% CI = 1.015-1.273, p\u202f=\u202f0.026) and AD (OR = 1.090, 95% CI = 1.005-1.183, p\u202f=\u202f0.037).

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: As a clinical precursor to Alzheimer's disease (AD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) bears a considerably heightened risk of transitioning to AD compared to cognitively normal elders. Early prediction of whether aMCI will progress to AD is of paramount importance, as it can provide pivotal guidance for subsequent clinical interventions in an early and effective manner. METHODS: A total of 107 aMCI cases were enrolled and their electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected at the time of the initial diagnosis. During 18-month follow-up period, 42 individuals progressed to AD (PMCI), while 65 remained in the aMCI stage (SMCI). Spectral, nonlinear, and functional connectivity features were extracted from the EEG data, subjected to feature selection and dimensionality reduction, and then fed into various machine learning classifiers for discrimination. The performance of each model was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated in terms of accuracy (ACC), area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), and F1-score. RESULTS: Compared to SMCI patients, PMCI patients exhibit a trend of \"high to low\" frequency shift, decreased complexity, and a disconnection phenomenon in EEG signals. An epoch-based classification procedure, utilizing the extracted EEG features and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, achieved the ACC of 99.96%, AUC of 99.97%, SEN of 99.98%, SPE of 99.95%, PPV of 99.93%, and F1-score of 99.96%. Meanwhile, the subject-based classification procedure also demonstrated commendable performance, achieving an ACC of 78.37%, an AUC of 83.89%, SEN of 77.68%, SPE of 76.24%, PPV of 82.55%, and F1-score of 78.47%. CONCLUSION: Aiming to explore the EEG biomarkers with predictive value for AD in the early stages of aMCI, the proposed discriminant framework provided robust longitudinal evidence for the trajectory of the aMCI cases, aiding in the achievement of early diagnosis and proactive intervention.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association of rest and activity rhythm with cognitive performance in older people with cognitive complaints and less education. METHODS: Activity rhythm was evaluated with wrist actigraphy in 109 community-dwelling older people with cognitive complaints without diagnosed dementia. Each participant completed a neuropsychological battery and was classified as having cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, or normal cognition. We used adjusted multinomial logistic regression and linear regression models to compare sleep and circadian non-parametric measures with cognitive groups and cognitive z-scores, respectively. RESULTS: The mean age of the 109 participants was 79.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.3 years old, 74% were women, 68% were white, and the mean education was 5.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 years. Daytime activity intensity was associated with better language (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.178; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.022, 0.334; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and visuospatial performance (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.158; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.008, 0.308; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Also, less fragmented rhythm was associated with better visuospatial (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.172; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.025, 0.320; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and global cognitive scores (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.134; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.005, 0.263; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and cognitive impairment (CI). The: Cysteine-X-cysteine chemokine ligand 12(CXCL12)/CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)/CXC chemokine receptor type 7 (CXCR7) axis has emerged as a critical molecular pathway in the development of CI in these disorders. This review explores the role of this axis in the pathogenesis of CI across these neurodegenerative diseases, synthesizing current evidence and its implications for targeted therapies. In AD, dysregulation of this axis contributes to amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation, leading to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. PD studies reveal that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling influences dopaminergic neuron survival and microglial activation, affecting cognitive function. In MS, the axis modulates neuroinflammation and demyelination processes, impacting cognitive performance. ALS research indicates that the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 pathway is involved in motor neuron degeneration and associated cognitive deficits. Across these diseases, the axis influences neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival through various signaling cascades, including PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and JAK/STAT pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that modulating this axis could provide neuroprotective effects and potentially alleviate cognitive symptoms. This review highlights the potential of the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 axis as a therapeutic target for addressing CI in neurodegenerative diseases. It also underscores the need for further research to fully elucidate its role and develop effective interventions, potentially leading to improved clinical management strategies for these devastating disorders.",

This study aimed to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying AD in elderly patients compared with healthy aged individuals using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and next-generation knowledge discovery methods (NGKD), with a focus on identifying potential therapeutic agents. METHODS: High-throughput RNA-seq data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number: GSE104704). These data were derived from healthy and diseased human brains (eight young healthy brains [young], 10 aged healthy brains [Old], and 12 aged diseased brains [AD]). We used NGKD tools such as GEO RNA-seq Experiments Interactive Navigator (GREIN) to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by comparing the AD versus Old RNA-seq data and further filtered and normalized to obtain differentially regulated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome and Panther pathways using ExpressAnalyst tool. Besides, WebGestalt was used to identify differentially regulated Gene Ontologies (GO) and the pre-ranked Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using GSEA software. The X2K web tool was used to infer upstream regulator networks and X2K Appyter tool for obtaining transcription factors (TFs) and kinase network information. LFW1000 and L1000CDS2 tools were used to identify specific drugs that reverse AD-associated gene signatures in elderly patients. RESULTS: Our study revealed significant downregulation of pathways related to neuroactive receptor-ligand interaction, synaptic vesicle cycle, and neuronal system in elderly individuals with AD. GO analysis showed negative enrichment of functions related to cognition, potassium ion transport, receptor-ligand activity, SNARE binding, and primary lysosomes. The transcription factors SUZ12 and REST, along with increased MAPK signaling, were identified as key regulators of downregulated genes. Several drugs and natural products, including dihydroergocristine, mepacrine, gedunin, amlodipine, and disulfiram have been identified as potential therapeutic agents for reversing AD-associated gene signatures. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis of AD in elderly individuals using RNA-seq data and NGKD tools revealed multiple differentially regulated pathways, gene signatures, and potential drugs for dementia treatment. These findings highlight the complex molecular mechanisms underlying AD and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies. Further research is needed to validate these findings and to develop personalized treatment approaches for AD in elderly patients.",

However, the window of opportunity for successful sleep-targeted interventions, regarding the reduction in pathological hallmarks and related cognitive performance, remains poorly characterized. METHODS: Here, we enhanced slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep via sodium oxybate (SO) oral administration for 2 weeks at early (6\u202fmonths old) or moderately late (11\u202fmonths old) disease stages in Tg2576 mice and evaluated resulting neuropathology and behavioral performance. RESULTS: We observed that the cognitive performance of 6-month-old Tg2576 mice significantly improved upon SO treatment, whereas no change was observed in 11-month-old mice. Histochemical assessment of amyloid plaques demonstrated that SO-treated 11-month-old Tg2576 mice had significantly less plaque burden than placebo-treated ones, whereas ELISA of insoluble protein fractions from brains of 6-month-old Tg2576 mice indicated lower A\u03b2-42/A\u03b2-40 ratio in SO-treated group vs. placebo-treated controls. DISCUSSION: Altogether, our results suggest that SWA-dependent reduction in brain amyloidosis leads to alleviated behavioral impairment in Tg2576 mice only if administered early in the disease course, potentially highlighting the key importance of early sleep-based interventions in clinical cohorts.",

Methylglyoxal (MG) is recognized as the primary precursor of AGEs. Methylglyoxal is produced endogenously and also introduced through dietary exposures. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate and compare the effects of aminoguanidine (AG), semicarbazide (SC), and thiosemicarbazide (TSC) on MG-induced neurological toxicity in rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were exposed orally to MG, MG + AG, MG + SC, and MG + TSC for 70 days. Neurobehavioral, biochemical, and histopathological changes were evaluated. RESULTS: The findings indicated that oral administration of MG for 70 days resulted in memory impairment and increased anxiety in neurobehavioral tests. Additionally, MG elevated protein carbonylation in brain tissues. Semicarbazide was found to prevent MG-induced memory problems, while both SC and AG reduced carbonyl content in brain tissues. Aminoguanidine and TSC were effective in alleviating anxiety induced by MG exposure. Histopathological analysis revealed that MG caused cell damage and neuronal necrosis in the hippocampus, particularly in the cornu ammonis 1 and 3 (CA1 and CA3) and AG, SC, and TSC improved neuronal survival specifically in the CA1 and DG areas. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that SC, AG, and TSC may offer neuroprotective effects against MG-induced neurobehavioral toxicity.

High-dose aducanumab (10 mg/kg) demonstrated significant improvements in some studies but not others. Adverse events, notably amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), were frequent, especially at higher doses. The studies exhibited heterogeneous treatment effects and underscored the potential of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers as an alternative to amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\u00a0Aducanumab shows promise in reducing A\u03b2 plaques and has potential clinical benefits at high doses; however, its safety profile, particularly concerning ARIA, remains a significant concern. The variability in clinical efficacy highlights the need for further research to optimize dosing regimens and identify patient populations most likely to benefit from treatment. Future studies should focus on refining treatment protocols and exploring alternative biomarkers to improve therapeutic outcomes for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Recent research revealed that Tau plays critical roles in various neuronal functions. We previously demonstrated that destabilization and nuclear delocalization of Tau alter the expression of glutamatergic genes, mediating early neuronal damage. METHODS: In this study, we discovered that changes in Tau availability are linked to global alterations in gene expression that affect multiple neuronal pathways. Comparison with the human temporal region showed that the Tau-dependent modulation of gene expression closely resembles the intermediate stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that precede the definitive pathological condition. RESULTS: Furthermore, we identified the chromatin remodeling pathway as being significantly affected by Tau in both our cellular model and AD brains, with reductions in heterochromatin markers. Our findings indicate that Tau is able to globally affect the neuronal transcriptome and that its subcellular unbalance changes gene expression in the intermediate stages of AD development. In addition, we found that the chromatin architecture is affected by Tau during the progression of AD. DISCUSSION: These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying early stages of AD development and highlight the central role of Tau and the contribution of nuclear Tau in this process.",

These highly ordered, cross-\u03b2-sheet protein aggregates are found across all domains of life, playing crucial physiological roles. In bacteria, functional amyloids like curli fibers are essential for surface adhesion, biofilm formation, and viral DNA packaging. Fungal prions exploit amyloid conformations to regulate translation, metabolism, and virulence, while mammalian amyloids are integral to melanin synthesis, hormone storage, and antimicrobial defense. The stability and hydrophobic nature of amyloid scaffolds underpin these diverse biological functions. Beyond their natural roles, amyloid fibrils offer unique capabilities in biomedicine, nanotechnology, and materials science. Their exceptional mechanical strength and biocompatibility make them ideal for controlled drug delivery, tissue engineering scaffolds, and enzyme immobilization. The intrinsic fluorescence and optical properties of certain amyloids open up innovative applications in biosensors, molecular probes, and optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, amyloid fibrils can template metal nanowires, enhance conducting materials, and form nanocomposites by integrating with polymers. This newfound appreciation for the functional diversity of amyloids has ignited intense research efforts to elucidate their molecular mechanisms, stability, and tunable properties. By unraveling the structural intricacies of functional amyloids, researchers aim to harness their remarkable attributes for groundbreaking biomedical therapies, advanced nanomaterials, and sustainable biotechnological innovations.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia. Treatments for AD do not reverse the loss of brain function; rather, they decrease the rate of cognitive deterioration. Current treatments are ineffective in part because they do not address neurotrophic mechanisms, which are believed to be critical for functional recovery. Given that structural losses are assumed to be the root cause of cognitive impairment in AD, strengthening neurotrophic pathways may be a useful preventative therapeutic approach. Insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2), which is widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), has emerged as a crucial mechanism of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, and many studies have indicated that this neurotrophic peptide is a viable candidate for treating and preventing AD-induced cognitive decline. An increase in IGF2 levels improves memory in healthy animals and alleviates several symptoms associated with neurodegenerative disorders. These effects are primarily caused by the IGF2 receptor, which is widely expressed in neurons and controls protein trafficking, synthesis, and degradation. However, the use of IGF2 as a potential target for the development of novel pharmaceuticals to treat AD-induced memory impairment needs further investigation. We compiled recent studies on the role of IGF2 in AD-associated memory issues and summarized the current knowledge regarding IGF2 expression and function in the brain, specifically in AD-induced memory impairment.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, and neuroprotection is an important approach to improving AD outcomes. Rhizoma of Anemarrhena asphodeloides (RAA) is a commonly used Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with demonstrated neuroprotective effects, but its anti-AD mechanism requires further exploration. AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate the neuroprotective mechanism of RAA on TMT-induced AD mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AD mice model was established via intraperitoneal injection of TMT. The effect of RAA on ameliorating learning and memory was assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests. Haematoxylin-Eosin (HE), Nissl, and TUNEL staining were used to observe the neuroprotective effect of RAA. The components in serum containing RAA (RAA-S) were detected using UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS. Potential targets were predicted through network pharmacology and molecular docking. Serum levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured with ELISA kits. The HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell line injured by l-glutamate (L-Glu) was used to further elucidate the mechanism of RAA. ROS levels in HT22\u00a0cells were detected with the 2'-7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescent probe and flow cytometry. Apoptosis in HT22\u00a0cells was measured by flow cytometry. The proteins MAP2, GAP-43, Nrf2, Keap1, HO-1, Bax, and Bcl-2 were detected by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence staining was employed to observe Nrf2 nuclear translocation. RESULTS: RAA significantly increased the residence time of mice in the W zone and enhanced the correct alternation rate in TMT-treated mice. RAA preserved the integrity and orderly arrangement of nerve cells. A total of 12 components were detected in RAA-S. AKT1, PPARG, CASP3, STAT3, HSP90AA1, and NFE2L2 (Nrf2) were involved in the RAA-S target pathway network. Molecular docking revealed that Nrf2 exhibited the highest average binding energy with all components in RAA-S. In vivo, RAA elevated MAP2, GAP-43, Nrf2, and HO-1 levels, along with GPx, GSH, and SOD activity, which had been reduced by TMT. Additionally, RAA reduced serum levels of MDA and ROS, which had been elevated by TMT. In vitro, RAA-S reduced HT22\u00a0cell apoptosis and ROS accumulation caused by TMT. Furthermore, RAA-S promoted the expression of N-Nrf2 and HO-1 in L-Glu-injured HT22\u00a0cells. CONCLUSION: RAA attenuated oxidative stress induced by TMT and L-Glu in AD model mice. The underlying mechanism was associated with the activation of the Nrf2/Keap1-HO-1 pathway.",

Despite various treatment strategies aimed at alleviating symptoms, treatments remain elusive and ineffective due to the disease's complexity. However, recent advancements in gene therapy via the CRISPR-Cas system offer ground-breaking and targeted treatment options. Based on a bacterial immune mechanism, the CRISPR-Cas system enables precise genome editing, allowing for the alteration of different genetic mutations and the possible cure of genetic diseases. In the context of neurological disorders, the CRISPR-Cas system shows a promising avenue by allowing researchers to conduct genome-editing which is implicated in neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. This book chapter provides an updated overview of the application of the CRISPR-Cas system for addressing target-specific therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the principles of the CRISPR-Cas mechanism, its role in modeling neurological disorders, identifying molecular targets, and developing gene-based therapies. Additionally, the chapter explores the recent clinical trials and CRISPR-Cas-mediated treatments for neurological conditions. By leveraging the accuracy and versatility of the CRISPR-Cas system, scientists can more effectively handle the genetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases.

In addition to its utility in Alzheimer's diagnosis and treatment, the ATN framework may also have clinical relevance in identifying non-Alzheimer's pathologies. In this study conducted at Broadlawns Geriatric and Memory Center, 92 amyloid-negative profiles out of 182 patients with an ATN framework were categorized into subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (non-amnestic MCI), amnestic MCI, Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, mixed dementia, unspecified dementia, or other memory changes based on diagnoses written in the chart. Additionally, other secondary diagnoses were found in the differential, including sleep disorders, anxiety, depressive disorders and grief, and cerebrovascular disease. The results are concordant with our expectations that amyloid-negative ATN profiles are associated with mostly non-Alzheimer's cognitive decline. We were also able to demonstrate that amyloid-negative patients have other secondary neurologic or psychiatric diagnoses related to memory or cognitive changes. However, certain enigmatic patient presentations warrant further scrutiny in the medical chart. It is possible that ATN may pose a risk of misclassification in both Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer pathologies, particularly at early stages. Future work may be required to corroborate findings using other new plasma biomarkers, such as p-Tau217. Overall, we hope that this study will provide options for early detection and future treatment of AD and other neurocognitive disorders. We also anticipate that this work will lead to the recognition of other non-neurocognitive conditions comorbid with such neurocognitive disorders.",

One example is testing of Haitian Creole speaking adults who are increasingly affected by Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, for whom few tests have been validated. AIMS: Our purpose is to describe differences in timed test performance between Haitian Creole and English-speaking participants and explore factors that may account for any differences in results found. METHODS: Data was obtained from an ongoing longitudinal driving and cognition study \"In Vehicle Sensors to Detect Cognitive Change in Older Drivers.\" Two groups consisting of 12 Creole speaking and 12 English speaking older adults were matched by age and gender. Test scores were selected from the battery of tests administered in the parent study. The measures were translated by two bilingual Creole-English researchers. Group performance on five timed cognitive tests commonly used in research was compared. RESULTS: The English-speaking group's mean scores were significantly higher than the Creole speaking group on the MoCA and the timed Animal category fluency, letter P fluency, Stroop Color Test, and Trail Making Test A and B. The most significant effects were noted in Letter P fluency, Trail Making Test A and B and Animal category fluency where the differences had large effect sizes. However, the Creole speaking group had higher mean scores than the English-Speaking group on the Stroop Color Word Test, although the difference was not statistically significant. It was not feasible to match education levels due to the differences in years of education across the groups. These results highlight the significant role of culture and linguistic context in cognitive task performance. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest performance in cognitive testing among non-English speaking groups may be impacted by cultural factors related to time perception and the testing approach employed, leading to misinterpretation and misdiagnosis. Future studies should explore the fairness of various cognitive testing approaches with Haitian older adults and other societies with cultures and educational approaches different from those of Western cultures.",

The present study sought to investigate preventive effects of EpoD on altered changes of MT related proteins and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins induced by social defeat stress (SDS). METHODS: We measured protein expression levels of \u03b1-tubulin and its post-translational modifications, MT-associated protein 2, stathmin1 and 2 with their phosphorylated forms, and ER stress markers, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP-78) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-homologous protein (CHOP) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP) of C57BL/6J strain mice treated with EpoD (2 mg/kg) or its vehicle, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and exposed to SDS. RESULTS: We observed lower levels of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin, MAP2, p-STMN (Ser16), and GRP-78 in the PFC of the EpoD-Con group when compared to the DMSO-Con group. On the other hand, in the HIP, there were significantly higher levels of tyrosinated \u03b1-tubulin and GRP-78 in the EpoD-Defeat group compared to the DMSO-Defeat group. Furthermore, the level of MAP2 in the HIP was found to be lower in the EpoD-Con group compared to the DMSO-Con group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that EpoD exhibits a dual impact, manifesting both beneficial and detrimental effects on the aberrant changes of MT-related proteins and ER stress proteins induced by SDS, depending on the brain regions. These findings underscore the complexity of EpoD's effects, necessitating further exploration to understand its intricate mechanisms in cellular pathways linked to SDS.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus are both cytoarchitectonically heterogeneous regions. Specifically, the retrosplenial cortex, typically subsumed under the posterior cingulate cortex, is an area functionally and anatomically distinct from the posterior cingulate cortex, and the hippocampus is composed of several subregions that participate in multiple cognitive processes. However, little is known about the functional connectivity patterns of the retrosplenial cortex or other parts of the posterior cingulate cortex with hippocampal subregions and their differential vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Demographic data, neuropsychological assessments, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 60 Alzheimer's disease participants, 60 participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and 60 sex-matched normal controls. The bilateral retrosplenial cortex, other parts of the posterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus subregions (including the bilateral anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus) were selected to investigate functional connectivity alterations in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis demonstrated heterogeneity in the degree of connectivity between the hippocampus and different parts of the total posterior cingulate cortex, with considerably greater functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex with the hippocampus compared with other parts of the posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, the bilateral retrosplenial cortex exhibited widespread intrinsic functional connectivity with all anterior-posterior hippocampus subregions. Compared to the normal controls, the amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease groups showed different magnitudes of decreased functional connectivity between the retrosplenial cortex and the contralateral posterior hippocampus. Additionally, diminished functional connectivity between the left retrosplenial cortex and right posterior hippocampus was correlated with clinical disease severity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment subjects, and the combination of multiple functional connectivity indicators of the retrosplenial cortex can discriminate the three groups from each other. These findings confirm and extend previous studies suggesting that the retrosplenial cortex is extensively and functionally connected with hippocampus subregions and that these functional connections are selectively affected in the Alzheimer's disease continuum, with prominent disruptions in functional connectivity between the retrosplenial cortex and contralateral posterior hippocampus underpinning episodic memory impairment associated with the disease.",

The analysis of the resulting data poses significant challenges, and proper statistical methods are required to analyze and extract information from scRNA-Seq datasets. Sample classification based on gene expression data has proven effective and valuable for precision medicine applications. However, standard classification schemas are often not suitable for scRNA-Seq due to their unique characteristics, and new algorithms are required to effectively analyze and classify samples at the single-cell level. Furthermore, existing methods for this purpose have limitations in their usability. Those reasons motivated us to develop singleDeep, an end-to-end pipeline that streamlines the analysis of scRNA-Seq data training deep neural networks, enabling robust prediction and characterization of sample phenotypes. We used singleDeep to make predictions on scRNA-Seq datasets from different conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease and coronavirus disease 2019. Our results demonstrate strong diagnostic performance, validated both internally and externally. Moreover, singleDeep outperformed traditional machine learning methods and alternative single-cell approaches. In addition to prediction accuracy, singleDeep provides valuable insights into cell types and gene importance estimation for phenotypic characterization. This functionality provided additional and valuable information in our use cases. For instance, we corroborated that some interferon signature genes are consistently relevant for autoimmunity across all immune cell types in lupus.

The main reason for that change arises from the different biological behavior of humans that leads to frequent failure of translating data from bench to bed.

In this review, we make a critical appraisal of the advantages and limitations of studying Alzheimer\u00b4s disease in brain cortical organoids derived from inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). While dealing with human neurons and glia in 3D poses a tremendous advantage versus murine brain cells, organoids typically lack microglia, blood vessels, immune interactions as well as proper CNS neuropil. In turn, they have relatively few oligodendrocytes and low myelination. In addition, lengthy procedures to get proper mature organoids constitute an additional limitation that may also affect the native biological properties of neurons and glia.

To take advantage of this treatment window, we need to make rapid progress in early detection and monitoring, targeted implementation of preventative measures, invention of novel therapeutics, and pragmatic ramping-up of relevant supporting policies. PET is a powerful tool for prognosis. The utilization of AI technology, on the other hand, has favorable features of low cost per capita, easy dissemination and broad scale data collection to uncover previously unknown hotspots or risk factors. FDA approved drugs, lecanemab and donanemab, have started to show efficacy to put a pause on AD progression. Additional clinical data will enable comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of these drugs. Gene therapy holds the potential of eliciting long term protection, while several candidate loci have been identified. The urgency of a tsunami of rising AD epidemiology demands rapid actions on all fronts of advanced diagnostics, monitoring, preventative and interventive strategies.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia, is associated with significant respiratory dysfunctions. Our study explores the role of astrogliosis in the brainstem retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a key breathing regulatory center, and its impact on breathing control and AD pathology in mice. Using Tg-2576 AD and wild-type mice, we investigated the effect of silencing the transforming growth factor-beta receptor II (TGF\u03b2R II) in the RTN. We performed behavioral tests, including the Barnes maze and novel object recognition test, along with whole-body plethysmography to assess breathing disorders. Our results showed that AD mice exhibited increased apneas and cognitive impairment, which were significantly mitigated following TGF\u03b2R II gene silencing. Immunohistochemistry revealed elevated levels of GFAP and TGF\u03b2R II in the RTN of AD mice, which were reduced post-gene silencing, alongside a decrease in amyloid-beta expression in the cortex and hippocampus. These findings suggest that targeting astrogliosis and improving respiratory control may offer a novel therapeutic avenue for managing Alzheimer's disease. Our study provides the first mechanistic insights into how TGF\u03b2 signaling influences both respiratory control and AD pathogenesis, highlighting the potential benefits of stabilizing breathing patterns in AD treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Autophagy in microglia is essential for the clearance of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease. However, reports regarding the levels of autophagy in microglia have been inconsistent; some studies indicate an early enhancement followed by a subsequent reduction, while others describe a persistently weakened state. Notably, there is a lack of systematic studies documenting the temporal changes in microglial autophagy. TBC1D15, a Rab GTPase, plays a crucial role in lysosomal membrane repair, yet its function in regulating microglial autophagy in Alzheimer's disease remains unexplored. Current research suggests that microglial autophagy is activated in 3-month-old AD mice but gradually decreases by 12 months of age. Furthermore, TBC1D15 levels are significantly elevated in the lysosomes of microglia in Alzheimer's disease. Silencing TBC1D15 markedly inhibits swelling and A\u03b2 phagocytosis in BV2 cells following A\u03b2 treatment while simultaneously promoting autophagy and lysophagy. LIMP II/ATG8-TBC1D15-Dynamin2/RAB7 might participate in lysosome swelling of microglia in AD. These findings indicate that TBC1D15 in microglia is critical for the decline of autophagy in Alzheimer's disease. It is suggested that targeting microglial TBC1D15 may be an important strategy for enhancing autophagy, which facilitates the clearance of amyloid plaques as a therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.",

The aim of this study is to determine the impact of apathy on the patient's quality of life (QoL) and caregiver's burden among PwD. METHODS: Sample of this cross-sectional descriptive study consisted of 88 PwD attending the outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Istanbul and their family caregivers. The evaluation battery included Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 73.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911.7, and the time since diagnosis was 3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1 years; 64.8% had Alzheimer's type dementia, and 53.4% (n\u2009=\u200947) had mild dementia.

        "AbstractText": "Linezolid, a widely used oxazolidinone antibiotic, exhibits potent activity against resistant bacterial infections but is associated with serotonergic toxicity, primarily due to its inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO). MAOs, consisting of MAO-A and MAO-B isoforms, play crucial roles in neurotransmitter metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. This study aims to optimize Linezolid's structure to transform it into a selective MAO-B inhibitor. Utilizing structure-activity and structure-toxicity relationship approaches, novel analogues of Linezolid were synthesized by replacing its oxazolidinone ring with a thiadiazole scaffold. Among the synthesized compounds, 6b emerged as a lead candidate, displaying a remarkable MAO-B inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.03 \u03bcM) and 464-fold selectivity over MAO-A, compared to the standard drugs Pargyline (IC50 = 0.14 \u03bcM) and Clorgyline (IC50 = 1.85 \u03bcM). Furthermore, docking and molecular dynamics simulations corroborated the high affinity and stability of compound 6b in the MAO-B enzyme's binding pocket. These findings suggest that optimized Linezolid analogues, particularly compound 6b, hold promise as selective MAO-B inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases while avoiding the risks associated with serotonergic toxicity.",

        "AbstractText": "Due to the tremendous heterogeneity of disease manifestations, many complex diseases that were once thought to be single diseases are now considered to have disease subtypes. Disease subtyping analysis, that is the identification of subgroups of patients with similar characteristics, is the first step to accomplish precision medicine. With the advancement of high-throughput technologies, omics data offers unprecedented opportunity to reveal disease subtypes. As a result, unsupervised clustering analysis has been widely used for this purpose. Though promising, the subtypes obtained from traditional quantitative approaches may not always be clinically meaningful (i.e. correlate with clinical outcomes). On the other hand, the collection of rich clinical data in modern epidemiology studies has the great potential to facilitate the disease subtyping process via omics data and to discovery clinically meaningful disease subtypes. Thus, we developed an outcome-guided Bayesian clustering (GuidedBayesianClustering) method to fully integrate the clinical data and the high-dimensional omics data. A Gaussian mixed model framework was applied to perform sample clustering; a spike-and-slab prior was utilized to perform gene selection; a mixture model prior was employed to incorporate the guidance from a clinical outcome variable; and a decision framework was adopted to infer the false discovery rate of the selected genes. We deployed conjugate priors to facilitate efficient Gibbs sampling. Our proposed full Bayesian method is capable of simultaneously (i) obtaining sample clustering (disease subtype discovery); (ii) performing feature selection (select genes related to the disease subtype); and (iii) utilizing clinical outcome variable to guide the disease subtype discovery. The superior performance of the GuidedBayesianClustering was demonstrated through simulations and applications of breast cancer expression data and Alzheimer's disease. An R package has been made publicly available on GitHub to improve the applicability of our method.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Tau protein plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in regulating neuronal excitability. Among tau-coding microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene mutations, the A152T mutation is reported to increase the risk of AD and neuronal excitability in mouse models. METHODS: To investigate the effects of MAPT gene expression and its mutations on neuronal activity in human neurons, we employed genome editing technology to introduce the A152T or P301S mutations into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We then differentiated them into excitatory and inhibitory neurons. As a control, iPSCs in which the MAPT gene was replaced with a fluorescent protein were also created. RESULTS: In excitatory neuronal cultures, the A152T mutation was found to enhance spontaneous neuronal activity and the association of tau and Fyn. However, in inhibitory neuron-enriched cultures, the A152T mutation did not affect neuronal activity. Inhibition of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) and the reduction of tau protein levels decreased neuronal excitability in both A152T/A152T and healthy control (WT/WT) excitatory neurons. In addition, the A152T mutation increased the interaction between tau and Fyn. These findings suggest that the tau-Fyn interaction plays a critical role in regulating neuronal activity under physiological conditions, while the A152T mutation enhances neuronal activity by strengthening this endogenous interaction between tau and Fyn. In addition, transcriptomic analysis revealed structural changes specific to excitatory neurons with the A152T mutation. Common changes observed in both A152T and P301S lines recapitulated a dedifferentiation phenotype, consistent with previous reports. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the A152T mutation in the MAPT gene increases neuronal excitability through the tau-Fyn-NMDAR pathway in excitatory neurons, shedding light on its role in AD pathogenesis.",

Current medications target Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent form of dementia. This study investigated Juniperus phoenicea L., a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine, as a potential inhibitor of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), an enzyme associated with dementia. METHODS: J.\u00a0phoenicea phytochemicals were subjected to in silico docking against PPT1 (PDB ID: 1EH5). Docking simulations were performed in YASARA Structure with VINA scoring. Top-ranked ligands were subjected to ADMET analysis (admetlab 2.0, Protox 3.0) and PASS bioactivity prediction. Stability and reactivity were analyzed with DFT calculations (Gaussian 09), and 500 ns MD simulations (YASARA Structure, AMBER 14 force field) to assess protein-ligand complex stability. MM-PBSA was used to calculate binding free energies. RESULTS: The docking simulations identified amentoflavone (-9.6\u00a0kcal/mol) as the top hit, followed by ferruginol and quercetin 3-O-pentoside. Amentoflavone formed the most interactions (19) with PPT1. In silico toxicity analysis predicted amentoflavone and quercetin 3-O-pentoside to be safe, whereas ferruginol violated the Pfizer rule. The PASS server indicated a higher probability of activity for quercetin 3-O-pentoside (0.423) than amentoflavone (0.287) for dementia treatment. DFT calculations revealed similar electronic properties for both ligands, although amentoflavone showed slightly more favorable values. MD simulations demonstrated that amentoflavone, compared with to galantamine, had superior binding stability in the PPT1 binding pocket. CONCLUSION: This in silico study was aimed at identifying potential inhibitors of PPT1 from J.\u00a0phoenicea phytochemicals, given that PPT1 is a target for developing new dementia medications. Our findings identified amentoflavone as a promising candidate for further investigation.

In recent years, it has shown great potential, particularly in the treatment of locomotor system diseases. Studies have shown that ligustilide has significant therapeutic effects on various locomotor system diseases, including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, femoral head necrosis, osteosarcoma, and muscle aging and injury. Its mechanisms of action include enhancing the differentiation ability of osteoblasts(OBs), inhibiting the formation ability of osteoclasts(OCs), downregulating inflammatory factors, promoting the synthesis of extracellular matrix(ECM), improving local blood supply to the femoral head, balancing lipid metabolism, inhibiting the proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma cells, inducing cell cycle arrest, enhancing glucose utilization in skeletal muscle, and regulating autophagy and apoptosis.

Herein, we reported ultrasmall coordination polymer nanoparticles formed by ferric ions and gallic acid (Fe-GA CPNs), which owned antioxidant and anti-inflammation properties for AD therapeutics.

Changes to cellular lipids often accompany shifts in microglial cell state, but the functional significance of these metabolic changes remains poorly understood. In human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, we observed that both extrinsic activation (by lipopolysaccharide treatment) and intrinsic triggers (the Alzheimer's disease-associated APOE4 genotype) result in accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipid droplets. We demonstrate that lipid droplet accumulation is not simply concomitant with changes in cell state but rather necessary for microglial activation. We discovered that both triglyceride biosynthesis and catabolism are needed for the transcription and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to extrinsic stimuli. Additionally, we reveal that triglyceride biosynthesis and catabolism are necessary for the activation-associated phagocytosis of multiple substrates including the disease-associated amyloid-beta peptide. In microglia harboring the Alzheimer's disease risk APOE4 genotype, triglyceride-rich lipid droplets accumulate even in the absence of any external stimuli. Inhibiting triglyceride biosynthesis in APOE4 microglia not only modifies the transcription of immune response genes but also attenuates disease-associated transcriptional states. This work establishes that triglyceride metabolism is necessary for microglia to respond to extrinsic activation. In APOE4 microglia, this metabolic process modulates both immune signaling and a disease-associated transcriptional state. Importantly, our work identifies metabolic pathways that can be used to tune microglial immunometabolism in APOE4- associated disease.",

The interplay between the intestinal microbiota and metabolites is believed to influence brain function and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions through the microbe-gut-brain axis. Sika deer antler protein possesses neuroprotective properties; however, the precise mechanism by which it improves AD remains unclear. Sika deer antler protein ameliorated AD in\u00a0vivo by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. The metabolome of brain and intestinal tissues and the microbiota of intestinal contents were tested and analyzed according to the microbe-gut-brain theory. Sika deer antler protein increased beneficial bacterial levels and decreased harmful bacterial levels. Correlation analyses using the gut flora-metabolomics pathway ultimately revealed that sika deer antler protein modulated the brain and intestinal tract bi-directionally via the tyrosine metabolism pathway, thereby establishing a connection within the microbe-gut-brain axis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of the differential metabolite targets of the DAP4 group showed that the enriched pathways mainly included PI3K/AKT, which was consistent with the findings of the pharmacodynamic mechanisms observed in in\u00a0vivo experiments. This suggests that antler protein may be involved in microbe-gut-brain interactions through tyrosine metabolism and may improve AD by activating the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway.

This study introduces a deep learning framework designed to automate neuro-diagnostics, addressing the limitations of current manual interpretation methods, which are often time-consuming and prone to variability. METHODS: We propose a specialized deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) framework aimed at detecting and classifying neurological anomalies in MRI data. Our approach incorporates key preprocessing techniques, such as reducing noise and normalizing image intensity in MRI scans, alongside an optimized model architecture. The model employs Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions, the Adam optimizer, and a random search strategy to fine-tune hyper-parameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of neurons in fully connected layers. To ensure reliability and broad applicability, cross-fold validation was used. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our DCNN achieved a remarkable classification accuracy of 98.44%, surpassing well-known models such as ResNet-50 and AlexNet when evaluated on a comprehensive MRI dataset. Moreover, performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated separately, confirming the robustness and efficiency of our model across various evaluation criteria. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA and t-tests, further validated the significance of the performance improvements observed with our proposed method. This model represents an important step toward creating a fully automated system for diagnosing and planning treatment for neurological diseases. The high accuracy of our framework highlights its potential to improve diagnostic workflows by enabling precise detection, tracking disease progression, and supporting personalized treatment strategies. While the results are promising, further research is necessary to assess how the model performs across different clinical scenarios. Future studies could focus on integrating additional data types, such as longitudinal imaging and multimodal techniques, to further enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility. These findings mark a significant advancement in applying deep learning to neuro-diagnostics, with promising implications for improving patient outcomes and clinical practices.",

        "ArticleTitle": "African ancestry neurodegeneration risk variant disrupts an intronic branchpoint in GBA1.",
        "AbstractText": "Recently, a novel African ancestry specific Parkinson's disease (PD) risk signal was identified at the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (GBA1). This variant (rs3115534-G) is carried by ~50% of West African PD cases and imparts a dose-dependent increase in risk for disease. The risk variant has varied frequencies across African ancestry groups, but is almost absent in European and Asian ancestry populations. GBA1 is a gene of high clinical and therapeutic interest. Damaging bi-allelic protein-coding variants cause Gaucher disease and mono-allelic variants confer risk for PD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, likely by reducing the function of glucocerebrosidase. Interestingly, the novel African ancestry specific GBA1 risk variant is a non-coding variant, suggesting a different mechanism of action. Using full length RNA transcript sequencing, we identified intron 8 expression in risk variant carriers (G) but not in non-variant carriers (T). Antibodies targeting the N-terminus of glucocerebrosidase showed that this intron-retained isoform is likely not protein coding and subsequent proteomics did not identify a shorter protein isoform, suggesting the disease mechanism is RNA-based. CRISPR editing of the reported index variant (rs3115534) revealed that this is the responsible sequence alteration driving production of these intron 8 containing transcripts. Follow-up analysis of this variant showed that it is in a key intronic branchpoint sequence and therefore has important implications in splicing and disease. In addition, when measuring glucocerebrosidase activity we identified a dose-dependent reduction in risk variant carriers (G). Overall, we report the functional effect of a GBA1 non-coding risk variant, which acts by interfering with the splicing of functional GBA1 transcripts, resulting in reduced protein levels and reduced glucocerebrosidase activity. This understanding reveals a novel therapeutic target in an underserved and underrepresented population.",

        "AbstractText": "The chromosome 5p15.33 region, which encodes telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), harbors multiple germline variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as risk for some cancers but protective for others. We characterized a variable number tandem repeat within TERT intron 6 (VNTR6-1, 38-bp repeat unit) and observed a strong association between VNTR6-1 alleles (Short: 24-27 repeats, Long: 40.5-66.5 repeats) and GWAS signals within TERT intron 4. Specifically, VNTR6-1 fully explained the GWAS signals for rs2242652 and partially for rs10069690. VNTR6-1, rs10069690 and their haplotypes were associated with multi-cancer risk and age-related telomere shortening. Both variants reduce TERT expression through alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay: rs10069690-T increases intron 4 retention and VNTR6-1-Long expands a polymorphic G quadruplex (G4, 35-113 copies) within intron 6. Treatment with G4-stabilizing ligands decreased the fraction of the functional telomerase-encoding TERT full-length isoform, whereas CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of VNTR6-1 increased this fraction and apoptosis while reducing cell proliferation. Thus, VNTR6-1 and rs10069690 regulate the expression and splicing of TERT transcripts encoding both functional and nonfunctional telomerase. Altered TERT isoform ratios might modulate cellular longevity and replicative potential at homeostasis and in response to environmental factors, thus selectively contributing to the reduced or elevated cancer risk conferred by this locus.",

        "AbstractText": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Poor sleep may play a role in the risk of dementia. However, few studies have investigated the association between polysomnography (PSG)-derived sleep architecture and dementia incidence. We examined the relationship between sleep macro-architecture and dementia incidence across five US-based cohort studies from the Sleep and Dementia Consortium (SDC). METHODS: Percent of time spent in stages of sleep (N1, N2, N3, REM sleep), wake after sleep onset and sleep maintenance efficiency were derived from a single night home-based PSG. Dementia was ascertained in each cohort using its cohort-specific criteria. Each cohort performed Cox proportional hazard regressions for each sleep exposure and incident dementia, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, anti-depressant use, sedative use, and APOE e4 status. Results were then pooled in random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: The pooled sample comprised 4,657 participants (30% women) aged \u226560 years (mean age was 74 years at sleep assessment). There were 998 (21.4%) dementia cases (median follow-up time of 5 to 19 years). Pooled effects of the five cohorts showed no association between sleep architecture and incident dementia. When meta-analyses were restricted to the three cohorts which had dementia case ascertainment based on DSM-IV/V criteria (n=2,374), higher N3% was marginally associated with an increased risk of dementia (HR: 1.06; 95%CI: 1.00-1.12, per percent increase N3, p=0.050). CONCLUSIONS: There were no consistent associations between sleep macro-architecture measured and the risk of incident dementia. Implementing more nuanced sleep metrics remains an important next step for uncovering more about sleep-dementia associations.",

        "AbstractText": "Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) plays a pivotal role in diverse cellular processes and is implicated in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. However, large-scale identification of endogenous SUMO-1 faces challenges due to limited enrichment methods and its lower abundance compared to SUMO-2/3. Here we propose a novel combinatorial peptide strategy, combined with anti-adhesive polymer development, to enrich endogenous SUMO-1 modified peptides, revealing a comprehensive SUMOylation landscape. Utilizing phage display, we successfully identified a linear 12-mer and a cystine-linked cyclic 7-mer peptide ligand, specifically designed to target the C-terminal regions of SUMO-1 remnants. Building upon their high affinities and satisfactory complementarity, we developed the first artificial SUMO-1 enrichment materials, ultimately establishing a combinatorial peptide strategy that facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the endogenous SUMO-1 modified proteome in both cellular and tissue contexts. We successfully mapped 1312 SUMOylation sites in HeLa cells and 1365 along with 991 endogenous SUMOylation proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse brain tissues. Notably, our method uncovered a significant upregulation of SUMO-1 in AD mouse brain tissue, providing new insights into SUMOylation's role in disease. Overall, this work represents the most thorough exploration of SUMO-1 modified proteomics and offers robust tools for elucidating the roles of SUMO-1's biological significance.",

Many schools of medicine are capitalizing on the promise of these new technologies by establishing academic units to catalyze and grow research and innovation in AI/ML. At Stanford University, we have developed a successful model for an AI/ML research center with support from academic leaders, clinical departments, extramural grants, and industry partners. The Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging uses the following 4 key tactics to support AI/ML research: project-based learning opportunities that build interdisciplinary collaboration; internal grant programs that catalyze extramural funding; infrastructure that facilitates the rapid creation of large multimodal AI-ready clinical data sets; and educational and open data programs that engage the broader research community. The center is based on the premise that foundational and applied research are not in tension but instead are complementary. Solving important biomedical problems with AI/ML requires high-quality foundational team science that incorporates the knowledge and expertise of clinicians, clinician scientists, computer scientists, and data scientists. As AI/ML becomes an essential component of research and clinical care, multidisciplinary centers of excellence in AI/ML will become a key part of the scholarly portfolio of academic medical centers and will provide a foundation for the responsible, ethical, and fair implementation of AI/ML systems.",

Emerging research suggests that NP2 is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, and neuropathies. This literature review extensively analyzes NP2's role in these conditions, thereby highlighting its contributions to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurotoxic protein aggregation. In Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, NP2 is linked to amyloid-beta aggregation and dopaminergic neuron degeneration, respectively. Additionally, altered NP2 expression is observed in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, thus suggesting its involvement in synaptic dysfunction and neurotransmitter imbalance. In neuropathic pain and epilepsy, NP2 modulates the synaptic plasticity and inflammatory responses, with altered levels correlating with disease severity. Furthermore, NP2's involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) emphasizes its broad impact on neuronal health. Understanding NP2's multifaceted roles may reveal novel therapeutic targets and improve the clinical outcomes for these neurological disorders.

        "AbstractText": "We investigated semantic cognition in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia, including (i) the status of verbal and non-verbal semantic performance; and (ii) whether the semantic deficit reflects impaired semantic control. Our a priori hypothesis that individuals with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia would exhibit semantic control impairments was motivated by the anatomical overlap between the temporoparietal atrophy typically associated with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and lesions associated with post-stroke semantic aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia, which cause heteromodal semantic control impairments. We addressed the presence, type (semantic representation and semantic control; verbal and non-verbal), and progression of semantic deficits in logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia. Since most people with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia have Alzheimer's disease pathology and are part of a broader multi-dimensional phenotype space encompassing Alzheimer's disease sub-types, we compared semantic performance in logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease. Given the differences in lesion and atrophy patterns in semantic aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia versus semantic-dementia/semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia patients, our second aim was to examine atrophy patterns in people with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and typical Alzheimer's disease compared to age-matched controls. Twenty-seven patients participated in the study. People were grouped into those meeting consensus criteria for logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (N = 10) and others who may have previously satisfied definitions of logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia but had progressed with multi-domain cognitive impairments (herein referred to as 'logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia+'; N = 8). People with typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease (N = 9) were relatively preserved across verbal and non-verbal semantic assessments. Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia patients were impaired on both verbal and non-verbal semantic tasks and their impairments showed the hallmark characteristics of a semantic control deficit. Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia + patients showed effects of varying semantic control demands, positive cueing effects, and correlated performance between semantic and executive tasks. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry, comparing each of the patient groups to age-matched controls, revealed significantly reduced grey and white matter in the bilateral hippocampi and lateral temporal regions in typical Alzheimer's disease patients. The logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia group exhibited an asymmetric pattern of reduced grey and white matter intensity in the language-dominant left hemisphere, including a significant portion of the lateral and medial temporal lobe. Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia + patients demonstrated reduced grey and white matter in the left temporal lobe extending sub-cortically, anteriorly and posteriorly, as well as right temporal involvement. Our findings could aid diagnostic sub-typing of primary progressive aphasia by adopting semantic control features and offer improved clinical characterization of logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia in the trajectory of semantic decline.",

        "AbstractText": "Hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation is seen in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus from the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease onwards and has been associated with symptoms of agitation. It is hypothesized that compensatory locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system overactivity and impaired emotion regulation could underlie agitation propensity, but to our knowledge this has not previously been investigated. A better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of agitation would help the development of targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Using a sample of individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and probable mild Alzheimer's disease dementia from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (DELCODE) study cohort (N = 309, aged 67-96 years, 51% female), we assessed cross-sectional relationships between a latent factor representing the functional integrity of an affect-related executive regulation network and agitation point prevalence and severity scores. In a subsample of individuals with locus coeruleus MRI imaging data (N = 37, aged 68-93 years, 49% female), we also investigated preliminary associations between locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios (a measure of structural integrity, whole or divided into rostral, middle, and caudal thirds) and individual affect-related regulation network factor scores and agitation measures. Regression models controlled for effects of age and clinical disease severity and, for models including resting-state functional MRI connectivity variables, grey matter volume and education years. Agitation point prevalence showed a positive relationship with a latent factor representing the functional integrity (and a negative relationship with a corresponding structural measure) of the affect-related executive regulation network. Locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios were positively associated with agitation severity (but only for the rostral third, in N = 13) and negatively associated with the functional affect-related executive regulation latent factor scores. Resting-state functional connectivity between a medial prefrontal cortex region and the left amygdala was related to locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios. These findings implicate the involvement of locus coeruleus integrity and emotion dysregulation in agitation in Alzheimer's disease and support the presence of potential compensatory processes. At the neural level, there may be a dissociation between mechanisms underlying agitation risk per se and symptom severity. Further studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings, incorporating longitudinal designs, measures of autonomic function and non-linear modelling approaches to explore potential causal and context-dependent relationships across Alzheimer's disease stages.",

These CNS stressors include cerebral hypo-glucose metabolism, hyperinsulinemia, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, impairment of neuronal autophagy, hypoxic insults and neuroinflammation. This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of DAG-MAG-\u0392HB, a novel ketone diester, in mitigating these risk factors by sustaining therapeutic ketosis, independent of conventional metabolic pathways. METHODS: We evaluated the intestinal absorption of DAG-MAG-\u0392HB and the metabolic impact in human microglial cells. Utilizing the HMC3 human microglia cell line, we examined the compound's effect on cellular viability, Acetyl-CoA and ATP levels, and key metabolic enzymes under hypoglycemia. Additionally, we assessed the impact of DAG-AG-\u0392HB on inflammasome activation, mitochondrial activity, ROS levels, inflammation and phagocytic rates. RESULTS: DAG-MAG-\u0392HB showed a high rate of intestinal absorption and no cytotoxic effect. In vitro, DAG-MAG-\u0392HB enhanced cell viability, preserved morphological integrity, and maintained elevated Acetyl-CoA and ATP levels under hypoglycemic conditions.

Recent studies in animal and human models have considerably broadened our understanding of the biological properties of not only fruit vinegars but also oxymels, i.e., mixtures of vinegar and honey or sugar. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding vinegars and oxymels, with a special emphasis on their chemical composition and the mechanisms behind their biological activity and pro-health potential. The multidirectional effects of fruit vinegars and oxymels result from the synergy of different chemical compounds, including organic acids (mainly acetic acid), phenolic compounds, vitamins, minerals, and fermentation products. However, more studies are needed to understand the interactions between all the different components, not only the phenolic compounds and organic acids. In addition, more research is needed on their mechanisms of action. Although no serious side effects have been noted to date, further studies with large sample sizes are needed to understand the possible side effects of long-term fruit vinegar and oxymel use.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Parkinson's Disease Prediction: An Attention-Based Multimodal Fusion Framework Using Handwriting and Clinical Data.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases (NGD) encompass a range of progressive neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), characterised by the gradual deterioration of neuronal structure and function. This degeneration manifests as cognitive decline, movement impairment, and dementia. Our focus in this investigation is on PD, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, leading to motor disturbances. Early detection of PD is paramount for enhancing quality of life through timely intervention and tailored treatment. However, the subtle nature of initial symptoms, like slow movements, tremors, muscle rigidity, and psychological changes, often reduce daily task performance and complicate early diagnosis. METHOD: To assist medical professionals in timely diagnosis of PD, we introduce a cutting-edge Multimodal Diagnosis framework (PMMD). Based on deep learning techniques, the PMMD framework integrates imaging, handwriting, drawing, and clinical data to accurately detect PD. Notably, it incorporates cross-modal attention, a methodology previously unexplored within the area, which facilitates the modelling of interactions between different data modalities. RESULTS: The proposed method exhibited an accuracy of 96% on the independent tests set. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art models, along with an in-depth exploration of attention mechanisms, highlights the efficacy of PMMD in PD classification. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results highlight exciting new prospects for the use of handwriting as a biomarker, along with other information, for optimal model performance. PMMD's success in integrating diverse data sources through cross-modal attention underscores its potential as a robust diagnostic decision support tool for accurately diagnosing PD.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Carvacrol Essential Oil as a Neuroprotective Agent: A Review of the Study Designs and Recent Advances.",
        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative diseases were mostly perceived as diseases of ageing populations, but now-a-days, these diseases pose a threat to populations of all age groups despite significant improvements in quality of life. Almost all essential oils (EOs) have been reported to have some neuroprotective abilities and have been used as supplements for good mental health over the centuries. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of one such monoterpene phenolic EO, carvacrol (CV), that has the potential to be used as a main therapeutic intervention for neurodegenerative disorders. Three libraries, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, were explored for research studies related to the neuroprotective roles of CV. All the research articles from these libraries were sorted out, with the first article tracing back to 2009, and the latest article was published in 2024. The positive effects of CV in the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases, multiple sclerosis, ischemia, and behavioural disorders have been supported with evidence. This review not only focused on study designs and the pharmacological pathways taken by CV for neuroprotection but also focused on demographics, illustrating the trend of CV research studies in certain countries and the preferences for the use of in vitro or in vivo models in studies. Our review provides useful evidence about the neuroprotective potential of CV; however, a lack of studies was observed regarding CV encapsulation in proper dosage forms, in particular nanoparticles, which could be further explored for CV delivery to the central nervous system.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant public health issue. Despite the fact that today there are several methods of maintenance therapy, one of the most widely used methods is designed to correct the deficiency of acetylcholine. In the search for new potential inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes, eight new derivatives of 3-oxo- or 2,3-indolo-triterpenic acid conjugated with amino-quinuclidine bicyclic cores were designed and synthesized. Then, the obtained compounds were screened in Ellman's assays for their ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase enzyme, and for each of the active compounds, the type of inhibition was determined. The obtained results demonstrate the dependence of the activity on the triterpenoid structure and the type of substituents. The best activity for ursolic acid derivatives was observed for the 3-oxoamide 8, with an IC50 value of 0.43 \u00b5M, acting as a mixed-type inhibitor. In turn, for the oleanane type, the amide with an indole unit in the A ring 11 exhibited the best activity with an IC50 value of 0.47 \u00b5M (while the ursane-type analog was weakly active) and led to an uncompetitive type of inhibition. Thus, 3-amidoquinuclidine-triterpenoids conjugates could be considered novel inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase with a different mechanism of action.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of neuropsychological assessment to predict the regional brain metabolism in a cohort of patients with amnestic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) using Machine Learning algorithms. METHODS: We included 360 subjects, consisting of 186 patients with AD, 87 with bvFTD, and 87 cognitively healthy controls. All participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination and the Neuronorma battery, in addition to [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging. We trained Machine Learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and models that incorporate genetic algorithms (GAs), to predict the presence of regional hypometabolism in FDG-PET imaging based on cognitive testing results. RESULTS: The proposed models demonstrated the ability to predict hypometabolism trends with approximately 70% accuracy in key regions associated with AD and bvFTD. In addition, we showed that incorporating neuropsychological tests provided relevant information for predicting brain hypometabolism. The temporal lobe was the best-predicted region, followed by the parietal, frontal, and some areas in the occipital lobe. Diagnosis played a significant role in the estimation of hypometabolism, and several neuropsychological tests were identified as the most important predictors for different brain regions. In our experiments, classical Machine Learning models, such as support vector machines enhanced by a preliminary feature selection step using GAs outperformed ANNs. CONCLUSIONS: A successful prediction of regional brain metabolism of patients with AD and bvFTD was achieved based on the results of neuropsychological examination and Machine Learning algorithms. These findings support the neurobiological validity of neuropsychological examination and the feasibility of a topographical diagnosis in patients with neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Dementia leads to cognitive decline affecting memory, thinking, and behavior. Current pharmaceutical treatments are symptomatic, with limited efficacy and significant drawbacks. Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) is being explored as an adjuvant therapy for dementia because of its potential neuroprotective effects.Areas of Uncertainty:Despite decades of study, EGb761 has not been incorporated into treatment guidelines for these conditions. This review evaluates research futility in EGb761 trials for dementia, analyzing efficacy and methodological challenges to inform future research directions. DATA SOURCES: In this review, we investigate the efficacy and adverse reactions of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) as a treatment for Alzheimer disease or vascular dementia. We searched the randomized controlled trials published between 2006 and 2023 on PubMed and ScienceDirect. RESULTS: The 7 selected studies have shown that the degree of improvement in standard cognitive assessment scores [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), short cognitive performance test (SKT), neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI)] was not significant enough for a substantial proportion of patients. Improvements of the SKT score with at least 3 points in the Alzheimer disease/vascular dementia groups were found only in 2 out of 7 studies, changes of less than 2 points in MMSE score were found in 2 of the studies, while an improvement of at least 4 points in NPI scores was reported in 4 out of 7 studies. We aim to understand why this extract has not reached the level of evidence to be included in guideline recommendation despite extensive research and what have we learned from systematic reviews performed since 2010? Studies included in this review have shown some improvement in outcome scores with EGb761 treatment compared with placebo, but these improvements did not reach the threshold for clinically significant enhancement in MMSE/SKT/NPI scores. Limitations such as small sample sizes, minimal score changes, predominantly placebo comparisons, and short follow-up durations make it challenging to determine the usefulness of EGb761 in dementia treatment. The changes observed and methodological constraints underscore the uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of EGb761. CONCLUSION: The findings do not consistently demonstrate the clinical utility of EGb761, and improved scores on cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments may not necessarily translate into meaningful clinical outcomes for patients with dementia. Starting from the question\u00a0\"What have we learned in the past 18 years?\", the answer would be: not much. Consequently, the question raised is: how long should we go on with the same conclusion, continuing to spend time and financial resources to replicate these results? Research strategies should be refined to optimize decision making and advance evidence-based care for neurocognitive disorders.",

Growing evidence suggests that disrupted neuronal calcium signalling contributes to the pathophysiology of NDs. Additionally, calcium functions as a ubiquitous second messenger involved in diverse cellular processes, from synaptic activity to intercellular communication, making it a potential therapeutic target. Recently, the development of the miniature fluorescence microscope (miniscope) enabled simultaneous recording of the spatiotemporal calcium activity from large neuronal ensembles in unrestrained animals, providing a novel method for studying NDs. In this review, we discuss the abnormalities observed in calcium signalling and its potential as a therapeutic target for NDs.

The inability of mitochondria to transition between their dynamic forms is a critical factor in the development of pathological states. In this paper, we focus on the importance of different types of mitochondrial phenotypes in nervous tissue, discussing how mitochondria in Alzheimer's disease are \"stuck\" in certain patterns and how this pattern maintains itself. Understanding the specific roles and transitions between mitochondrial forms, including tiny, networked, and hyperfused, is crucial in developing new therapies aimed at restoring mitochondrial homeostasis. By targeting these dynamics, we may be able to intervene early in the disease process, offering novel avenues for preventing or treating neurodegeneration.",

Abnormal movements are atypical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. CASE DESCRIPTION: An 87-year-old woman, followed for Alzheimer's disease, experienced abnormal movements. The episodes lasted 30 minutes, were involuntary, uncontrollable, anarchic, predominantly in the upper limbs, and without loss of consciousness or bladder control. An electroencephalogram ruled out atypical epilepsy. Pharmacovigilance investigation ruled out a drug-related cause. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormalities suggestive of Alzheimer's disease, with no other evidence to explain the abnormal movements. Apart from the presence of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid analysis found no abnormality. Dopamine transporter scan rule out an atypical parkinsonian syndrome. Finally, abnormal movements associated with Alzheimer's disease were suspected. Abnormal movements disappeared within 72 hours on low-dose carbamazepine. CONCLUSION: This case is educational both because of the clinical presentation and the management of symptoms. LEARNING POINTS: The number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of major neurocognitive disorders, is expected to reach around 78 million in 2030 and 139 million in 2050.The course of Alzheimer's disease may be punctuated by atypical symptoms, such as abnormal movements.In patients on carbamazepine, we observed a dramatic improvement in abnormal movements associated with Alzheimer's disease.",

Its exact pathology remains uncertain, but multiple treatment hypotheses have emerged. The current treatments, single or combined, alleviate only symptoms and struggle to manage AD due to its multifaceted pathology. The developmental drugs target pivotal disease factors involved in the envisaged hypotheses and include targets such as amyloid aggregation, hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and receptors like cholinergic, adrenergic, etc. Present-day research focuses on multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs), which inhibit multiple factors simultaneously, helping slow the disease's progression. This review attempts to collate the recent information related to proposed hypotheses for AD etiology. It systematically organizes the advances in various therapeutic options for AD, with a particular emphasis on clinical candidates. Also, it is expected to help medicinal chemists design novel AD treatments based on available information, which could be helpful to AD patients.",

The designed hybrid molecules were synthesized via a click chemistry approach and preliminarily screened for cholinesterase and A\u03b21-42 aggregation inhibition. Among them, AS15 emerged as a selective inhibitor of AChE (IC50 = 0.047 \u03bcM) over butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE: IC50 \u2265 10 \u03bcM) with desired A\u03b21-42 aggregation inhibition (72.21% at 50 \u03bcM) properties. In addition, AS15 showed protective effects against DNA damage caused by hydroxyl radicals originating from H2O2. Molecular docking and simulation studies confirmed the favorable interactions of AChE and the A\u03b21-42 monomer desired for their inhibition. AS15 exhibited an LD50 value of 300 mg kg-1 and showed significant improvements in memory and learning behavior in scopolamine-induced cognition impairment mouse-based animal models (Y-maze test and Morris water maze test) for behavioral analysis. Overall outcomes suggest AS15 as a potential preclinical multifunctional candidate for the management of Alzheimer's disease, and it serves as a promising lead for further development of potent and safer multifunctional anti-Alzheimer's agents.",

The evidence showed that the progression of AD was closely related to the apoptosis of nerve cells. This study amis to explore the role and specific mechanism of miR-15a and Bag5 in the apoptosis of nerve cells induced by beta-amyloid protein (A\u03b2) in AD. METHODS: The AD rat model was constructed by injecting A\u03b242 into SD rat brain and the AD cell model was constructed by treating SH-SY5Y cells with A\u03b242. The learning and memory ability of rats was detected by Morris Water Maze. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to detect the pathological changes of brain tissues. Nissl staining was used to detect the changes of cell morphology and number in brain tissues. The upstream miRNA that interacted with Bag5 were screened by bioinformatics analysis. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to detect cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis rate of cells. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA levels of miR-15a and Bag5. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of Bag5, Bax and Caspase-3. MiR-15a knockdown or overexpression vectors or Bag5 knockdown vectors were transfected into AD rat model and AD cell models, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the binding relationship between miR-15a and Bag5. RESULTS: Morris Water Maze, HE staining and Nissl staining showed that the rat model of AD was established successfully, and A\u03b2 could induce neuronal apoptosis and inhibit the expression of miR-15a in AD rats. Compared with normal cells, A\u03b2 treatment significantly increased apoptosis rate and Bag5 expression, and weakened cell proliferation and miR-15a (all P<0.01). Overexpression of miR-15a further enhanced the effect of A\u03b2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis, while knockdown of miR-15a expression had the opposite effect (all P<0.01). Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that there was a negative targeting relationship between miR-15a and Bag5. Compared with Bag5 knockdown alone, the co-transfection of miR-15a inhibitor and si-Bag5 significantly increased the cell proliferation ability and mRNA and protein levels of Bag5, and significantly reduced the cell apoptosis rate and the expression of Bax and Caspase-3, animal studies have also shown consistent results (all P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A\u03b2 can inhibit the expression of miR-15a, thereby inducing the expression of Bag5 and activating the protective mechanism of Bag5 against A\u03b2 induced apoptosis.",

The goal was to assess the scale's psychometric properties, ensuring it accurately measures caregivers' knowledge of dementia-related behavioral and psychological symptoms in a Turkish context. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the data were collected from 212 caregivers providing home-based care to dementia patients across Turkey. Participants completed a 12-item Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) knowledge questionnaire along with a sociodemographic form. To examine the factor structure of the scale, both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted. Sample adequacy for EFA was assessed using the Kaiser- Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure and Bartlett's test of sphericity. For CFA, model fit was evaluated using fit indices such as \u03c72/df, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). The internal consistency of the scale was assessed with Cronbach's alpha coefficient. RESULTS: The findings showed that the BPSD-T has strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.85) and a robust factor structure. Factor loadings ranged from 0.396 to 0.744, supporting the construct validity of the scale. Item-total correlations ranged from 0.437 to 0.711, with the item \"BPSD are the major source of caregiving burden\" having the highest correlation (r=0.711). The results indicate that the BPSD-T is a reliable instrument for assessing caregivers' knowledge of behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia. CONCLUSION: The BPSD-T provides an effective means of identifying knowledge gaps among caregivers in Turkey and serves as a valuable tool for developing training programs aimed at improving the management of BPSD. This study contributes to the literature by validating the scale in a non-Western context, suggesting that enhancing caregivers' knowledge of BPSD can have positive impacts on clinical management and patient care. In this regard, the implementation of the BPSD-T may support the more effective management of behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia patients.",

Extensive studies have been carried out to understand the role of fibrillar seeds on the overall kinetics of amyloid aggregation. However, the precise effect of seeds that are structurally or sequentially different from A\u03b2 on the structure of the resulting amyloid aggregates is yet to be fully understood. Herein, nanoscale infrared spectroscopy is used to probe the spectral facets of individual aggregates formed by aggregating A\u03b242 with antiparallel fibrillar seeds of A\u03b2(16-22) and E22Q A\u03b2(1-40) Dutch mutant and it is demonstrated that A\u03b2 can form heterotypic or mixed polymorphs that deviate significantly from its expected parallel cross \u03b2 structure. It is further shown that the formation of heterotypic aggregates is not limited to the coaggregation of A\u03b2 and its isomers, and that the former can form heterotypic fibrils with alpha-synuclein and brain protein lysates. These findings highlight the complexity of A\u03b2 aggregation in AD and underscore the need to explore how A\u03b2 interacts with other brain components, which is crucial for developing better therapeutic strategies for AD.",

RESULTS: CFA yielded 3 factors: dysphoria, apathy, and cognitive concern. All the dysphoria, apathy, and cognitive concern factors showed acceptable unidimensionality with \u03b1=.76, .59, and .54, respectively. The Cognitive Risk Primary Care cohort had significantly higher mean dysphoria, apathy and cognitive concern scales. CONCLUSIONS: This culturally, linguistically, and educationally diverse sample population yielded factors with acceptable reliability and good face validity. This strategy has resulted in a generalizable measurement model to identify people at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. In particular, the apathy scale score can be used to identify older adults at risk for cognitive and functional decline across research and clinical settings.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Comparing the Artificial Intelligence Detection Models to Standard Diagnostic Methods and Alternative Models in Identifying Alzheimer's Disease in At-Risk or Early Symptomatic Individuals: A Scoping Review.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative illnesses place a heavy strain on the world's healthcare systems, particularly among the aging population. With a focus on research from January 2022 to September 2023, this scoping review, which adheres to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-Scr) criteria, examines the changing landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) applications for early AD detection and diagnosis. Forty-four carefully chosen articles were selected from a pool of 2,966 articles for the qualitative synthesis. The research reveals impressive advancements in AI-driven approaches, including neuroimaging, genomics, cognitive tests, and blood-based biomarkers. Notably, AI models focusing on deep learning (DL) algorithms demonstrate outstanding accuracy in early AD identification, often even before the onset of clinical symptoms. Multimodal approaches, which combine information from various sources, including neuroimaging and clinical assessments, provide comprehensive insights into the complex nature of AD. The study also emphasizes the critical role that blood-based and genetic biomarkers play in strengthening AD diagnosis and risk assessment. When combined with clinical or imaging data, genetic variations and polygenic risk scores help to improve prediction models. In a similar vein, blood-based biomarkers provide non-invasive instruments for detecting metabolic changes linked to AD. Cognitive and functional evaluations, which include neuropsychological examinations and assessments of daily living activities, serve as essential benchmarks for monitoring the course of AD and directing treatment interventions. When these evaluations are included in machine learning models, the diagnosis accuracy is improved, and treatment monitoring is made more accessible. In addition, including methods that support model interpretability and explainability helps in the thorough understanding and valuable implementation of AI-driven insights in clinical contexts. This review further identifies several gaps in the research landscape, including the need for diverse, high-quality datasets to address data heterogeneity and improve model generalizability. Practical implementation challenges, such as integrating AI systems into clinical workflows and clinician adoption, are highlighted as critical barriers to real-world application. Moreover, ethical considerations, particularly surrounding data privacy and informed consent, must be prioritized as AI adoption in healthcare accelerates. Performance metrics (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC)) for AI-based approaches are discussed, with a need for clearer reporting and comparative analyses. Addressing these limitations, alongside methodological clarity and critical evaluation of biases, would strengthen the credibility of AI applications in AD detection. By expanding its scope, this study highlights areas for improvement and future opportunities in early detection, aiming to bridge the gap between innovative AI technologies and practical clinical utility.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Alzheimer's disease recognition based on waveform and spectral speech signal processing.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with an irreversible progression. Currently, it is diagnosed using invasive and costly methods, such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological assessments. Recent studies indicate that certain changes in language ability can predict early cognitive decline, highlighting the potential of speech analysis in AD recognition. Based on this premise, this study proposes an AD recognition multi-channel network framework, which is referred to as the ADNet. It integrates both time-domain and frequency-domain features of speech signals, using waveform images and log-Mel spectrograms derived from raw speech as data sources. The framework employs inverted residual blocks to enhance the learning of low-level time-domain features and uses gated multi-information units to effectively combine local and global frequency-domain features. The study tests it on a dataset from the Shanghai cognitive screening (SCS) digital neuropsychological assessment. The results show that the method we proposed outperforms existing speech-based methods, achieving an accuracy of 88.57%, a precision of 88.67%, and a recall of 88.64%. This study demonstrates that the proposed framework can effectively distinguish between the AD and normal controls, and it may be useful for developing early recognition tools for AD.",

METHODS: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage measured by national Area Deprivation Index (ADI) rank with measures of cardiometabolic health and cognition among Wake Forest (WF) Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) participants, with and without MCI. RESULTS: ADI was positively associated with blood pressure and cardiometabolic index (CMI), and negatively associated with global and Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC5) scores, in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. ADI was only positively associated with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in MCI. DISCUSSION: Neighborhood disadvantage is associated more strongly with measures of cardiometabolic health and cognition among CU individuals rather than MCI. These findings demonstrate a need for structural solutions to address social determinants of health in an attempt to reduce cardiometabolic and cognitive risks.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba leaf extract EGb 761\u00ae has shown clinical efficacy in patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. However, the pharmacological action of EGb 761\u00ae in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear and molecular mechanisms targeted in the brain are not completely understood. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate 1) the potential sex-dependent effects of oral administration of EGb 761\u00ae in 5xFAD mice, an AD mouse model, and 2) the underlying microglial subtype responsible for the observed anti-inflammatory effects in the brain. METHODS: Eight-week old 5xFAD and wild type mice received EGb 761\u00ae-supplemented diet or control diet for eight weeks. The study investigated changes in cognitive function as well as amyloid plaque load, expression of AD-related genes, and anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, we used organotypic brain slices for confirmation and assessment of concentration-dependency of the observed EGb 761\u00ae effects and performed single cell RNA sequencing on the prefrontal cortex of male mice with focus on microglia. RESULTS: We demonstrate that EGb 761\u00ae treatment improves cognitive function in 5xFAD mice in several behavioral tests. Analysis of the brain tissue from these animals indicated a reduction in amyloid plaque load in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This brain area was further investigated to assess the molecular changes that occurred following EGb 761\u00ae intake. Alterations in the expression of genes related to AD were highly sex-specific with effects on the cholinergic system, the \u03b3-secretase complex, and neuroinflammation. Anti-inflammatory effects of EGb 761\u00ae with a particularly pronounced reduction of the TNF\u03b1-response could be shown for the PFC but also peripherally in the serum of 5xFAD mice of both sexes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that EGb761\u00ae mainly affected disease-associated microglia stage 2 (DAM2), which are thought to have a detrimental role in AD. CONCLUSIONS: EGb 761\u00ae shows efficacy in the treatment of cognitive deficits in the 5xFAD mouse model via multimodal activity, including sex-specific and sex-unrelated mechanisms including the normalization of neuroinflammatory parameters.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative Tauopathies are a part of several neurological disorders and aging-related diseases including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism, and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. The major hallmarks present in these conditions include Tau pathology (composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau tangles) and synaptic loss. in vivo studies linking Tau pathology and mitochondrial alterations at the synapse, an avenue that could lead to synaptic loss, remain predominantly scarce. For this reason, using 3-month-old wild-type and human mutant Tau P301S transgenic mice, we investigated the association of Tau with mitochondria, synaptosome bioenergetics, and characterized excitatory synaptic loss across hippocampal regions (Dentate Gyrus, perisomatic CA3, and perisomatic CA1) and in the parietal cortex. We found a significant loss of excitatory synapses in the parietal cortex and hippocampal Dentate Gyrus (DG) of Tau P301S mice. Furthermore, we found that Tau (total and disease-relevant phosphorylated Tau) associates with both the non-synaptic and synaptic mitochondria of Tau P301S mice and this coincided with synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction. The findings presented here suggest that Tau associates with mitochondria at the synapse, leading to synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction, and likely contributing to synaptic loss.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurological disorder. Based on clinical characteristics, it can be categorized into normal cognition (NC), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia (AD). Once the condition begins to progress, the process is usually irreversible. Therefore, early identification and intervention are crucial for patients. This study aims to explore the sensitivity of fNIRS in distinguishing between SCD and MCI. METHODS: An in-depth analysis of the Functional Connectivity (FC) and oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) characteristics during resting state and different memory cognitive tasks is conducted on two patient groups to search for potential biomarkers. The 33 participants were divided into two groups: SCD and MCI. RESULTS: Functional connectivity strength during the resting state and hemodynamic changes during the execution of Verbal Fluency Tasks (VFT) and MemTrax tasks were measured using fNIRS. The results showed that compared to individuals with MCI, patients with SCD exhibited higher average FC levels between different channels in the frontal lobe during resting state, with two channels' FC demonstrating significant ability to distinguish between SCD and MCI. During the VFT task, the overall average HbO concentration in the frontal lobe of SCD patients was higher than that of MCI patients from 5 experimental paradigm. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that the accuracy of the above features in distinguishing SCD from MCI was 78.8%, 72.7%, 75.8%, and 66.7%, respectively. DISCUSSION: fNIRS could potentially serve as a non-invasive biomarker for the early detection of dementia.",

To our knowledge, this is the first known case of LGS along with Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) bacteremia in a neurodegenerative disease patient. The patient was an 81-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's disease, cerebral infarction, and diverticulitis in a psychiatric hospital, fed via a nasogastric tube. During hospitalization, he developed a 37.4\u2103 temperature and disturbance of consciousness evaluated as 3 points on the Glasgow Coma Scale. A follow-up blood examination revealed a white blood cell count of 29,000/\u00b5L and a C-reactive protein value of 11.2 mg/dL. Computed tomography revealed an increased concentration of peripheral adipose tissue from the sigmoid colon to the rectum and significant quantities of stool in the rectum. Treatment was initiated with doripenem (DRPM) for sepsis of unknown focus. C. perfringens was subsequently identified in both two blood culture tests. He improved with decreased inflammatory response; DRPM was terminated after 14 days. He remains free of recurrence. We speculate that the LGS in this case may have developed from dopaminergic neuronal decrease and impaired amino acid metabolism caused by chronic hypo-inflammation due to neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer's disease).

        "ArticleTitle": "Mitochondrial protective potential of fucoxanthin in brain disorders.",
        "AbstractText": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common feature of brain disorders. Mitochondria play a central role in oxidative phosphorylation; thus changes in energy metabolism in the brain have been reported in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. In addition, mitochondria regulate cellular responses associated with neuronal damage such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), and apoptosis. Therefore, interventions that aim to protect mitochondria may be effective against brain disorders. Fucoxanthin is a marine carotenoid that has recently gained recognition for its neuroprotective properties. However, the cellular mechanisms of fucoxanthin in brain disorders, particularly its role in mitochondrial function, have not been thoroughly discussed. This review summarises the current literature on the effects of fucoxanthin on oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis using in vitro and in vivo models of brain disorders. We further present the potential mechanisms by which fucoxanthin protects mitochondria, with the objective of developing dietary interventions for a spectrum of brain disorders. Although the studies reviewed are predominantly preclinical studies, they provide important insights into understanding the cellular and molecular functions of fucoxanthin in the brain. Future studies investigating the mechanisms of action and the molecular targets of fucoxanthin are warranted to develop translational approaches to brain disorders.",

We introduce \"genome-wide association neural networks (GWANN)\" a novel approach that uses neural networks (NNs) to perform a gene-level association study with family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In UK Biobank, we defined cases (n\u2009=\u200942\u00a0110) as those with AD or family history of AD and sampled an equal number of controls. The data was split into an 80:20 ratio of training and testing samples, and GWANN was trained on the former followed by identifying associated genes using its performance on the latter. Our method identified 18 genes to be associated with family history of AD. APOE, BIN1, SORL1, ADAM10, APH1B, and SPI1 have been identified by previous AD GWAS. Among the 12 new genes, PCDH9, NRG3, ROR1, LINGO2, SMYD3, and LRRC7 have been associated with neurofibrillary tangles or phosphorylated tau in previous studies. Furthermore, there is evidence for differential transcriptomic or proteomic expression between AD and healthy brains for 10 of the 12 new genes. A series of post hoc analyses resulted in a significantly enriched protein-protein interaction network (P-value\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910-16), and enrichment of relevant disease and biological pathways such as focal adhesion (P-value\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4), extracellular matrix organization (P-value\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4), Hippo signaling (P-value\u2009=\u20097\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4), Alzheimer's disease (P-value\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4), and impaired cognition (P-value\u2009=\u20094\u2009\u00d7\u200910-3).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the temporal trends in mental health-related terminology in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials as a proxy measure of research interest. Additionally, it sought to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frequency of these terms through pre-pandemic and post-pandemic trend assessment. METHODS: In this retrospective descriptive analysis, we included 2243 trials with a start date between 1988 and 2022 by searching for the keyword \"Alzheimer Disease\" in the U.S. National Library of Medicine ClinicaTrials.gov database. A Python program was created to extract and count the frequency of four mental health terms (loneliness, depression, anxiety, and distress) by year and trial status (e.g., completed, active, recruiting). Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the yearly patterns in the appearance of the four mental health terms. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify trial characteristics associated with each mental health term. RESULTS: Our results depicted a statistically significant increasing trend in three (i.e., loneliness, anxiety, distress) of the four mental health conditions by year. A comparison between pre-pandemic and post-pandemic trials showed an increase in the mention of the same three words over time. INTERPRETATION: These results may suggest a growing awareness of mental health conditions and a greater interest in considering these conditions in Alzheimer's disease trials, particularly after the onset of COVID-19. Future researchers should conduct more in-depth analyses to examine how mental health variables are operationalized in these trials, with consideration for their subsequent success.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: To summarize the delirium treatment trial literature, identify the unique challenges in delirium treatment trials, and formulate recommendations to address each in older adults. DESIGN: A 39-member interprofessional and international expert working group of clinicians (physicians, nurses, and pharmacists) and nonclinicians (biostatisticians, epidemiologists, and trial methodologists) was convened. Four expert panels were assembled to explore key subtopics (pharmacological/nonpharmacologic treatment, methodological challenges, and novel research designs). METHODS: To provide background and context, a review of delirium treatment randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2003 and 2023 was conducted and evidence gaps were identified. The four panels addressed the identified subtopics. For each subtopic, research challenges were identified and recommendations to address each were proposed through virtual discussion before a live, full-day, and in-person conference. General agreement was reached for each proposed recommendation across the entire working group via moderated conference discussion. Recommendations were synthesized across panels and iteratively discussed through rounds of virtual meetings and draft reviews. RESULTS: We identified key evidence gaps through a systematic literature review, yielding 43 RCTs of delirium treatments. From this review, eight unique challenges for delirium treatment trials were identified, and recommendations to address each were made based on panel input. The recommendations start with design of interventions that consider the multifactorial nature of delirium, include both pharmacological and nonpharmacologic approaches, and target pathophysiologic pathways where possible. Selecting appropriate at-risk patients with moderate vulnerability to delirium may maximize effectiveness. Targeting patients with at least moderate delirium severity and duration will include those most likely to experience adverse outcomes. Delirium severity should be the primary outcome of choice; measurement of short- and long-term clinical outcomes will maximize clinical relevance. Finally, plans for handling informative censoring and missing data are key. CONCLUSIONS: By addressing key delirium treatment challenges and research gaps, our recommendations may serve as a roadmap for advancing delirium treatment research in older adults.",

Thus, diverse ML models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and Rough Sets, were trained and evaluated. Models used volumes, Euclidean, and Cosine distances of subcortical brain structures relative to the thalamus to differentiate among control (HC), prodromal (PR), and PD groups. Based on three separate experiments, the Logistic Regression approach was optimal, providing low feature complexity and strong predictive performance (accuracy: 85%, precision: 88%, recall: 85%) in PD-stage recognition.

This evaluation examines total duration, subtask duration, and other quantitative measures across two trials. We show that the diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing PD from controls decreases by a mean of 1.8% between the first and the second trial, suggesting that task repetition may not be necessary for accurate diagnosis. Although the total duration remains relatively consistent between trials (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.62 to 0.95), greater variability is seen in subtask duration and sensor-derived measures, reflected in machine learning performance and statistical differences. Our findings also show that this variability differs not only between controls and PD participants but also among groups with varying levels of PD severity, indicating the need to consider population characteristics. Relying solely on total task duration and conventional statistical metrics to gauge the reliability of mobility tasks may fail to reveal nuanced variations in movement.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Amyloid peptides, whose accumulation in the brain as senile plaques is associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease, are also found in cerebral vessels and in circulation. In the bloodstream, amyloid peptides promote platelet adhesion, activation, oxidative stress, and thrombosis, contributing to the cardiovascular complications observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. Natural compounds, such as curcumin, are known to modulate platelet activation induced by the hemostatic stimuli thrombin and convulxin. In this study, we investigated the ability of curcumin to modulate platelet activation triggered by amyloid peptides, and we compared its effects with those displayed on platelet activation induced by physiological agonists. METHODS: Commercial ultrapure curcumin was used, and platelet aggregation, granule secretion, phosphorylation of selected signaling proteins, and reactive oxygen species production were analyzed on isolated human platelets. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that curcumin effectively suppressed platelet aggregation induced by fibrillar amyloid peptides. This effect was associated with the reduction in intracellular signaling pathways involving PKC, PI3K, and MAPK. By contrast, platelet aggregation and activation induced by thrombin and convulxin were only partially reduced by preincubation with curcumin. Moreover, curcumin completely suppressed granule secretion only when platelets were stimulated with hemostatic agonists, but it had no effects upon stimulation with amyloid peptides. Additionally, curcumin reduced the production of reactive oxygen species induced by amyloid peptides with a stronger efficiency compared to platelets stimulated with thrombin. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that curcumin displays selective and potent inhibitory activity on platelet responses to pathological stimuli, such as fibrillar amyloid peptides.",

AD is characterized by pathological features such as \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaque accumulation, tau neurofibrillary tangles formation, oxidative stress, an impaired cholinergic system, and neuroinflammation. Many therapeutic drugs have been developed to slow the progression of AD by targeting these pathological mechanisms. However, synthetic drugs, such as donepezil and memantine, can often lead to side effects. In this context, seaweeds have been drawing attention as a nutrient source and a potential source of health-improving metabolites. Studies have shown that extracts from brown macroalgae can potentially reduce the inflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine expression. Furthermore, their bioactive compounds exhibit antioxidant properties vital in combating oxidative stress. Antioxidants, mainly carotenoids and phenolic compounds, have been linked to improved cognitive function and a reduced risk of neurodegenerative disorders by protecting neuronal cells through their ability to scavenge free radicals. In addition, omega-3 fatty acids found in certain macroalgae have the potential to support brain health and cognitive function, further enhancing their neuroprotective effects. In conclusion, this review has comprehensively evaluated the research conducted on brown macroalgae in the last five years, covering their potential bioactive compounds, methods of obtaining these compounds, and their neuroprotective properties against AD. The limited number of clinical studies in the literature highlights the need for further research. This narrative review provides a basic framework for new approaches to neuroprotective strategies, such as those associated with brown macroalgae natural resources. Furthermore, they may play an increasingly important role in developing functional foods and nutraceuticals that can support human health in preventing and managing neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Mechanisms and Potential Benefits of Neuroprotective Agents in Neurological Health.",
        "AbstractText": "The brain contains many interconnected and complex cellular and molecular mechanisms. Injury to the brain causes permanent dysfunctions in these mechanisms. So, it continues to be an area where surgical intervention cannot be performed except for the removal of tumors and the repair of some aneurysms. Some agents that can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach neurons show neuroprotective effects in the brain due to their anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In particular, some agents act by reducing or modulating the accumulation of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease) caused by protein accumulation. Substrate accumulation causes increased oxidative stress and stimulates the brain's immune cells, microglia, and astrocytes, to secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Long-term or chronic neuroinflammatory response triggers apoptosis. Brain damage is observed with neuronal apoptosis and brain functions are impaired. This situation negatively affects processes such as motor movements, memory, perception, and learning. Neuroprotective agents prevent apoptosis by modulating molecules that play a role in apoptosis. In addition, they can improve impaired brain functions by supporting neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Due to the important roles that these agents play in central nervous system damage or neurodegenerative diseases, it is important to elucidate many mechanisms. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms of flavonoids, which constitute a large part of the agents with neuroprotective effects, as well as vitamins, neurotransmitters, hormones, amino acids, and their derivatives. It is thought that understanding these mechanisms will enable the development of new therapeutic agents and different treatment strategies.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Associations of Coffee and Tea Consumption on Neural Network Connectivity: Unveiling the Role of Genetic Factors in Alzheimer's Disease Risk.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Coffee and tea are widely consumed beverages, but their long-term effects on cognitive function and aging remain largely unexplored. Lifestyle interventions, particularly dietary habits, offer promising strategies for enhancing cognitive performance and preventing cognitive decline. METHODS: This study utilized data from the UK Biobank cohort (n = 12,025) to examine the associations between filtered coffee, green tea, and standard tea consumption and neural network functional connectivity across seven resting-state networks. We focused on networks spanning prefrontal and occipital areas that are linked to complex cognitive and behavioral functions. Linear mixed models were used to assess the main effects of coffee and tea consumption, as well as their interactions with Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic risk-the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: Higher filtered coffee consumption was associated with increased functional connectivity in several networks, including Motor Execution, Sensorimotor, Fronto-Cingular, and a Prefrontal + 'What' Pathway Network. Similarly, greater green tea intake was associated with enhanced connectivity in the Extrastriate Visual and Primary Visual Networks. In contrast, higher standard tea consumption was linked to reduced connectivity in networks such as Memory Consolidation, Motor Execution, Fronto-Cingular, and the \"What\" Pathway + Prefrontal Network. The APOE4 genotype and family history of AD influenced the relationship between coffee intake and connectivity in the Memory Consolidation Network. Additionally, the APOE4 genotype modified the association between standard tea consumption and connectivity in the Sensorimotor Network. CONCLUSIONS: The distinct patterns of association between coffee, green tea, and standard tea consumption and resting-state brain activity may provide insights into AD-related brain changes. The APOE4 genotype, in particular, appears to play a significant role in modulating these relationships. These findings enhance our knowledge of how commonly consumed beverages may influence cognitive function and potentially AD risk among older adults.",

        "AbstractText": "Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a chronic, multifactorial, and progressive neurodegenerative disease that associates with aging and is highly prevalent in our older population (\u226565 years of age). This hypothesis generating this narrative review will examine the important role for the use of sodium thiosulfate (STS) as a possible multi-targeting treatment option for LOAD. Sulfur is widely available in our environment and is responsible for forming organosulfur compounds that are known to be associated with a wide range of biological activities in the brain. STS is known to have (i) antioxidant and (ii) anti-inflammatory properties; (iii) chelation properties for calcium and the pro-oxidative cation metals such as iron and copper; (iv) donor properties for hydrogen sulfide production; (v) possible restorative properties for brain endothelial-cell-derived bioavailable nitric oxide. Thus, it becomes apparent that STS has the potential for neuroprotection and neuromodulation and may allow for an attenuation of the progressive nature of neurodegeneration and impaired cognition in LOAD. STS has been successfully used to prevent cisplatin oxidative-stress-induced ototoxicity in the treatment of head and neck and solid cancers, cyanide and arsenic poisoning, and fungal skin diseases. Most recently, intravenous STS has become part of the treatment plan for calciphylaxis globally due to vascular calcification and ischemia-induced skin necrosis and ulceration. Side effects have been minimal with reports of metabolic acidosis and increased anion gap; as with any drug treatment, there is also the possibility of allergic reactions, possible long-term osteoporosis from animal studies to date, and minor side-effects of nausea, headache, and rhinorrhea if infused too rapidly. While STS poorly penetrates the intact blood-brain barrier(s) (BBBs), it could readily penetrate BBBs that are dysfunctional and disrupted to deliver its neuroprotective and neuromodulating effects in addition to its ability to penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier of the choroid plexus. Novel strategies such as the future use of nano-technology may be helpful in allowing an increased entry of STS into the brain.",

        "AbstractText": "Herbal medicine, particularly in developing regions, remains highly popular due to its cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and minimal risk of adverse effects. Curcuma longa L., commonly known as turmeric, exemplifies such herbal remedies with its extensive history of culinary and medicinal applications across Asia for thousands of years. Traditionally utilized as a dye, flavoring, and in cultural rituals, turmeric has also been employed to treat a spectrum of medical conditions, including inflammatory, bacterial, and fungal infections, jaundice, tumors, and ulcers. Building on this longstanding use, contemporary biochemical and clinical research has identified curcumin-the primary active compound in turmeric-as possessing significant therapeutic potential. This review hypothesizes that curcumin's antioxidant properties are pivotal in preventing and treating chronic inflammatory diseases, which are often precursors to more severe conditions, such as cancer, and neurological disorders, like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, while curcumin demonstrates a favorable safety profile, its anticoagulant effects warrant cautious application. This article synthesizes recent studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin's actions and evaluates its therapeutic efficacy in various human illnesses, including cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, peptic ulcers, COVID-19, psoriasis, vitiligo, and depression. By integrating diverse research findings, this review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on curcumin's role in modern medicine and its potential as a multifaceted therapeutic agent.",

        "AbstractText": "The hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the buildup of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), which is produced when the amyloid precursor protein (APP) misfolds and deposits as neurotoxic plaques in the brain. A functional iron responsive element (IRE) RNA stem loop is encoded by the APP 5'-UTR and may be a target for regulating the production of Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein. Since modifying A\u03b2 protein expression can give anti-amyloid efficacy and protective brain iron balance, targeted regulation of amyloid protein synthesis through modulation of 5'-UTR sequence function is a novel method for the prospective therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Numerous mRNA interference strategies target the 2D RNA structure, even though messenger RNAs like tRNAs and rRNAs can fold into complex, three-dimensional structures, adding even another level of complexity. The IRE family is among the few known 3D mRNA regulatory elements. This review seeks to describe the structural and functional aspects of IREs in transcripts, including that of the amyloid precursor protein, that are relevant to neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. The mRNAs encoding the proteins involved in iron metabolism are controlled by this family of similar base sequences. Like ferritin IRE RNA in their 5'-UTR, iron controls the production of APP in their 5'-UTR. Iron misregulation by iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) can also be investigated and contrasted using measurements of the expression levels of tau production, A\u03b2, and APP. The development of AD is aided by iron binding to A\u03b2, which promotes A\u03b2 aggregation. The development of small chemical therapeutics to control IRE-modulated expression of APP is increasingly thought to target messenger RNAs. Thus, IRE-modulated APP expression in AD has important therapeutic implications by targeting mRNA structures.",

Initially, the clinical adoption of FBB PET faced significant barriers, including reimbursement challenges and uncertainties regarding its integration into diagnostic clinical practice. This review examines the progress made in overcoming these obstacles and describes the concurrent evolution of the diagnostic landscape. Advances in quantification methods have further strengthened the traditional visual assessment approach. Over the past decade, compelling evidence has emerged, demonstrating that amyloid PET has a strong impact on AD diagnosis, management, and outcomes across diverse clinical scenarios, even in the absence of amyloid-targeted therapies. Amyloid PET imaging has become essential in clinical trials and the application of new AD therapeutics, particularly for confirming eligibility criteria (i.e., the presence of amyloid plaques) and monitoring biological responses to amyloid-lowering therapies. Since its approval, FBB PET has transitioned from a purely diagnostic tool aimed primarily at excluding amyloid pathology to a critical component in AD drug development, and today, it is essential in the diagnostic workup and therapy management of approved AD treatments.",

        "AbstractText": "Background/Objectives: Tacrine is a centrally active non-competitive reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It also exerts antagonising activity against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Tacrine was approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in 1993, but was withdrawn from clinical use in 2013 because of its hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal side effects. Nevertheless, tacrine is currently facing a renewed wave of interest primarily due to several new tacrine-incorporated hybrids and derivates. There were two specific aims for this study: firstly, to explain the mechanisms of the adverse action of tacrine, as a distinctive example of a highly effective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; and secondly to check whether luminal impedance planimetry is feasible for preclinical testing of possible side effects of compounds potentially toxic to the gastrointestinal tract. Methods: Six experimental pigs were used as the animal model in this study. Five major parameters were evaluated: luminal pressure (mmHg), estimated diameter (mm), cross-sectional area (mm2), distensibility (mm2/mmHg), and zone compliance (mm3/mmHg). All measurements were performed before and 360 min after intragastric administration of 200 mg tacrine (at the porcine tacrine Tmax). Results: This study consistently demonstrated an increase in luminal pressure (a directly measured indicator) for the particular balloon filling volumes used, and inversely a reciprocal decrease in the other parameters after tacrine administration. Conclusions: Endoscopic luminal impedance planimetry is a feasible method to evaluate functional response of the lower oesophageal sphincter to tacrine in experimental pigs. Tacrine did not compromise the function of the lower oesophageal sphincter either toward oesophageal spasms or, in contrast, decreased competence of the lower oesophageal sphincter.",

Furthermore, effective curative treatments are very limited. Epidemiologic studies provide convincing evidence for a significant association between type 2 diabetes and AD. Here, we showed energy metabolism using glucose, lactate, ketone bodies, and lipids as energy substrates in a normal brain, and changes in such energy metabolism due to type 2 diabetes. We also showed the influences of such altered energy metabolism due to type 2 diabetes on the pathology of AD.

        "AbstractText": "Aging and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) are the two most significant risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Compared to APOE3, APOE4 disrupts cholesterol homeostasis, increases cholesteryl esters (CEs), and exacerbates neuroinflammation in brain cells, including microglia. Targeting CEs and neuroinflammation could be a novel strategy to ameliorate APOE4-dependent phenotypes. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a key macromolecule in inflammation, and its regulation is associated with the cholesterol content of lipid rafts in cell membranes. We previously demonstrated that in normal microglia expressing APOE3, inhibiting the cholesterol storage enzyme acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1/SOAT1) reduces CEs, dampened neuroinflammation via modulating the fate of TLR4. We also showed that treating myelin debris-loaded normal microglia with ACAT inhibitor F12511 reduced cellular CEs and activated ABC transporter 1 (ABCA1) for cholesterol efflux. This study found that treating primary microglia expressing APOE4 with F12511 also reduces CEs, activates ABCA1, and dampens LPS-dependent NF\u03baB activation. In vivo, two-week injections of nanoparticle F12511, which consists of DSPE-PEG2000, phosphatidylcholine, and F12511, to aged female APOE4 mice reduced TLR4 protein content and decreased proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2 in mice brains.

Among the several factors that may concur to AD development, elevated cholesterol levels and brain cholesterol dyshomeostasis have been recognized to play a relevant role. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a protein primarily known to regulate plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) rich in cholesterol and to be one of the main causes of familial hypercholesterolemia. In addition to that, PCSK9 is also recognized to carry out diverse important activities in the brain, including control of neuronal differentiation, apoptosis, and, importantly, LDL receptors functionality. Moreover, PCSK9 appeared to be directly involved in some of the principal processes responsible for AD development, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and A\u03b2 deposition. On these bases, PCSK9 management might represent a promising approach for AD treatment. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the role of PCSK9, whether or not cholesterol-related, in AD pathogenesis and to give an updated overview of the most innovative therapeutic strategies developed so far to counteract the pleiotropic activities of both humoral and brain PCSK9, focusing in particular on their potentiality for AD management.",

        "AbstractText": "Choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT) is the key cholinergic enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of acetylcholine (ACh), a crucial signaling molecule with both canonical neurotransmitter function and auto- and paracrine signaling activity in non-neuronal cells, such as lymphocytes and astroglia. Cholinergic dysfunction is linked to both neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated a serendipitous observation, namely that the catalytic rate of human recombinant ChAT (rhChAT) protein greatly differed in buffered solution in the presence and absence of Triton X-100 (TX100). At a single concentration of 0.05% (v/v), TX100 boosted the specific activity of rhChAT by 4-fold. Dose-response analysis within a TX100 concentration range of 0.8% to 0.008% (accounting for 13.7 mM to 0.013 mM) resulted in an S-shaped response curve, indicative of an over 10-fold boost in the catalytic rate of rhChAT. This dramatic boost was unlikely due to a mere structural stabilization since it remained even after the addition of 1.0 mg/mL gelatin to the ChAT solution as a protein stabilizer. Furthermore, we found that the catalytic function of the ACh-degrading enzyme, AChE, was unaffected by TX100, underscoring the specificity of the effect for ChAT. Examination of the dose-response curve in relation to the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of TX100 revealed that a boost in ChAT activity occurred when the TX100 concentration passed its CMC, indicating that formation of micelle-ChAT complexes was crucial. We challenged this hypothesis by repeating the experiment on Tween 20 (TW20), another non-ionic surfactant with ~3-fold lower CMC compared to TX100 (0.06 vs. 0.2 mM). The analysis confirmed that micelle formation is crucial for ultra-boosting the activity of ChAT. In silico molecular dynamic simulation supported the notion of ChAT-micelle complex formation. We hypothesize that TX100 or TW20 micelles, by mimicking cell-membrane microenvironments, facilitate ChAT in accessing its full catalytic potential by fine-tuning its structural stabilization and/or enhancing its substrate accessibility. These insights are expected to facilitate research toward the development of new cholinergic-enhancing therapeutics through the formulation of micelle-embedded ChAT nanoparticles.",

This review explores its potential across various pathophysiological processes that are often considered independent. Elevated in healthy states but reduced in diseases, irisin improves muscle-adipose communication, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic balance by enhancing mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress. It promotes osteogenesis and mitigates bone loss in osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Irisin exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling and countering insulin resistance. In the brain, it reduces amyloid-\u03b2 toxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress, enhancing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, which improves cognition and synaptic health in AD models. It also regulates dopamine pathways, potentially alleviating neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and apathy. By linking physical activity to systemic health, irisin emphasizes its role in the muscle-bone-brain axis.

Second, the primary enzyme that directs their aggregation is transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), a brain-localized enzyme involved in neurodegeneration. Third, TGM2 binds to calmodulin, a regulatory event that can increase the activity of this enzyme threefold. Fourth, the most common mixed pathology toxic biomarkers (A\u03b2, pTau, \u03b1Syn, nHtt) also bind calmodulin, which can affect their ability to aggregate. This review examines the potential therapeutic routes opened up by this knowledge. The end goal reveals multiple opportunities that are immediately available for universal therapeutic treatment of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases facing humankind.",

        "AbstractText": "This review aims to address the significant challenges of treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, strokes, spinal cord injuries, and brain tumors. These disorders are difficult to manage due to the complexity of disease mechanisms and the protective blood-brain barrier (BBB), which restricts drug delivery. Recent advancements in nanoparticle (NP) technologies offer promising solutions, with potential applications in drug delivery, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. By examining current research, we explore how NPs can cross the BBB, deliver medications directly to targeted CNS regions, and enhance both diagnostics and treatment. Key NP strategies, such as passive targeting, receptor-mediated transport, and stimuli-responsive systems, demonstrate encouraging results. Studies show that NPs may improve drug delivery, minimize side effects, and increase therapeutic effectiveness in models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and glioblastoma. NP technologies thus represent a promising approach for CNS disorder management, combining drug delivery and diagnostic capabilities to enable more precise and effective treatments that could significantly benefit patient outcomes.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Anthranilic Acid-G-Protein Coupled Receptor109A-Cytosolic Phospholipase A2-Myelin-Cognition Cascade: A New Target for the Treatment/Prevention of Cognitive Impairment in Schizophrenia, Dementia, and Aging.",
        "AbstractText": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of neurodevelopmental (schizophrenia) and aging-associated (mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia) neurodegenerative diseases. Limited efficacy of current pharmacological treatments warrants further search for new targets for nootropic interventions. The breakdown of myelin, a phospholipids axonal sheath that protects the conduction of nerve impulse between neurons, was proposed as a neuropathological abnormality that precedes and promotes the deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 in neuritic plaques. The present review of the recent literature and our own pre- and clinical data suggest (for the first time) that the anthranilic acid (AA)-induced activation of microglial-expressed G-protein coupled receptor (GPR109A) inhibits cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), an enzyme that triggers the degradation of myelin and consequently attenuates cognitive impairment. The present review suggests that the up-regulation of AA formation is a sex-specific compensatory (adaptive) reaction aimed to prevent/treat cognitive impairment. The AA-GPR109A-cPLA2-myelin-cognition cascade suggests new nootropic interventions, e.g., the administration of pegylated kynureninase, an enzyme that catalyzes AA formation from Kynurenine (Kyn), a tryptophane catabolite; pegylated interferon-alpha; central and peripheral Kyn aminotransferase inhibitors that increase availability of Kyn as a substrate for AA formation; and vagus nerve stimulation. The cascade predicts nootropic activity of exogenous GPR109A agonists that were designed and underwent clinical trials (unsuccessful) as anti-dyslipidemia agents. The proposed cascade might contribute to the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Data on AA in neurodegenerative disorders are scarce, and the proposed cascade needs further exploration in pre- and clinical studies.",

        "AbstractText": "Background and Objectives: Alzheimer's dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects memory abilities due to genetic and environmental factors. A well-known gene that influences the risk of Alzheimer's disease is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. The APOE gene is involved in the production of a protein that helps transport cholesterol and other types of fat in the bloodstream. Problems in this process are thought to contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease. APOE comes in several forms, which are called alleles (\u03b52, \u03b53, \u03b54). Materials and Methods: Therefore, our study aims to identify those subjects with a higher genetic risk through the polymorphism of the APOE gene, using a population screening in patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD in a region of Spain, Castilla y Le\u00f3n, as potential biomarkers and to identify individuals at increased genetic risk by polymorphism of the APOE gene. An observational case-control study was conducted in Castilla y Le\u00f3n (Spain). Saliva samples were collected and the ApoE gene was analyzed by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis, respecting ethical criteria. Results: In the Alzheimer's population in Castilla y Le\u00f3n, a high prevalence of ApoE3 (74%) was found, followed by ApoE4 (22%); in addition, a higher presence of the \u03b54 allele was found in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) group than in the control group. It was also observed that the \u03b52/\u03b52 genotype was not found in any individual with AD but was found in healthy subjects and that the opposite was observed for the \u03b54/\u03b54 genotype. The odds ratio (OR) indicated a risk four times greater of having AD if having the \u03b54 allele. Conclusions: The demonstrated relation between the different isoforms and the likelihood of developing AD has led to its consideration as a biomarker and a potential pre-symptomatic therapy. The molecular mechanisms that confer a disruptive and protective role to ApoE4 and ApoE2, respectively, are still being studied.",

The variability in clinical trial outcomes for treating Alzheimer's disease with memantine is not yet fully understood. We conducted a randomized in silico study comparing virtual DBS therapies with treatment involving an NMDA antagonist combined with DBS in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Neural network models representing Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were randomly assigned to four groups: AD, memantine treatment, DBS, and DBS and memantine. Out of 100 unique neural networks created to model moderate and severe AD with varying hippocampal synaptic loss, 20 were randomly selected to represent AD patients. Virtual treatments-memantine, DBS, and DBS and memantine-were applied, resulting in a total of 80 simulations. Results: The normalized mean number of spikes in the CA1 region among the virtual AD hippocampi treated with memantine, DBS therapy, and DBS and memantine differed significantly (p < 0.0001). The normalized mean number of spikes in the virtual AD hippocampi was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.29-0.36) and was significantly lower compared to the number of spikes in the virtual AD hippocampi treated with memantine, which was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.48-0.59) (p = 0.0162), and in the DBS and memantine group, which was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.57-0.78) (p = 0.0001).

        "AbstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-leading cause of death among neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting around 2% of the population. It is expected that the incidence of PD will exceed 12 million by 2040. Meanwhile, there is a recognized difference in the phenotypical expression of the disease and response to treatment between men and women. Men have twice the incidence of PD compared to women, who have a late onset and worse prognosis that is usually associated with menopause. In addition, the incidence of PD in women is associated with the cumulative estrogen levels in their bodies. These differences are suggested to be due to the protective effect of estrogen on the brain, which cannot be given in clinical practice to improve the symptoms of the disease because of its peripheral side effects, causing cancer in both males and females in addition to the feminizing effect it has on males. As PD pathophysiology involves alteration in the expression levels of multiple LncRNAs, including metastatic-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), and as estrogen has been illustrated to control the expression of MALAT1 in multiple conditions, it is worth investigating the estrogen-MALAT1 interaction in Parkinson's disease to mimic its protective effect on the brain while avoiding its peripheral side effects. The following literature review suggests the potential regulation of MALAT1 by estrogen in PD, which would enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, improving the development of more tailored and effective treatments.",

However, the low spatial resolution of PET scans limits the accurate quantification of amyloid deposition due to partial volume effects (PVE). In this study, we propose a novel approach to addressing PVE using a latent diffusion model for resolution recovery (LDM-RR) of PET imaging. We leverage a synthetic data generation pipeline to create high-resolution PET digital phantoms for model training. The proposed LDM-RR model incorporates a weighted combination of L1, L2, and MS-SSIM losses at both noise and image scales to enhance MRI-guided reconstruction. We evaluated the model's performance in improving statistical power for detecting longitudinal changes and enhancing agreement between amyloid PET measurements from different tracers. The results demonstrate that the LDM-RR approach significantly improves PET quantification accuracy, reduces inter-tracer variability, and enhances the detection of subtle changes in amyloid deposition over time. We show that deep learning has the potential to improve PET quantification in AD, effectively contributing to the early detection and monitoring of disease progression.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex/multifactorial brain disorder involving hundreds of defective genes, epigenetic aberrations, cerebrovascular alterations, and environmental risk factors. The onset of the neurodegenerative process is triggered decades before the first symptoms appear, probably due to a combination of genomic and epigenetic phenomena. Therefore, the primary objective of any effective treatment is to intercept the disease process in its presymptomatic phases. Since the approval of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Tacrine, Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine) and Memantine, between 1993 and 2003, no new drug was approved by the FDA until the advent of immunotherapy with Aducanumab in 2021 and Lecanemab in 2023. Over the past decade, more than 10,000 new compounds with potential action on some pathogenic components of AD have been tested. The limitations of these anti-AD treatments have stimulated the search for multi-target (MT) drugs. In recent years, more than 1000 drugs with potential MT function have been studied in AD models. MT drugs aim to address the complex and multifactorial nature of the disease. This approach has the potential to offer more comprehensive benefits than single-target therapies, which may be limited in their effectiveness due to the intricate pathology of AD. A strategy still unexplored is the combination of epigenetic drugs with MT agents. Another option could be biotechnological products with pleiotropic action, among which nosustrophine-like compounds could represent an attractive, although not definitive, example.",

Intrinsic anatomic and metabolic differences related to male and female physiology have been described, underscoring the importance of considering biological sex in studying brain metabolism and associated pathologies. The hippocampus is a key structure exhibiting sex differences in volume and connectivity. Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, dendritic spine density, and electrophysiological plasticity contribute to the hippocampus' remarkable plasticity. Glucose transporters GLUT3 and GLUT4 are expressed in human hippocampal neurons, with proper glucose metabolism being crucial for learning and memory. Sex hormones play a major role, with the aromatase enzyme that generates estradiol increasing in neurons and astrocytes as an endogenous neuroprotective mechanism. Inhibition of aromatase increases gliosis and neurodegeneration after brain injury. Genetic variants of aromatase may confer higher Alzheimer's risk. Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women prevents hippocampal hypometabolism and preserves memory. Insulin is also a key regulator of hippocampal glucose metabolism and cognitive processes. Dysregulation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 may explain the comorbidity between type II diabetes and Alzheimer's. GLUT4 colocalizes with the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase IRAP in neuronal vesicles, suggesting an activity-dependent glucose uptake mechanism. Sex differences in brain metabolism are an important factor in understanding neurodegenerative diseases, and future research must elucidate the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications of these differences.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Alzheimer's Disease: In Vitro and In Vivo Evidence of Activation of the Plasma Bradykinin-Forming Cascade and Implications for Therapy.",
        "AbstractText": "The plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease are formed as a result of the aggregation of A\u03b2 peptides, which vary in length from 38 to 43 amino acids. The 1-40 peptide is the most abundant, while the 1-42 peptide appears to be the most destructive to neurons and/or glial cells in a variety of assays. We have demonstrated that aggregated A\u03b2, a state prior to plaque formation, will activate the plasma bradykinin-forming pathway when tested in vitro. Aggregation is zinc-dependent, optimal at 25-50 \u00b5M, and the rate of aggregation is paralleled by the rate of activation of the bradykinin-forming pathway as assessed by plasma kallikrein formation. The aggregation of A\u03b2 1-38, 1-40, and 1-42 is optimal after incubation for 3 days, 3 h, and under 1 min, respectively. The cascade is initiated by the autoactivation of factor XII upon binding to aggregated A\u03b2; then, prekallikrein is converted to kallikrein, which cleaves high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) to release bradykinin. Studies by a variety of other researchers have demonstrated the presence of each \"activation-step\" in either the plasma or spinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease, including activated factor XII, kallikrein, and bradykinin itself. There is also evidence that activation is more prominent as dementia worsens. We now have medications that can block each step of the bradykinin-forming pathway as currently employed for the therapy of hereditary angioedema. Given the current state of therapy for Alzheimer's disease, which includes monoclonal antibodies that retard the rate of progression by 30% at most and have significant side effects, it seems imperative to explore prophylaxis using one of the long-acting agents that target plasma kallikrein or factor XIIa. There is a long-acting bradykinin antagonist in development, and techniques to target kallikrein mRNA to lower levels or knock out the prekallikrein gene are being developed.",

The challenge with developing antibodies to treat neurological disorders is their poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration if the antibody must enter the brain, resulting in almost negligible brain bioavailability, requiring high dosing that can be toxic. Results: The reported efficacy of these drugs should also be reviewed, considering the placebo effects, since all antibodies have shown severe side effects that are not prevented by the placebo responses. In this critical and urgent advice to the FDA, I am suggesting a guideline amendment to all clinical trials requiring proof of sufficient brain bioavailability at the site of action, where it is known.

In order to achieve a diagnostic accuracy as high as possible, the diagnosis of AD during life depends on various biomarkers, including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Methods: Classical CSF AD biomarkers were determined in a total of 61 patients, classified as both beta amyloid- and tau-positive A+T+ (or A+T1+ according to the recently revised Alzheimer Association criteria for diagnosis and staging of AD). Twenty one of these patients fulfilled the criteria for mixed AD (mixed with Lewy bodies, cerebrovascular disease, or normal pressure hydrocephalus), whilst 40 had pure AD. Results: Patients did not differ with respect to gender, education, disease duration, and cognitive status. After controlling for confounding factors, no difference was observed between mixed and pure AD groups in A\u03b242 or A\u03b242/A\u03b240 levels. Although by definition, patients of both groups had abnormal (increased) levels of phospho-tau181, the mixed AD group presented with lower (less abnormal) levels of phospho-tau181 and total tau as compared to the pure group.

The best candidate was then evaluated for longer exposure to assess non-cognitive symptoms, cognition, and pathology. Methods: Tg4510 mice, expressing mutated human tau (P301L), were administered with levetiracetam, methylphenidate, diazepam, and quetiapine for 7 days at 6 months old, when pathology and cognitive deficits are established.

The current study explored the feasibility of combining an exploratory proteomic strategy and confirmatory ligand-binding assays to screen for and validate biomarker candidates for neurodegenerative disorders. METHODS: It analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis and healthy controls using an exploratory antibody microarray and validatory ligand-binding assays. RESULTS: The screening antibody microarray identified differentially expressed proteins between patients with neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls, including cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), osteopontin, and vascular endothelial growth factor 165b.

This study investigates the effects of semaglutide (SEM), a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, on cognitive function and anxiety-like behavior in a transgenic murine model of AD. METHODS: 20 mice were randomly distributed into the following groups (n = 5): (WT + VEH) group: C57BL/6J + saline, (WT + SEM) group: C57BL/6J + semaglutide, (AD + VEH) group: AD + saline, (AD + SEM) group: AD + semaglutide. The animals underwent a four-week treatment, during which we monitored blood glucose levels, body weight, and responses in an open field test, novel object recognition test, social chamber test, and 0-maze test. RESULTS: Post-treatment, SEM significantly reduced blood glucose levels in AD mice, aligning them with those of wild-type controls. Cognitive assessments indicated an improvement in the investigation index for SEM-treated mice compared to those receiving a vehicle, suggesting cognitive benefits. Although SEM did not significantly enhance motor and exploratory activities, it displayed a potential anxiolytic effect, particularly evident in the combined anxiety index, with notable differences observed before and after treatment in the AD group.

METHODS: This paper is a review and discussion of the published literature. RESULTS: Animal studies have shown BPA to be a broad-spectrum endocrine disruptor. BPA is metabolized via the glucuronidation pathway, which involves the addition of glucose to the target molecule, and is catalyzed by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). Evidence of compromised glucuronidation has been found for ASD, DHD, PD, and PCOS. Genetic polymorphisms that alter the catalytic activity of the UGTs and efflux transporters involved are common. There are two ways to interpret the findings of associations between BPA glucuronidation efficiency and disease, a 'direct' pathway and an 'indirect' pathway. With the 'direct' pathway, free BPA is the actual causative agent. Compromised BPA detoxification leads to higher concentrations of free BPA in vulnerable tissues. Decreased BPA detoxification leads to increased exposure of vulnerable tissues to free BPA, where it can function as an endocrine disruptor. With the 'indirect' pathway, BPA is not the causative agent. BPA serves as a marker for the decreased glucuronidation efficiency of another unknown compound of endogenous origin detoxified by a similar combination of UGTs and efflux transporters as BPA. It is this compound(s), acting as an endocrine disruptor, that leads to a metabolic environment that favors disease development over an extended time period. CONCLUSION: A review of the existing literature supports the indirect 'marker' hypothesis over the 'direct' hypothesis.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Role of Microbiota-Derived Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) in Modulating the Gut-Brain Axis: Implications for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease Pathogenesis.",
        "AbstractText": "Microbiota-derived hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays a crucial role in modulating the gut-brain axis, with significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. H2S is produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria in the gut and acts as a critical signaling molecule influencing brain health via various pathways, including regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune responses. H2S maintains gut barrier integrity at physiological levels and prevents systemic inflammation, which could impact neuroinflammation. However, as H2S has a dual role or a Janus face, excessive H2S production, often resulting from gut dysbiosis, can compromise the intestinal barrier and exacerbate neurodegenerative processes by promoting neuroinflammation and glial cell dysfunction. This imbalance is linked to the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, where the overproduction of H2S exacerbates beta-amyloid deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and alpha-synuclein aggregation, driving neuroinflammatory responses and neuronal damage. Targeting gut microbiota to restore H2S homeostasis through dietary interventions, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation presents a promising therapeutic approach. By rebalancing the microbiota-derived H2S, these strategies may mitigate neurodegeneration and offer novel treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, underscoring the critical role of the gut-brain axis in maintaining central nervous system health.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, imposed in many countries in 2021, led to social isolation and the interruption of many activities that were useful in stimulating cognition. The impact of these changes has been particularly severe in older subjects with cognitive impairment. METHODS: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of lockdown on Alzheimer's disease patients (in cognition, behavior, and autonomy) and on their caregivers (in emotions, burden, and quality of life). We created a questionnaire and performed an extensive semi-structured telephone interview with each caregiver. The main outcomes were (1) changes in cognitive and behavioral symptoms and autonomy levels in the patients and (2) effects on caregivers' emotions, burden, and quality of life. RESULTS: The lockdown severely impaired patients' cognition and independence and worsened behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. These effects contributed to increasing caregivers' burden and stress levels, with a significant perceived deterioration in quality of life among caregivers with higher education levels (p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: This study might contribute to our understanding of the impact of lockdown on Alzheimer's disease patients and their caregivers, to guide future public health interventions aimed at preventing and/or reducing the consequences of similar extraordinary events in frail subjects.",

It is expressed in various body fluids and regions of the central nervous system. ApoD's roles in neuroprotection, lipid transport, and anti-inflammatory processes are crucial as far as the prevention of neurodegenerative pathologies is concerned. This review aims to summarize the background knowledge on ApoD, and it covers studies indexed in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. It discusses the evidence for the multifaceted roles of ApoD in the mechanisms and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that significantly affects middle-aged and elderly adults, leading to cognitive deterioration and hindering daily activities. Notwithstanding progress, conventional diagnostic techniques continue to be susceptible to inaccuracies and inefficiencies. Timely and precise diagnosis is essential for early intervention. METHODS: We present an enhanced hybrid deep learning framework that amalgamates the EfficientNetV2B3 with Inception-ResNetV2 models. The models were integrated using an adaptive weight selection process informed by the Cuckoo Search optimization algorithm. The procedure commences with the pre-processing of neuroimaging data to guarantee quality and uniformity. Features are subsequently retrieved from the neuroimaging data by utilizing the EfficientNetV2B3 and Inception-ResNetV2 models. The Cuckoo Search algorithm allocates weights to various models dynamically, contingent upon their efficacy in particular diagnostic tasks. The framework achieves balanced usage of the distinct characteristics of both models through the iterative optimization of the weight configuration. This method improves classification accuracy, especially for early-stage Alzheimer's disease. A thorough assessment was conducted on extensive neuroimaging datasets to verify the framework's efficacy. RESULTS: The framework attained a Scott's Pi agreement score of 0.9907, indicating exceptional diagnostic accuracy and dependability, especially in identifying the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. The results show its superiority over current state-of-the-art techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the substantial potential of the proposed framework as a reliable and scalable instrument for the identification of Alzheimer's disease. This method effectively mitigates the shortcomings of conventional diagnostic techniques and current deep learning algorithms by utilizing the complementing capabilities of EfficientNetV2B3 and Inception-ResNetV2 by using an optimized weight selection mechanism. The adaptive characteristics of the Cuckoo Search optimization facilitate its application across many diagnostic circumstances, hence extending its utility to a wider array of neuroimaging datasets. The capacity to accurately identify early-stage Alzheimer's disease is essential for facilitating prompt therapies, which are crucial for decelerating disease development and enhancing patient outcomes.",

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is critical for better management and treatment outcomes, but it remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of the disease. Clinical data, including a range of cognitive, functional, and demographic variables, play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease classification. Also, challenges such as data imbalance and high-dimensional feature sets often hinder model performance. Objective: This paper aims to propose a computationally efficient, reliable, and transparent machine learning-based framework for the classification of Alzheimer's disease patients.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the progressive accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain. These pathological aggregates interfere with neuronal function, leading to the disruption of cognitive processes, particularly memory. The deposition of A\u03b2 forms senile plaques, while tau protein, in its hyperphosphorylated state, forms neurofibrillary tangles, both of which contribute to the underlying neurodegeneration observed in AD. Rosmarinic acid (RosA), a natural compound found in plants such as Rosmarinus officinalis, is known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, RosA holds promise as a nutritional supplement that may support brain health. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate the impact of RosA on the structural stability of A\u03b2 peptides. The results indicated that the addition of RosA increased the instability of A\u03b2, as evidenced by an increase in the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), a decrease in the Radius of Gyration (Rg), and an expansion of the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA). This destabilization is primarily attributed to the disruption of native hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions in the presence of two RosA molecules. The free energy landscape (FEL) analysis and MM-PBSA (Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area Mechanics) results further support the notion that RosA can effectively bind to the hydrophobic pocket of the protein, highlighting its potential as a nutritional component that may contribute to maintaining brain health and function.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two diseases highly prevalent in the aging population and often co-occur. The exact relationship between the two diseases is uncertain, though epidemiological studies have demonstrated that CVDs appear to increase the risk of AD and vice versa. This scoping review aims to examine the current identified overlapping genetics between CVDs and AD at the individual gene level and at the shared pathway level. METHODS: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines for a scoping review, we searched the PubMed and Scopus databases from 1990 to October 2024 for articles that involved (1) CVDs, (2) AD, and (3) used statistical methods to parse genetic relationships. RESULTS: Our search yielded 2918 articles, of which 274 articles passed screening and were organized into two main sections: (1) evidence of shared genetic risk; and (2) shared mechanisms. The genes APOE, PSEN1, and PSEN2 reportedly have wide effects across the AD and CVD spectrum, affecting both cardiac and brain tissues. Mechanistically, changes in three main pathways (lipid metabolism, blood pressure regulation, and the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)) contribute to subclinical and etiological changes that promote both AD and CVD progression. However, genetic studies continue to be limited by the availability of longitudinal data and lack of cohorts that are representative of diverse populations. CONCLUSIONS: Highly penetrant familial genes simultaneously increase the risk of CVDs and AD. However, in most cases, sets of dysregulated genes within larger-scale mechanisms, like changes in lipid metabolism, blood pressure regulation, and BBB breakdown, increase the risk of both AD and CVDs and contribute to disease progression.",

Traditional diagnostics like neuroimaging and clinical evaluations are often subjective, costly, and inaccessible, especially in resource-poor settings. Previous research has focused on speech analysis primarily conducted using English data, leaving multilingual settings unexplored. METHODS: In this study, we present our results from the INTERSPEECH 2024 TAUKADIAL Challenge, where we aimed to automatically detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and predict cognitive scores for English and Chinese speakers (169 in total). Our approach leverages Whisper, a speech foundation model, to extract language-agnostic speech embeddings. We then utilize ensemble models to incorporate task-specific information. RESULTS: Our model achieved unweighted average recall of 81.83% in an MCI classification task, and root mean squared error of 1.196 in cognitive score prediction task, which placed the model at the second and the first position, respectively, in the ranking for each task. Comparison between language-agnostic and language-specific models reveals the importance of capturing language-specific nuances for accurate cognitive impairment prediction.

In mental imagery (MI) technique, motor acts are mentally rehearsed without any overt body movements. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of MI on the quality of life, cognitive, and emotional status of older adults with an early stage of dementia. METHODS: The present randomized controlled trial consisted of 160 participants. The sample from an Athens Day Care Center of the Alzheimer Association was randomized to (a) the MI and exercise group (intervention group, n = 55), (b) the only exercise group (1st control group, n = 52), and (c) the neither MI nor exercise group (2nd control group, n = 53). Participants engaged in a total of 24 physiotherapy sessions, each lasting approximately 45 min, scheduled twice weekly over a 12-week period. They performed three assessments: (a) one week prior to the program, (b) one and a half months, and (c) after the program. The intervention group performed a 30 min MI with exercise program content immediately following every physiotherapy exercise session. Walking While Talking Test (WWITT), the Euro-Qol 5-Dimensions 5-Level of severity scale (Euro-Qol 5D-5L scale), the Short-Form of Geriatric Depression Scale (SF-GDS), and the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST) were used to assess cognitive status, emotional status, and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 160 participants (43 men, 117 women, with MMSE M = 23.20 SD = 0.15) took part in this study in which most reported holding a university degree (n = 77), were married (n = 101), and had loss of memory as the 1st symptom of dementia (n= 117).

        "AbstractText": "Astrocytes, vital support cells in the central nervous system (CNS), are crucial for maintaining neuronal health. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), astrocytes play a key role in clearing toxic amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides. A\u03b2, a potent neuroinflammatory trigger, stimulates astrocytes to release excessive glutamate and inflammatory factors, exacerbating neuronal dysfunction and death. Recent studies underscore the role of Rho GTPases-particularly RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42-in regulating A\u03b2 clearance and neuroinflammation. These key regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular signaling pathways function independently through distinct mechanisms but may converge to modulate inflammatory responses. Their influence on astrocyte structure and function extends to regulating endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) activity, which modulates vasoactive peptides such as endothelin-1 (ET-1). Through these processes, Rho GTPases impact vascular permeability and neuroinflammation, contributing to AD pathogenesis by affecting both A\u03b2 clearance and cerebrovascular interactions. Understanding the interplay between Rho GTPases and the cerebrovascular system provides fresh insights into AD pathogenesis. Targeting Rho GTPase signaling pathways in astrocytes could offer a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate neuroinflammation, enhance A\u03b2 clearance, and slow disease progression, ultimately improving cognitive outcomes in AD patients.",

METHODS: Participants with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA; \"visual-variant Alzheimer's\"; n = 11), typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD; N = 10), and controls (n = 13) repeatedly walked down routes within a simplified real-world setting. Participant groups were of comparable age and gender. Routes were of different complexity (straight, U-shaped, and S-shaped), overhead lighting levels (low and high) and with or without a dynamic LED (light-emitting diode) cue (trial n = 24). Ratios of walking times for each experimental condition (each complex route vs the straight route, high lighting vs low, and LED cue vs no cue) were compared between participant groups. Kinematic measures were produced from a total of 10,813 steps using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs). RESULTS: The walking time ratios relating to route complexity were higher in the PCA group than in controls: 30.3% (95% CI [13.5%, 49.5%] higher for U-shaped vs straight and 31.9% [21.1%, 55.3%] for S-shaped vs straight, averaged over other conditions).

Effective blood glucose management is essential, and sitagliptin (SITG), a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, may offer neuroprotective benefits in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: T2DM was induced in rats using nicotinamide (NICO) and streptozotocin (STZ), and biomarkers of AD and DM-linked enzymes, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were evaluated in the brain. Computational studies supported the in vivo findings. RESULTS: SITG significantly reduced the brain enzyme levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1), DPP-4, and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) in T2DM-induced rats. It also reduced inflammation by lowering cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). Additionally, SITG improved oxidative stress markers by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhancing glutathione (GSH). It increased anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2) while reducing pro-apoptotic markers such as Bcl-2-associated X (BAX) and Caspace-3. SITG also lowered blood glucose levels and improved plasma insulin levels. To explore potential molecular level mechanisms, docking was performed on AChE, COX-2, GSK-3\u03b2, BACE-1, and Caspace-3. The potential binding affinity of SITG for the above-mentioned target enzymes were 10.8, 8.0, 9.7, 7.7, and 7.9 kcal/mol, respectively, comparable to co-crystallized ligands. Further binding mode analysis of the lowest energy conformation revealed interactions with the critical residues. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight SITG's neuroprotective molecular targets in T2DM-associated neurodegeneration and its potential as a therapeutic approach for AD, warranting further clinical investigations.",

METHODS: A systematic search was performed across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, to identify relevant meta-analyses and cohort studies. Studies were included if they reported effect sizes (odds ratios [ORs] or relative risks [RRs]) for the association between TBI, its severity, and the risk of dementia or AD. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models to account for heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of six studies were included in the analysis. The pooled results showed that TBI significantly increases the risk of dementia, with an overall odds ratio of 1.81 (95% CI: 1.53-2.14). Mild TBI was associated with a modest increase in dementia risk (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.70-2.26), while moderate-to-severe TBI showed a stronger association (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.55-2.45). In contrast, the association between TBI and AD was less consistent, with the pooled OR for AD being 1.18 (at 95% CI: 1.11-1.25) for mild TBI; however, in several studies, no significant association was observed (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.91-1.15). The results also indicated substantial heterogeneity across studies, particularly in relation to AD outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this umbrella meta-analysis confirm that TBI is a significant risk factor for dementia, with more severe TBIs conferring a higher risk. While mild TBIs also increase the risk of dementia, the effect is more pronounced in moderate-to-severe injuries. The evidence linking TBI to AD is less robust, with inconsistent findings across studies. Clinicians should consider long-term cognitive screening and management for individuals with a history of TBI, particularly those with moderate-to-severe injuries.",

Mice were then perfused, and brain samples were processed for histology and protein assays. Brain homogenates were analyzed for BDNF and its downstream signaling molecules. RESULTS: Open field testing demonstrated that 3xTg-AD mice spent more time in the center than B6 mice. 3xTg-AD-Sham mice injected with ANA12 were the only group to travel significantly less distance than B6-ANA12-Sham or B6-Vehicle-Sham mice (p < 0.05), while 3xTg-AD-rTMS mice (irrespective of injection) were not significantly different from B6 mice. 3xTg-AD mice had significantly greater measured levels of BDNF and TrkB than the wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of Alzheimer's disease using rTMS positively affects elements of hypoactivity, but not all behavioral abnormalities. rTMS shifted 3xTg-AD open field behavioral test measures, generating significant differences between untreated 3xTg-AD and B6 genotypes. Despite its benefit, further investigation of rTMS as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease as well as its biological underpinnings are needed.",

        "AbstractText": "Accurate identification and functional annotation of splicing isoforms and non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), alongside full-length protein-encoding transcripts, are critical for understanding gene (mis)regulation and metabolic reprogramming in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to provide a comprehensive and accurate transcriptome resource to improve existing AD transcript databases. Background/Objectives: Gene mis-regulation and metabolic reprogramming play a key role in AD, yet existing transcript databases lack accurate and comprehensive identification of splicing isoforms and lncRNAs. This study aims to generate a refined transcriptome dataset, expanding the understanding of AD onset and progression. Methods: Publicly available RNA-seq data from pre-AD and AD tissues were utilized. Advanced bioinformatics tools were applied to assemble and annotate full-length transcripts, including splicing isoforms and lncRNAs, with an emphasis on correcting errors and enhancing annotation accuracy. Results: A significantly improved transcriptome dataset was generated, which includes detailed annotations of splicing isoforms and lncRNAs. This dataset expands the scope of existing AD transcript databases and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. The findings demonstrate that the refined dataset captures more relevant details about AD progression compared to publicly available data. Conclusions: The newly developed transcriptome resource and the associated analysis tools offer a valuable contribution to AD research, providing deeper insights into the disease's molecular mechanisms. This work supports future research into gene regulation and metabolic reprogramming in AD and serves as a foundation for exploring novel therapeutic targets.",

        "AbstractText": "We previously reported that membrane-type 5-matrix metalloproteinase (MT5-MMP) deficiency not only reduces pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 5xFAD (Tg) mice in vivo but also impairs interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2)-mediated neuroinflammation and A\u03b2 production in primary Tg immature neural cell cultures after 11 days in vitro. We now investigate the effect of MT5-MMP on incipient pathogenic pathways that are activated in cortical primary cultures at 21-24 days in vitro (DIV), during which time neurons are organized into a functional mature network. Using wild-type (WT), MT5-MMP-/- (MT5-/-), 5xFAD (Tg), and 5xFADxMT5-MMP-/- (TgMT5-/-) mice, we generated primary neuronal cultures that were exposed to IL-1\u03b2 and/or different proteolytic system inhibitors. We assessed neuroinflammation, APP metabolism, synaptic integrity, and electrophysiological properties using biochemical, imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp approaches. The absence of MT5-MMP impaired the IL-1\u03b2-mediated induction of inflammatory genes in TgMT5-/- cells compared to Tg cells. Furthermore, the reduced density of dendritic spines in Tg neurons was also prevented in TgMT5-/- neurons. IL-1\u03b2 caused a strong decrease in the dendritic spine density of WT neurons, which was prevented in MT5-/- neurons. However, the latter exhibited fewer spines than the WT under untreated conditions. The spontaneous rhythmic firing frequency of the network was increased in MT5-/- neurons, but not in TgMT5-/- neurons, and IL-1\u03b2 increased this parameter only in Tg neurons. In terms of induced somatic excitability, Tg and TgMT5-/- neurons exhibited lower excitability than WT and MT5-/-, while IL-1\u03b2 impaired excitability only in non-AD backgrounds. The synaptic strength of miniature global synaptic currents was equivalent in all genotypes but increased dramatically in WT and MT5-/- neurons after IL-1\u03b2. MT5-MMP deficiency decreased endogenous and overexpressed C83 and C99 levels but did not affect A\u03b2 levels. C99 appears to be cleared by several pathways, including \u03b3-secretase, the autophagolysosomal system, and also \u03b1-secretase, via its conversion to C83. In summary, this study confirms that MT5-MMP is a pivotal factor affecting not only neuroinflammation and APP metabolism but also synaptogenesis and synaptic activity at early stages of the pathology, and reinforces the relevance of targeting MT5-MMP to fight AD.",

It is characterized by cognitive impairment and dementia due to abnormal levels of amyloid beta peptide (A\u03b2) and axonal Tau protein in the brain. However, the complex underlying mechanisms affecting this disease are not yet known, and there is a lack of standardized biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Therefore, in this study, by means of bioinformatics analysis, AD-affected brain tissue was analyzed using the GSE138260 dataset, identifying 612 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional analysis revealed 388 upregulated DEGs associated with sensory perception and 224 downregulated DEGs linked to the regulation and modulation of synaptic processes. Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified 20 hub genes. Furthermore, miRNA target gene networks revealed 1767 miRNAs linked to hub genes, among which hsa-mir-106a-5p, hsa-mir-17-5p, hsa-mir-26a-5p, hsa-mir-27a-3p and hsa-mir-34a-5p were the most relevant.

        "AbstractText": "Alcohol consumption is believed to affect Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but the contributing mechanisms are not well understood. A potential mediator of the proposed alcohol-AD connection is autophagy, a degradation pathway that maintains organelle and protein homeostasis. Autophagy is regulated through the activity of Transcription factor EB (TFEB), which promotes lysosome and autophagy-related gene expression. The purpose of this study is to explore whether chronic alcohol consumption worsens the age-related decline in TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis in the brain and exacerbates cognitive decline associated with aging. To explore the effect of alcohol on brain TFEB and autophagy, we exposed young (3-month-old) and aged (23-month-old) mice to two alcohol-feeding paradigms and assessed biochemical, transcriptome, histology, and behavioral endpoints. In young mice, alcohol decreased hippocampal nuclear TFEB staining but increased SQSTM1/p62, LC3-II, ubiquitinated proteins, and phosphorylated Tau. Hippocampal TFEB activity was lower in aged mice than it was in young mice, and Gao-binge alcohol feeding did not worsen the age-related reduction in TFEB activity. Morris Water and Barnes Maze spatial memory tasks were used to characterize the effects of aging and chronic alcohol exposure (mice fed alcohol for 4 weeks). The aged mice showed worse spatial memory acquisition in both tests. Alcohol feeding slightly impaired spatial memory in the young mice, but had little effect or even slightly improved spatial memory acquisition in the aged mice. In conclusion, aging produces greater reductions in brain autophagy flux and impairment of spatial memory than alcohol consumption.",

        "AbstractText": "Regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD), specific neuronal populations and brain regions exhibit selective vulnerability. Understanding the basis of this selective neuronal and regional vulnerability is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathology. However, progress in this area is currently hindered by the incomplete understanding of the intricate functional and spatial diversity of neuronal subtypes in the human brain. Previous studies have demonstrated that neuronal subpopulations with high neuropeptide (NP) co-expression are disproportionately absent in the entorhinal cortex of AD brains at the single-cell level, and there is a significant decline in hippocampal NP expression in naturally aging human brains. Given the role of NPs in neuroprotection and the maintenance of microenvironments, we hypothesize that neurons expressing higher levels of NPs (HNP neurons) possess unique functional characteristics that predispose them to cellular abnormalities, which can manifest as degeneration in AD with aging. To test this hypothesis, multiscale and spatiotemporal transcriptome data from ~1900 human brain samples were analyzed using publicly available datasets. The results indicate that HNP neurons experienced greater metabolic burden and were more prone to protein misfolding. The observed decrease in neuronal abundance during stages associated with a higher risk of AD, coupled with the age-related decline in the expression of AD-associated neuropeptides (ADNPs), provides temporal evidence supporting the role of NPs in the progression of AD. Additionally, the localization of ADNP-producing HNP neurons in AD-associated brain regions provides neuroanatomical support for the concept that cellular/neuronal composition is a key factor in regional AD vulnerability. This study offers novel insights into the molecular and cellular basis of selective neuronal and regional vulnerability to AD in human brains.",

        "AbstractText": "Based on the established neuroprotective properties of indole-based compounds and their significant potential as multi-targeted therapeutic agents, a series of synthetic indole-phenolic compounds was evaluated as multifunctional neuroprotectors. Each compound demonstrated metal-chelating properties, particularly in sequestering copper ions, with quantitative analysis revealing approximately 40% chelating activity across all the compounds. In cellular models, these hybrid compounds exhibited strong antioxidant and cytoprotective effects, countering reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the A\u03b2(25-35) peptide and its oxidative byproduct, hydrogen peroxide, as demonstrated by quantitative analysis showing on average a 25% increase in cell viability and a reduction in ROS levels to basal states. Further analysis using thioflavin T fluorescence assays, circular dichroism, and computational studies indicated that the synthesized derivatives effectively promoted the self-disaggregation of the A\u03b2(25-35) fragment. Taken together, these findings suggest a unique profile of neuroprotective actions for indole-phenolic derivatives, combining chelating, antioxidant, and anti-aggregation properties, which position them as promising compounds for the development of multifunctional agents in Alzheimer's disease therapy. The methods used provide reliable in vitro data, although further in vivo validation and assessment of blood-brain barrier penetration are needed to confirm therapeutic efficacy and safety.",

Despite decades of research efforts, there is still no effective cure for this debilitating condition. AD research has increasingly focused on transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) as a potential therapeutic target. NRF2 plays a crucial role in protecting cells and tissues from environmental stressors, such as electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. Recently, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that NRF2 is a key regulator in AD pathology. NRF2 is highly expressed in microglia, resident macrophages in the central nervous system, and contributes to neuroinflammation, phagocytosis and neurodegeneration in AD. NRF2 has been reported to modulate microglia-induced inflammation and facilitate the transition from homeostatic microglia to a disease-associated microglia subset. Genetic and pharmacological activation of NRF2 has been demonstrated to improve cognitive function. Here, we review the current understanding of the involvement of NRF2 in AD and the critical role that NRF2 plays in microglia in the context of AD. Our aim is to highlight the potential of targeting NRF2 in the microglia as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating the progression of AD.",

The lack of effective treatments to halt or reverse the progression of this disease has prompted a search for non-pharmaceutical tools. Modulation of the gut microbiota may be a promising strategy in this regard. This review aims to determine whether specific dietary interventions, particularly antioxidant vitamins, either obtained from the diet or as supplements, may support the formation of beneficial microbiota in order to prevent AD development by contributing to the systemic reduction of chronic inflammation or by acting locally in the gut.

        "AbstractText": "A shared hallmark of age-related neurodegenerative diseases is the chronic activation of innate immune cells, which actively contributes to the neurodegenerative process. In Alzheimer's disease, this inflammatory milieu exacerbates both amyloid and tau pathology. A similar abnormal inflammatory response has been reported in Parkinson's disease, with elevated levels of cytokines and other inflammatory intermediates derived from activated glial cells, which promote the progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Understanding the causes that support this aberrant inflammatory response has become a topic of growing interest and research in neurodegeneration, with high translational potential. It has been postulated that the phenotypic shift of immune cells towards a proinflammatory state combined with the presence of immunogenic cell death fuels a vicious cycle in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role. Mitochondria and mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species are downstream effectors of different inflammatory signaling pathways, including inflammasomes. Dysfunctional mitochondria are also recognized as important producers of damage-associated molecular patterns, which can amplify the immune response. Here, we review the major findings highlighting the role of mitochondria as a checkpoint of neuroinflammation and immunogenic cell deaths in neurodegenerative diseases. The knowledge of these processes may help to find new druggable targets to modulate the inflammatory response.",

        "AbstractText": "Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and histone demethylases (HDMs) are critical enzymes that regulate chromatin dynamics and gene expression through the addition and removal of methyl groups on histone proteins. HMTs, such as PRC2 and SETD2, are involved in the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 and lysine 36, influencing gene silencing and activation. Dysregulation of these enzymes often leads to abnormal gene expression and contributes to tumorigenesis. In contrast, HDMs including KDM7A and KDM2A reverse these methylation marks, and their dysfunction can drive disease progression. In cancer, the aberrant activity of specific HMTs and HDMs can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes or the activation of oncogenes, facilitating tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Conversely, in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), disruptions in histone methylation dynamics are associated with neuronal loss, altered gene expression, and disease progression. We aimed to comprehend the odd activity of HMTs and HDMs and how they contribute to disease pathogenesis, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets.

In Canada and elsewhere, family members commonly see loved ones living with dementia experience difficult moments, including anxiety, stress, and fear. Struggling health care systems strive to apply the latest evidence-based interventions. In this case report, we explore how individuals who care for people with dementia can help redirect difficult personal and interpersonal moments towards hopeful moments in the presence of therapy dogs. The cases of four individuals diagnosed with dementia and interacting with therapy dog intervention in one of three environments-at a family home, in a hospital awaiting placement to a long-term care facility, and in a psychiatric centre-are reviewed from the perspectives of two attending therapy dog handlers. In addition to being researchers in the therapy dog field and authors on this case report, both handlers were guided in a 110 min focused conversational method by a third author, from which self-affirmation theory surfaced as a guiding framework for explaining their observations and experiences. Therapy dog visiting appears to facilitate positive social interactions that can help redirect difficult moments to moments defined by self-affirmation or experiencing a positive sense of self. This is an under-recognized association in the dementia literature. Self-affirmation is demonstrated through four themes during therapy dog visits: (a) physical movement, (b) psychological shift, (c) a transition in the experience of time, and (d) connective interactions. Therapy dogs are identified here as a promising self-affirming psychosocial intervention for individuals with dementia and their caregivers worthy of further research and practice attention.",

Previous studies have indicated that individuals with mild cognitive impairment have an elevated risk of progressing to Alzheimer's disease. The hippocampus is well known to play pivotal roles in memory and cognitive functions. Scopolamine (Sco) disrupts cholinergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and triggers functional declines in memory and cognition. SHCog\u2122 is a commercially available alpha glycerophosphorylcholine (\u03b1-GPC) derived from soybean lecithin. The objective of the present study was to examine whether SHCog\u2122 can alleviate memory and cognitive dysfunctions in a mouse model of cognitive impairments induced by Sco. In this study, C57BL/6\u202fJ mice were subjected to the passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests to investigate short-term and spatial memory functions, respectively. This study also examined cellular morphology and distribution by cresyl violet staining and investigated changes in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) as cholinergic enzymes through immunohistochemical staining of the hippocampus. Additionally, we examined changes in postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) related to neural plasticity in the hippocampus. Treatment with SHCog\u2122 (125\u202fmg/kg and 250\u202fmg/kg) brought functional recovery in short-term and spatial memory against Sco-induced memory and cognitive impairments. Changes in cellular morphology and distribution in the hippocampus were not detected following the administration of Sco and/or SHCog\u2122. Treatment with SHCog\u2122 reduced AChE elevated by Sco, whereas SHCog\u2122 administration increased ChAT decreased by Sco. Furthermore, SHCog\u2122 restored PSD-95 and BDNF in the mouse hippocampus reduced by Sco. Specifically, SHCog\u2122 modulated cholinergic neurotransmission and enhanced neural plasticity in the hippocampus.

Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-11 (SIGLEC-11) is a human lineage-specific microglial cell surface receptor that recognizes \u03b1-2-8-linked oligo-/polysialylated glycomolecules with inhibitory effects on the microglial inflammatory pathways. Recently, the SIGLEC11 gene locus was prioritized as a top tier microglial gene with potential causality to Alzheimer's disease, although its role in inflammation and neurodegeneration remains poorly understood. In this study, aged Siglec-11 transgenic (tg) mice, which expressed the human SIGLEC-11 receptor on microglia and tissue macrophages, were investigated. The brains of the Siglec-11 tg mice were analyzed in 6-month-old mature mice and 24-month-old aged mice using immunohistochemistry and transcriptomics. Results showed decreased density and fewer clusters of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)-positive microglial cells in the hippocampus and substantia nigra, as well as less lipid-laden microglia in the Siglec-11 tg in comparison to wildtype (WT) controls. Additionally, Siglec-11 tg mice exhibited less age-related neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta in comparison to WT mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and inflammatory pathways in Siglec-11 tg brains at 6\u202fmonths, with further suppression of complement and coagulation cascades at 24\u202fmonths of age in comparison to WT mice.

Yet, we still lack sensitive tools for stratifying patients early, resulting in patients being undiagnosed or wrongly diagnosed. Despite rapid expansion in machine learning models for dementia prediction, limited model interpretability and generalizability impede translation to the clinic. METHODS: We build a robust and interpretable predictive prognostic model (PPM) and validate its clinical utility using real-world, routinely-collected, non-invasive, and low-cost (cognitive tests, structural MRI) patient data. To enhance scalability and generalizability to the clinic, we: 1) train the PPM with clinically-relevant predictors (cognitive tests, grey matter atrophy) that are common across research and clinical cohorts, 2) test PPM predictions with independent multicenter real-world data from memory clinics across countries (UK, Singapore). FINDINGS: PPM robustly predicts (accuracy: 81.66%, AUC: 0.84, sensitivity: 82.38%, specificity: 80.94%) whether patients at early disease stages (MCI) will remain stable or progress to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). PPM generalizes from research to real-world patient data across memory clinics and its predictions are validated against longitudinal clinical outcomes. PPM allows us to derive an individualized AI-guided multimodal marker (i.e. predictive prognostic index) that predicts progression to AD more precisely than standard clinical markers (grey matter atrophy, cognitive scores; PPM-derived marker: hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a03.42, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) or clinical diagnosis (PPM-derived marker: hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a02.84, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), reducing misdiagnosis. INTERPRETATION: Our results provide evidence for a robust and explainable clinical AI-guided marker for early dementia prediction that is validated against longitudinal, multicenter patient data across countries, and has strong potential for adoption in clinical practice.

        "ArticleTitle": "12-month neurological and psychiatric outcomes of semaglutide use for type 2 diabetes: a propensity-score matched cohort study.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: While semaglutide, approved for type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is being investigated as a treatment for brain disorders, concerns over adverse neuropsychiatric events have emerged. More data are therefore needed to assess the effects of semaglutide on brain health. This study provides robust estimates of the risk of neurological and psychiatric outcomes following semaglutide use compared to three other antidiabetic medications. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records from TriNetX US Collaborative Network, covering >100 million patients in the USA. Due to the exploratory nature of this study, we did not use a pre-registered protocol or statistical analysis plan. Three cohorts with T2DM prescribed semaglutide between 1st December 2017 and 31st May 2021 were propensity-score matched (1:1 using a greedy nearest-neighbour algorithm with calliper distance of 0.1) with cohorts receiving sitagliptin, empagliflozin, and glipizide. Using Cox regression analysis, we compared the risks of 22 neurological and psychiatric outcomes within one year since the index prescription: encephalitis, parkinsonism, cognitive deficit, dementia, epilepsy/seizure, migraine, insomnia, nerve disorder, myoneural junction/muscle disease, intracranial haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, cannabis misuse, stimulants misuse, nicotine misuse, psychosis, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suicidality. Negative control outcomes (NCOs) were used to assess unmeasured confounding. FINDINGS: Each matched cohort included 23,386 (semaglutide vs sitagliptin), 22,584 (vs empagliflozin), and 19,206 (vs glipizide) patients. Semaglutide was not associated with an increased risk of neurological and psychiatric outcomes. Instead, after multiple-testing correction, semaglutide was associated with reduced risk for several such outcomes, notably cognitive deficit compared to sitagliptin (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.80) and glipizide (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.81), dementia compared to sitagliptin (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.40-0.68), and nicotine misuse across most comparisons (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.85 against glipizide; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.90 against empagliflozin; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.95 against sitagliptin, though the latter was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons). Empagliflozin showed fewest differences from semaglutide. No differences in NCOs were observed between cohorts. INTERPRETATION: Semaglutide is not associated with higher 12-month risk of adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes compared to other antidiabetic medications. Potential beneficial associations with some outcomes, especially cognitive deficit and nicotine misuse, should stimulate validation in clinical trials.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: As a key inflammatory factor, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulation of NLRP3 signaling can trigger various inflammatory responses in the brain, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as ischemic stroke, vascular dementia (VaD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, the NLRP3 signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including VaD. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of a synthetic sulfonylurea NLRP3 inhibitor, AMS-17, in a VaD mouse model using bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. All mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, VaD + Vehicle, and VaD + AMS-17. Cognitive function was assessed using the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) on the 50th day after BCAS. Brain sections and blood serum samples were collected for biomarker analysis and immunohistochemistry. Neurodegeneration, expressions of the molecules involved in the NLRP3 signaling pathways, tight junction proteins, and myelination were assessed using western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF). The levels of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the blood were measured using ELISA. RESULTS: AMS-17 treatment improved cognitive function, enhanced blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and promoted remyelination in VaD mice. Additionally, AMS-17 reduced neurodegeneration and decreased the expression of NLRP3 and its associated proteins, Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and cleaved caspase-1 in the brain. It also lowered pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels, while increasing the anti-inflammatory IL-4 level in the blood. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide the first promising evidence for the use of AMS-17 in VaD treatment in mice. This study introduces AMS-17 as a novel chemical scaffold with NLRP3 inhibitory activity, which can be further developed for the treatment of VaD in humans.",

To predict the transition from one-stage MCI to probable AD, five ensemble learning approach was used (Stacking, Gradient boost Bagging, Adaptive boost and Voting), an integrated model that combines not only cross-sectional neuroimaging biomarkers at baseline but also longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cognitive performance biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI).

        "AbstractText": "The global outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been linked to long-term neurological complications, including an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) among older adults. However, the precise genetic impact of COVID-19 on long-term AD development remains unclear. This study leveraged genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and genotype data to explore the genetic association between AD and various COVID-19 phenotypes across European ancestry (EA) and African ancestry (AA) cohorts, and the possibility of a causal effect of COVID-19 on AD. We first calculated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of three COVID-19 phenotypes in AD cases and controls from both EA and AA populations, then determined the genetic associations between COVID-19 PRSs and AD by logistic regression analyses with or without adjusting for age, sex, and APOE genotypes. Significant positive associations were found between AD diagnosis and COVID-19 PRSs in both populations, with the strongest associations identified in the AA population. However, Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses revealed no evidence of a causal effect of COVID-19 phenotypes on AD liability. We explored this finding further through the analysis of shared genomic regions between the COVID-19 phenotypes and AD and found a region of overlap on chromosome 17 that was highly pleiotropic for traits implicating immune function, psychiatric disorders, and lung function phenotypes. These findings suggest that while COVID-19 and AD share overlapping polygenic contributions involving peripheral genes across multiple traits, they lack a direct connection involving core genes that drive the development of their respective pathologies.",

        "AbstractText": "In the central nervous system, apolipoprotein (APO) E-containing high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles mediate the transport of glial-derived cholesterol to neurons, which is essential for neuronal membrane remodeling and maintenance of the myelin sheath. Despite this, the role of HDL-like cholesterol trafficking on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis remains poorly understood. We aimed to examine cholesterol transport via HDL-like particles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients compared to control individuals. Additionally, we explored the ability of reconstituted HDL containing different APOE isoforms to regulate cholesterol transport. We evaluated the capacity of CSF HDL-like particles to facilitate radiolabeled unesterified cholesterol efflux from A172 human glioblastoma astrocytes and to deliver cholesterol to SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells. The HDL-like proteome in the AD and control groups was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Reconstituted HDL nanoparticles were prepared by combining phospholipids and cholesterol with human APOE3 or APOE4, followed by radiolabeling with unesterified cholesterol. Our results showed that cholesterol efflux from astrocytes to CSF were similar between AD patients and controls, both under baseline conditions and after activation of ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1. However, CSF HDL-like particle-mediated neuronal cholesterol uptake was significantly reduced in the AD group. LC-MS/MS analysis identified 775 proteins associated with HDL-like particles in both groups, with no major alterations in proteins linked to cholesterol metabolism. However, 27 proteins involved in non-cholesterol-related processes were differentially expressed. Notably, synthetic reconstituted HDL particles containing APOE4 exhibited reduced capacity to deliver cholesterol to neurons compared to those with APOE3. These findings indicate that CSF HDL-like particles from patients with AD demonstrate impaired cholesterol delivery to neurons. Our study highlights APOE4 as a critical contributor to abnormal neuronal cholesterol uptake in AD pathophysiology.",

Here, we performed the first direct comparison of their transcriptomic landscapes. METHODS: We profiled the whole transcriptomes of NDD cortical tissue by snRNA-seq. We used computational analyses to identify common and distinct differentially expressed genes (DEGs), biological pathways, vulnerable and disease-driver cell subtypes, and alteration in cell-to-cell interactions. RESULTS: The same vulnerable inhibitory neuron subtype was depleted in both AD and DLB. Potentially disease-driving neuronal cell subtypes were present in both PD and DLB. Cell-cell communication was predicted to be increased in AD but decreased in DLB and PD. DEGs were most commonly shared across NDDs within inhibitory neuron subtypes. Overall, we observed the greatest transcriptomic divergence between AD and PD, while DLB exhibited an intermediate transcriptomic signature. DISCUSSION: These results help explain the clinicopathological spectrum of this group of NDDs and provide unique insights into the shared and distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NDDs.",

We meta-analyse vertex-wise g-cortical morphometry (volume, surface area, thickness, curvature and sulcal depth) associations using data from 3 cohorts: the UK Biobank (UKB), Generation Scotland (GenScot), and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936), with the meta-analytic N = 38,379 (age range = 44 to 84 years old). These g-morphometry associations vary in magnitude and direction across the cortex (|\u03b2| range = -0.12 to 0.17 across morphometry measures) and show good cross-cohort agreement (mean spatial correlation r = 0.57, SD = 0.18). Then, to address (2), we bring together existing - and derive new - cortical maps of 33 neurobiological characteristics from multiple modalities (including neurotransmitter receptor densities, gene expression, functional connectivity, metabolism, and cytoarchitectural similarity). We discover that these 33 profiles spatially covary along four major dimensions of cortical organisation (accounting for 65.9% of the variance) and denote aspects of neurobiological scaffolding that underpin the spatial patterning of MRI-cognitive associations we observe (significant |r| range = 0.21 to 0.56). Alongside the cortical maps from these analyses, which we make openly accessible, we provide a compendium of cortex-wide and within-region spatial correlations among general and specific facets of brain cortical organisation and higher order cognitive functioning, which we hope will serve as a framework for analysing other aspects of behaviour-brain MRI associations.",

However, most existing genetic studies have been based on short-read sequencing methods, which capture fewer than half of the SVs present in any one individual. Long-read sequencing (LRS) enhances our ability to detect disease-associated and functionally relevant structural variants (SVs); however, its application in large-scale genomic studies has been limited by challenges in sample preparation and high costs. Here, we leverage a new scalable wet-lab protocol and computational pipeline for whole-genome Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing and apply it to neurologically normal control samples from the North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC) (European ancestry) and Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) (African or African admixed ancestry) cohorts. Through this work, we present a publicly available long-read resource from 351 human brain samples (median N50: 27 Kbp and at an average depth of ~40x genome coverage). We discover approximately 234,905 SVs and produce locally phased assemblies that cover 95% of all protein-coding genes in GRCh38. Utilizing matched expression datasets for these samples, we apply quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses and identify SVs that impact gene expression in post-mortem frontal cortex brain tissue. Further, we determine haplotype-specific methylation signatures at millions of CpGs and, with this data, identify cis-acting SVs. In summary, these results highlight that large-scale LRS can identify complex regulatory mechanisms in the brain that were inaccessible using previous approaches.

ApoE is glycosylated with an O-linked Core-1 sialylated glycan at several sites, yet the impact and function of this glycosylation on AD biomarkers remains unclear. We examined apoE glycosylation in a cohort of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, n=181) and plasma (n= 178) samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) stratified into 4 groups: cognitively normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), progressors and non-progressors based on delayed word recall performance over 4 years. We observed decreasing glycosylation from apoE2 > apoE3 > apoE4 in CSF, and in plasma (apoE3 > apoE4). ApoE glycosylation was reduced in the MCI compared with CN groups, and in progressors compared to non-progressors. In CSF, higher apoE glycosylation associated cross-sectionally with lower total tau (t-tau), p-tau181, and with higher A\u03b2 1-42 . Similar associations of apoE glycosylation with higher A\u03b2 1-42 were observed in plasma. In CSF, greater apoE4 glycosylation was associated with lower t-tau and p-tau181. Over a 6-year period, higher baseline levels of CSF apoE glycosylation predicted lower rates of increase in CSF t-tau and p-tau181 and lower rates of decrease in CSF A\u03b2 1-42 .

        "AbstractText": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with one copy of APOE4 exhibit greater amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deposition compared to noncarriers, an effect that is even more pronounced in APOE4 homozygotes. Interestingly, APOE4 carriers not only show more AD pathology but also experience more rapid cognitive decline, particularly in episodic memory. The underlying mechanisms driving this domain-specific vulnerability, however, remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether the accelerated decline in episodic memory among APOE4 carriers is due to increased A\u03b2 deposition or heightened susceptibility to A\u03b2-related effects. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Initiative, we modeled amyloid duration, the estimated number of years an individual has been amyloid-positive, and its impact on cognitive trajectories. Our findings reveal that APOE4 is associated with more rapid episodic memory decline as a function of amyloid duration. This decline was dose-dependent, with APOE4 homozygotes declining more rapidly than heterozygotes, and it was consistently observed across multiple episodic memory tasks and measures. Importantly, this pattern was not observed in other cognitive domains, such as processing speed, executive function, visuospatial skills, language, or crystallized intelligence. These results suggest that cognitive trajectories in AD differ by APOE genotype, with APOE4 conferring increased vulnerability to hippocampal dysfunction early in the disease course. Future research should investigate whether these cognitive differences stem from distinct pathological cascades in APOE4 carriers.",

However, the mechanism(s) by which changes in LD composition and dynamics contribute to pathophysiology of these disorders remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a droplet associated protein with a common risk variant (E4) that confers the largest increase in genetic risk for late-onset AD. E4 is associated with both increased neuroinflammation and excess LD accumulation. In the current study, we sought to quantitatively profile the lipid and protein composition of LDs between the 'neutral' E3 and risk variant E4, to gain insight into potential LD-driven contributions to AD pathogenesis. Targeted replacement mice expressing human E3 or E4 were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 24 hours, hepatic lipid droplets were isolated for proteomic and lipidomic analyses. Lipidomics revealed a shift in the distribution of glycerophospholipids in E4 LDs with a concomitant increase in phosphatidylcholine species, and overall, the baseline profile of E4 LDs resembled that of the LPS-treated groups. Quantitative proteomics showed that LDs from E4 mice are enriched for proteins involved in protein/vesicle transport but have decreased levels of proteins involved in fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. Interestingly, proteins associated with LDs showed substantial overlap with previously published lists of AD postmortem tissue and microglia 'omics studies, suggesting a potential role for LDs in modulating AD risk or progression. Given this, we exposed primary microglia from the same E3 or E4 mice to exogenous lipid, inflammatory stimulation, necroptotic N2A cells (nN2A), or a combination of treatments to evaluate LD formation and its impact on the cells' immune state. Microglia from E4 mice accumulated more LDs in every condition tested - at baseline and following addition of fatty acids, LPS stimulation, or nN2As. E4 microglia also secreted significantly more cytokines (TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10) than E3 microglia in the control, oleic acid, and nN2A treatment conditions, yet showed a blunted response to LPS. In sum, these results suggest that E4 microglia accumulate more LDs compared to E3 microglia and that E4 is associated with a basal LD composition that resembles a pro-inflammatory cell. Together with the high overlap of the LD proteome with established AD-associated datasets, these data further support the idea that alterations in LD dynamics, particularly within microglia, may contribute to the increased risk for AD associated with APOE4 .",

Focused ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening (FUS-BBBO) noninvasively opens the BBB, allowing increased molecular transport to and from the brain parenchyma. Despite being initially developed as a drug delivery method, FUS-BBBO has shown promise both as a neuroimmunotherapeutic modality, and as a way of improving neurological disease diagnosis via amplification of disease biomarker circulation. Recently, the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in modulating the neuroimmune system and in improving biomarker detection has sparked research interest. However, despite their potential role in modulating FUS-BBBO-induced neuroimmunotherapy and their ability to improve biomarker specificity after treatment, the EV response to FUS-BBBO had not been extensively characterized prior to this study. In this study, we investigated the effect of FUS-BBBO on EV concentration and content in the serum of mice and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. We observed a 164% increase in murine EV concentration one hour after treatment, as well as an increase in EV RNA associated with FUS-BBBO neuroimmunotherapy. Patient EV concentration also increased one hour after treatment and was dependent on the volume of BBB opening three days post-treatment. Furthermore, EV isolation was found to significantly enhance the amplification of AD biomarker detection by FUS-BBBO. Overall, we present the first evidence of altered murine and AD patient EV concentration and content in response to FUS-BBBO, providing evidence of EVs' role within FUS-BBBO neuroimmunotherapy as well as their utility in improving FUS-BBBO biomarker amplification.",

Cognitive dysfunction is common in major depressive disorder (MDD), but whether bile acids impact these networks in MDD patients is unknown. METHODS: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans and blood measures of four bile acids from 74 treatment-na\u00efve adults with MDD were analyzed. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) seeds were used to examine connectivity of the ECN and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seeds were used for the DMN. Using a whole-brain analysis, the functional connectivity of these seeds was correlated with serum levels chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and its bacterially-derived secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid (LCA). RESULTS: CDCA levels were strongly and inversely correlated with connectivity between DLPFC regions of the ECN (R 2 = .401, p<.001). LCA levels were strongly and positively correlated with connectivity of the DLPFC and left inferior temporal cortex of the ECN (R 2 =.263, p<.001). The LCA/CDCA ratio was strongly and positively correlated with connectivity of the DLPFC with two components of the ECN: bilateral inferior temporal cortex and the left superior and inferior parietal lobules (all R 2 >.24, all p<.001). For the DMN, the LCA/CDCA ratio was strongly and negatively correlated with connectivity of the PCC with multiple bilateral insula regions (all R 2 >0.25, all p<.001).

We examined the medial habenulainterpeduncular nucleus (MHb-IPN), as this circuit plays crucial roles in mood regulation, has been linked to the development of diabetes after smoking, and is rich in cholinergic neurons, which are affected in other brain areas in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the impact of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemia, a type 1 diabetes model, on mitochondrial and lipid homeostasis in 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed sections from the MHb and IPN of C57BL/6 J male mice, using a recently developed automated pipeline for mitochondrial analysis in confocal images. We examined different time points after STZ-induced diabetes onset to determine how the brain responded to chronic hyperglycemia, with the limitation that mitochondria and lipids were not examined with respect to cell type or intracellular location. RESULTS: Mitochondrial distribution and morphology differentially responded to hyperglycemia depending on time and brain area. Six weeks after STZ treatment, mitochondria in the ventral MHb and dorsal IPN increased in number and exhibited altered morphology, but no changes were observed in the lateral habenula (LHb) or ventral IPN. Strikingly, mitochondrial numbers returned to normal dynamics at 12 weeks. Both blood glucose level and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) correlated with mitochondrial dynamics in ventral MHb, whereas only HbA1C correlated in the IPN. We also examined lipid homeostasis using BODIPY staining for neutral lipids in this model given that diabetes is associated with disrupted lipid homeostasis. BODIPY staining intensity was unchanged in the vMHb of STZ-treated mice but increased in the IPN and VTA and decreased in the LHb at 12 weeks. Interestingly, areas that demonstrated changes in mitochondria had little change in lipid staining and vice versa. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to describe the specific impacts of diabetes on mitochondria in the MHb-IPN circuit and suggests that the cholinergic MHb is uniquely sensitive to diabetesinduced hyperglycemia. Further studies are needed to understand the functional and behavioral implications of these findings.",

METHODS: DATA were enrolled from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and we studied healthy individuals (as controls, a total of 54), patients with mild cognitive impairment (345), and patients with Alzheimer's disease (96) A one-year follow-up was conducted to collect data on the dynamic changes of GST\u03b1 protein levels in plasma and primary information data, and to analyze the correlation between the changes in GST\u03b1 protein levels before and after the follow-up and cognitive function and its predictive value. RESULTS: Plasma GST\u03b1 protein levels were significantly lower in the AD group than in the CN group (0.94 vs1.05, p\u202f=\u202f0.04) and the MCI group (0.94 vs1.09, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Plasma GST\u03b1 protein level changes were positively correlated with altered MMSE levels in MCI and AD patients (r\u202f=\u202f0.09, p\u202f=\u202f0.04). The AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GST\u03b1 protein levels for MCI was 0.63 (0.54-0.71), p\u202f=\u202f0.02, and the AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GST\u03b1 protein levels for AD was 0.74 (0.69-0.80), p\u202f<\u202f0.001. At the same time, we plotted ROC curves for the difference in the change of plasma GST\u03b1 protein levels after 1\u202fyear of follow-up. The results showed that the AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GST\u03b1 protein levels change for MCI was 0.76 (0.696-0.83), p\u202f<\u202f0.001, and the AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GST\u03b1 protein levels change for AD was 0.75 (0.69-0.80), p\u202f<\u202f0.001. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study indicated notable differences in GST\u03b1 protein levels among patients with MCI and those with AD after a one-year follow-up period. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between changes in GST \u03b1protein levels and the decline in both baseline and cognitive function. This suggests that GST\u03b1 protein could potentially act as a biomarker for both MCI and AD, offering fresh insights for early detection and intervention strategies.",

        "AbstractText": "Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of metabolic alterations in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and highlights the significance of the peripheral metabolome, influenced by genetic factors and modifiable environmental exposures, for brain health. In this study, we examined 1,387 metabolites in plasma samples from 1,082 dementia-free middle-aged participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study. We assessed the relation of metabolites with general cognition (G-factor) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers using linear regression and estimated the variance of these metabolites explained by genes, gut microbiome, lifestyle factors, common clinical comorbidities, and medication using gradient boosting decision tree analysis. Twenty-one metabolites and one metabolite were significantly associated with total brain volume and total white matter lesions, respectively. Fourteen metabolites showed significant associations with G-factor, with ergothioneine exhibiting the largest effect (adjusted mean difference = 0.122, P = 4.65\u00d710-7). Associations for nine of the 14 metabolites were replicated in an independent, older cohort. The metabolite signature of incident AD in the replication cohort resembled that of cognition in the discovery cohort, emphasizing the potential relevance of the identified metabolites to disease pathogenesis. Lifestyle, clinical variables, and medication were most important in determining these metabolites' blood levels, with lifestyle, explaining up to 28.6% of the variance. Smoking was associated with ten metabolites linked to G-factor, while diabetes and antidiabetic medication were associated with 13 metabolites linked to MRI markers, including N-lactoyltyrosine. Antacid medication strongly affected ergothioneine levels. Mediation analysis revealed that lower ergothioneine levels may partially mediate negative effects of antacids on cognition (31.5%). Gut microbial factors were more important for the blood levels of metabolites that were more strongly associated with cognition and incident AD in the older replication cohort (beta-cryptoxanthin, imidazole propionate), suggesting they may be involved later in the disease process. The detailed results on how multiple modifiable factors affect blood levels of cognition- and brain imaging-related metabolites in dementia-free participants may help identify new AD prevention strategies.",

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated genotyping success of the NeuroBooster array (NBA) and determined the frequencies of pathogenic variants across ancestries. METHOD: We analyzed the presence and allele frequency of 34 pathogenic variants in 28,710 PD cases, 9,614 other neurodegenerative disorder cases, and 15,821 controls across 11 ancestries within the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program dataset. Of these, 25 were genotyped on NBA and cluster plots were used to assess their quality. RESULTS: Genes previously predicted to have high or very high confidence of causing PD tend to have more pathogenic variants and are present across ancestry groups. Twenty-five of the 34 pathogenic variants were typed by the NBA array and classified \"good\" (n=12), \"medium\" (n=4), and \"bad\" (n=9) variants.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: People with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit varying clinical trajectories. There is a need to predict future AD-related outcomes such as morbidity and mortality using clinical profile at the point of care. OBJECTIVE: To stratify AD patients based on baseline clinical profiles (up to two years prior to AD diagnosis) and update the model after AD diagnosis to prognosticate future AD-related outcomes. METHODS: Using the electronic health record (EHR) data of a large healthcare system (2011-2022), we first identified patients with \u22651 diagnosis code for AD or related dementia and applied a validated unsupervised phenotyping algorithm to assign AD diagnosis status. Next, we applied an unsupervised latent factor clustering approach, guided by knowledge graph embeddings of relevant EHR features up to the baseline, to cluster patients into two groups at AD diagnosis. We then prognosticated the risk of two readily ascertainable and clinically relevant AD-related outcomes ( i.e., nursing home admission indicating greater need for assistance and mortality), adjusting for baseline confounders ( e.g., age, gender, race, ethnicity, healthcare utilization, and comorbidities). For patients remaining at risk one year post-diagnosis, we updated their group membership and repeated the prognostication. RESULTS: We stratified 16,411 algorithm-identified AD patients into two groups based on their baseline clinical profiles (41% Group 1, 59% Group 2). Patients in Group 1 were marginally older at AD diagnosis (age Mean [SD]: 81.4 [9.3] vs 81.0 [8.7], p =.007), exhibited greater comorbidity burden (Elixhauser comorbidity index Mean [SD]: 11.3 [10.3] vs 7.5 [8.6], p <.0001), and more frequently received AD-related medications (47.7% vs 40.9%, p <.0001) than those in Group 2. Compared to Group 1, Group 2 had a lower risk of nursing home admission (HR [95% CI]=0.804 [0.765, 0.844], p <.001), while the two groups had similar mortality risk (HR [95% CI]=1.008 [0.963, 1.056], p =.733). One year after AD diagnosis, 12,606 patients remained at risk (45.7% Group 1, 54.3% Group 2). Consistent with baseline findings, Group 2 had a lower risk of nursing home admission than (HR [95% CI]=0.815 [0.766, 0.868], p <.001) and similar mortality risk as (HR [95% CI]=0.977 [0.922, 1.035], p =0.430) Group 1 in the updated model. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to stratify patients based on readily available clinical profiles before AD diagnosis and crucially to update the model one year after diagnosis to effectively prognosticate future AD-related outcomes. SHORT ABSTRACT: Prognostication for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the point of care could improve clinical management. Applying a novel unsupervised latent factor clustering approach guided by knowledge graph embeddings of relevant clinical features from electronic health records, we stratified 16,411 AD patients into two groups at diagnosis and prognosticated their risk of AD-related outcomes ( i.e., nursing home admission, mortality), adjusting for baseline confounders. To reflect real-world evolution in clinical trajectories, we updated patient stratification for 12,606 AD patients remaining at risk 1-year post-diagnosis and repeated prognostication. At both timepoints, one group had a higher nursing home admission risk and exhibited characteristics suggesting greater symptom burden, but the mortality risk remained comparable between groups. This study supports that patient stratification can enable outcome prognosis for AD patients. While baseline prognostication can guide early treatment and tailored management, dynamic prognostication may inform more timely interventions to improve long-term outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217 is a promising blood biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most p-tau217 assays have been validated solely in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma, leaving the clinical applicability of serum p-tau217 largely unexplored despite serum being a preferred matrix in many clinical laboratories. To address this gap, we compared p-tau217 concentrations and diagnostic performances in matched plasma and serum samples using four research-use-only assays, including three from commercial sources i.e., Lumipulse, ALZpath, NULISA, and one from University of Pittsburgh. METHODS: Paired plasma and serum samples were processed from the same venipuncture collection and assessed with the four p-tau217 assays following manufacturer-recommended procedures in two research cohorts (N=84). RESULTS: Plasma and serum p-tau217 levels varied across assays; the ALZpath, Pittsburgh, and NULISA methods showed significantly lower p-tau217 levels in serum compared with plasma (p<0.0001), while Lumipulse showed higher or non-significant differences in serum. Yet, strong correlations (rho >0.8) were observed between plasma and serum p-tau217 pairs. Both plasma and serum p-tau217 demonstrated strong classification accuracies to differentiate clinical AD from normal controls, with high AUC (up to 0.963) for all methods. The exception was the Pittsburgh assay, where plasma p-tau217 had superior AUC than serum p-tau217 (plasma: 0.912, serum: 0.844). The rest of the assays had equivalent accuracies in both matrices. CONCLUSIONS: Serum p-tau217 performs equivalently as plasma p-tau217 for most assessed assays. Serum can therefore be used in place of plasma for p-tau217 assessment for research and clinical purposes.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: The 2024 Alzheimer's Association (AA) research diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) considers fluid biomarkers, including promising blood-based biomarkers for detecting AD. This study aims to identify dementia subtypes and their cognitive and neuroimaging profiles in older adults with dementia in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) using biomarkers and clinical data. METHODS: Forty-five individuals with dementia over 65 years old were evaluated using the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia and the informant-based Alzheimer's Questionnaire. Core AD biomarkers (A\u03b242/40 and p-tau181) and non-specific neurodegeneration biomarkers (NfL, GFAP) were measured in blood plasma. Neuroimaging structures were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dementia subtypes were determined based on plasma biomarker pathology and vascular markers. Biomarker cutoff scores were identified to optimize sensitivity and specificity. Individuals were stratified into one of four dementia subtypes - AD only, non-AD vascular, non-AD other, or mixed - based on combinations of abnormalities in these markers. RESULTS: Among the 45 individuals with dementia, mixed dementia had the highest prevalence (42.4%), followed by AD-only (24.4%), non-AD other dementia (22.2%), and non-AD vascular dementia subtypes (11.1%). Both cognitive and neuroimaging profiles aligned poorly with biomarker classifications in the full sample. Cognitive tests varied across dementia subtypes. The cognitive profile of the AD-only and mixed groups suggested relatively low cognitive performance, while the non-AD and other groups had the best scores on average. CONCLUSION: Consistent with studies in other settings, our preliminary findings suggest that neurodegenerative plasma biomarkers may help to identify dementia subtypes and provide insight into cognitive and neuroimaging profiles among older adults in the DRC.",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential causal impact of OUD on later life brain health outcomes, including dementia, stroke and brain structure. METHODS: Observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted. Participants included in observational analyses were enrolled in the US Million Veteran Program (MVP). Cox proportional hazards were used to examine the association between electronic health record (EHR)-derived diagnoses of OUD and incident dementia in European and African ancestry populations. Two-sample MR was applied to explore the association between genetic predisposition to OUD and dementia, as well as key endophenotypes including brain structure. Several analyses were used for insight into aetiological pathways, including cis-MR to assess the impact of genetically-proxied opioid receptor perturbation, Bayesian colocalization, and polygenic risk score analyses of longitudinal brain changes in non-opioid users from the Lifebrain project (n=229). RESULTS: Amongst 222,518 MVP participants, 8397 developed dementia during follow up. Participants with OUD (n=9,399) were younger and more likely to be male. In observational analyses, OUD was associated with a higher risk of incident all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR]=1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.39,1.76];p=2.23\u00d710 -13 ), Alzheimer's [HR=1.40[1.04,1.87]; p=0.02) and vascular dementia (HR=1.49[1.19,1.86];p=0.0004). In the genetic analysis, genetically-proxied OUD also associated with higher dementia risk. A doubling in genetically-proxied OUD prevalence was associated with a 77% increase in odds of dementia (IVW OR=1.77[1.43,2.19];p=1.69\u00d710 \u207b\u2077 ). Variation in \u03bc-opioid receptor genes were strongly associated with dementia risk. No significant associations were observed with brain structure in non-opioid users, nor in lower powered non-European ancestry groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential causal impact of opioid use disorder on dementia. Genetic analyses supported an aetiological role of \u03bc-opioid receptor pathways. Further pharmacovigilance and investigation into the long-term effects of opioids on brain health are warranted.",

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common brain disorder among the elderly and individuals with Alzheimer's disease, where accumulation of amyloid-\u00df can lead to intracerebral hemorrhage and dementia. This review discusses recent developments in understanding the pathophysiology and phenotypes of CAA. RECENT FINDINGS: CAA has a long preclinical phase starting decades before symptoms emerge. Its pathophysiology follows consecutive stages of amyloid-\u00df deposition, decreased vascular reactivity, nonhemorrhagic changes, and ultimately hemorrhages. Although impaired perivascular clearance is the leading hypothesis underlying CAA, several lines of evidence suggest that glymphatic dysfunction also plays a significant role in the disease process. Despite its common pathway, the disease course is variable. Some patients develop more microbleeds, while others develop larger hemorrhages, suggesting a differentiation in vascular remodeling. Some patients with CAA develop a symptomatic immune response, and inflammation could be an important contributor to vascular damage in CAA in general. Furthermore, the prion-like transmission of amyloid-\u03b2 has been identified as a cause of iatrogenic CAA occurring decades after neurosurgical procedures involving cadaveric dura mater. SUMMARY: Emerging evidence of sporadic, hereditary, inflammatory, and iatrogenic CAA suggests a complex interplay between brain clearance, inflammation and vascular remodeling leading to a diverse clinical phenotype.",

        "AbstractText": "The ability to accurately quantify biological age could help monitor and control healthy aging. Epigenetic clocks have emerged as promising tools for estimating biological age, yet they have been developed from heterogeneous bulk tissues, and are thus composites of two aging processes, one reflecting the change of cell-type composition with age and another reflecting the aging of individual cell-types. There is thus a need to dissect and quantify these two components of epigenetic clocks, and to develop epigenetic clocks that can yield biological age estimates at cell-type resolution. Here we demonstrate that in blood and brain, approximately 39% and 12% of an epigenetic clock's accuracy is driven by underlying shifts in lymphocyte and neuronal subsets, respectively. Using brain and liver tissue as prototypes, we build and validate neuron and hepatocyte specific DNA methylation clocks, and demonstrate that these cell-type specific clocks yield improved estimates of chronological age in the corresponding cell and tissue-types. We find that neuron and glia specific clocks display biological age acceleration in Alzheimer's Disease with the effect being strongest for glia in the temporal lobe. Moreover, CpGs from these clocks display a small but significant overlap with the causal DamAge-clock, mapping to key genes implicated in neurodegeneration. The hepatocyte clock is found accelerated in liver under various pathological conditions. In contrast, non-cell-type specific clocks do not display biological age-acceleration, or only do so marginally. In summary, this work highlights the importance of dissecting epigenetic clocks and quantifying biological age at cell-type resolution.",

This study aimed to understand the perspectives and implications of dementia researchers communicating with policymakers and public research decision-makers (public officials). METHODS: This study uses 24 questions from an anonymous, online survey, which was received by 392 members of nine European, Latin American, and United States medical researcher associations/networks in the fields of age-related neurological degeneration and dementia medicine. The data were analyzed via crosstab analysis, two group comparison analyses, and a logistic regression model. RESULTS: In total, 91 (23.2%) respondents completed the questionnaire. Eight independent variables were related to researchers' research discipline, research remuneration, experience, authorship, H-index, and research grants. The statistically significant variables determining whether the respondents had contact with public officials were \"Years of research experience\" (p =\u202f0.004), \"Number of articles first-authored in the last 5\u202fyears\" (p =\u202f0.007), and \"Average H-index in the last 5\u202fyears\" (p =\u202f0.048) [median (IQR)]; 47% of the surveyed researchers had been in contact with public officials in the last 12\u202fmonths.

Previous studies have shown neuronal death in the brains of AD patients, but the role of cuproptosis and its associated genes in AD neurons remains unclear. METHODS: Intersection analysis was conducted using the AD transcriptome dataset GSE63060, neuron dataset GSE147528, and reported cuproptosis-related genes to identify the cuproptosis key gene FDX1 highly expressed in AD. Subsequently, cell experiments were performed by treating SH-SY5Y cells with A\u03b225-35 to establish AD cell model. The real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting (WB) assays were employed to detect the expression levels of FDX1, DLAT, and DLST. Cell proliferation was analyzed by counting Kit-8 (CCK8), mitochondrial ROS levels were analyzed using flow cytometry. shRNA was used to downregulate FDX1 expression, followed by repetition of the aforementioned experiments. Clinical experiments utilized qPCR to detect FDX1 mRNA levels in peripheral venous blood of patients, and analyzed FDX1 expression differences in different APOE genotypes of AD patients. Finally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of FDX1 was constructed based on the GeneMANIA database, immune infiltration analysis was conducted using R language, and transcription factors prediction for FDX1 was performed based on the ENCODE database. RESULTS: The cuproptosis key gene FDX1 showed significantly higher expression in peripheral blood and neuron models of AD compared to non-AD individuals, with significantly higher expression in APOE \u03b54/\u03b54 genotype than other APOE genotype of AD patients. Knockdown of FDX1 expression reduced the lipidation levels of DLAT and DLST in neurons, alleviated ROS accumulation in mitochondria, improved cell viability, and mitigated cuproptosis. Immune infiltration analysis results indicated a high enrichment of peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4-T lymphocytes in AD, and FDX1 was significantly associated with the infiltration of four immune cells and may be regulated by three transcription factors. CONCLUSION: The cuproptosis key gene FDX1 is highly expressed in AD and may promote cuproptosis in AD neurons by regulating the lipidation levels of DLAT and DLST, thereby participating in the onset and development of AD.

METHODS: This study aims to elucidate and synthesize the relationship between EVs and AD, offering critical insights to guide future research and expand therapeutic possibilities. Over the past 10-15 years, substantial progress has been made in this domain. Through bibliometric techniques, this analysis assesses research performance by examining scientific publications and metrics, including productivity indicators, impact measurements, data mining, and visualization tools. RESULTS: A total of 602 publications were analyzed using various online platforms for bibliometric analysis. Notably, the number of publications began to increase rapidly in 2018, with China and the United States emerging as leaders in this research area. The National Institute on Aging produced the highest number of publications among institutions.

Therefore, in a sample of 658 healthy middle-aged (between the ages of 40 and 65) participants of the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative cohort study, we examined the relation of blood-based tau, phosphorylated at amino acid 181 (p-tau181), reflecting neuronal p-tau secretion; neurofilament light chain (NfL), as a passively released control for p-tau181; and electroencephalography (EEG) markers of cortical excitability. A subsample of 47 participants also completed a controlled brain perturbation approach via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with concurrent EEG. Results show that both spontaneous (i.e., resting-state) and perturbation-based TMS-EEG markers, are associated with blood p-tau181, particularly in older individuals. The perturbation-based marker was a significantly more sensitive predictor of p-tau181 concentration than the spontaneous resting state EEG-based marker. The relationships observed are not present for the NfL control. These results show that relationships between p-tau181 and cortical excitability are present in healthy middle-aged subjects and that p-tau181 increases may reflect activity-dependent secretion.",

        "AbstractText": "Cell polarity is crucial in neurons, characterized by distinct axonal and dendritic structures. Neurons generally have one long axon and multiple shorter dendrites, marked by specific microtubule (MT)-associated proteins, e.g., MAP2 for dendrites and TAU for axons, while the scaffolding proteins AnkG and TRIM46 mark the axon-initial-segment. In tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), TAU sorting, and neuronal polarity are disrupted, leading to MT loss. However, modeling and studying MTs in human neuronal cells relevant to the study of AD and TAU-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) is challenging. To study MT dynamics in human neurons, we compared two cell culture systems: SH-SY5Y-derived neurons (SHN) and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (iN). Using immunostaining and EB3-tdTomato time-lapse imaging, we found AnkG absent in SHN but present in iN, while TRIM46 was present in both. TAU and MAP2 showed axonal and dendritic enrichment, respectively, similar to mouse primary neurons. Both neuron types exhibited polarized MT structures, with unidirectional MTs in axons and bidirectional MTs in dendrites. Polymerization speeds were similar; however, iNs had more retrograde MT growth events, while SHN showed a higher overall number of growth events. Thus, SHN and iN are both suitable for studying neuronal cell polarity, with SHN being particularly suitable if the focus is not the AIS.",

BACKGROUND: Obesity has been reported to be both a risk factor for PD, as well as potentially protective. The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a multigenerational longitudinal cohort study that was started in 1948, which is well-known for its cardiovascular health studies. In this study, we utilized the extensive cardiovascular and neurological data to determine if obesity contributes to the risk of the development of PD. METHODS: Participants in the FHS Original and Offspring cohorts were included in this study. Controls were selected based on sex and age at baseline examination, 1:10. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used, adjusting for age and sex. PD case status was determined utilizing prior medical and neurological examination data, Framingham Heart Study examinations, and self-report data by a panel of movement disorders neurologists using the UK Brain Bank Criteria (UKBB) and other supporting clinical details after being flagged for review by FHS neurologists. We used p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for significance. RESULTS: Accounting for missing covariate data, this study included 117 participants with PD, with 1170 controls. We found that higher BMI was associated with lower PD risk, with participants with BMI 25\u00a0kg/m2 to 30\u00a0kg/m2 having HR of 0.66 (CI 0.44-0.98; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and BMI >= 30\u00a0kg/m2 having HR 0.47 (CI 0.27-0.84; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). When the overweight and obese BMI groups were combined, we noted a more robust association, with combined HR of 0.67 (0.41-0.86; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity during mid-life potentially reduces the risk of developing PD; however, additional studies are needed to further explore this association.",

        "AbstractText": "This article presents a novel method for causal discovery with generalized structural equation models suited for analyzing diverse types of outcomes, including discrete, continuous, and mixed data. Causal discovery often faces challenges due to unmeasured confounders that hinder the identification of causal relationships. The proposed approach addresses this issue by developing two peeling algorithms (bottom-up and top-down) to ascertain causal relationships and valid instruments. This approach first reconstructs a super-graph to represent ancestral relationships between variables, using a peeling algorithm based on nodewise GLM regressions that exploit relationships between primary and instrumental variables. Then, it estimates parent-child effects from the ancestral relationships using another peeling algorithm while deconfounding a child's model with information borrowed from its parents' models. The article offers a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, establishing conditions for model identifiability and providing statistical guarantees for accurately discovering parent-child relationships via the peeling algorithms. Furthermore, the article presents numerical experiments showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in comparison to state-of-the-art structure learning methods without confounders. Lastly, it demonstrates an application to Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting the method's utility in constructing gene-to-gene and gene-to-disease regulatory networks involving Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for healthy and AD subjects.",

While HDAC6 is recognized as a promising therapeutic target for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, its involvement in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) remains underexplored. Currently, there are no direct methods available for characterizing HDAC6 in the brains of living subjects. Positron emission tomography (PET) techniques offer a noninvasive approach to visualize HDAC6, potentially enhancing our understanding of its neuropathological roles. In this study, we present the synthesis and PET imaging of [18F]3, an 18F-labeled 5-aroylindole derivative, which exhibits favorable affinity for HDAC6. The synthesis of [18F]3 was achieved through microwave-assisted radiofluorination of a nitro-precursor, followed by hydroxamic acid formation. PET studies using [18F]3 in SCA17 transgenic mice revealed significantly increased radioactivity in the brain compared to wild-type mice, particularly evident in the cerebellum and hippocampus.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Hederagenin (HG), derived from ivy seeds, is known to offer protection against Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific molecular pathways through which it counters ferroptosis-induced neurotoxicity are not fully elucidated. This investigation seeks to delineate the processes by which HG mitigates neurotoxic effects in HT22 cells subjected to glutamate (Glu)-induced ferroptosis. METHODS: HT22 cell ferroptosis was prompted by Glu exposure. Cell viability was assessed using CCK-8 and LDH assays, while Fe2+ fluorescence and assays of iron-related proteins served to gauge intracellular Fe2+ concentrations. Evaluations of mitochondrial structure and functionality employed JC-1 staining and transmission electron microscopy. Assessments of ROS, lipid peroxidation, MDA, 4-HNE, and the GSSG/GSH ratio were conducted to ascertain HG's antioxidative efficacy. The expression of proteins within the PPAR\u03b1/Nrf2/GPX4 pathway was quantified via western blotting, with molecular docking (MD), and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) used to explore protein interactions. RESULTS: HG diminished the cellular toxicity triggered by Glu in HT22 cells, lowered Fe2+ within cells, and rejuvenated mitochondrial morphology and performance. Concurrently, it modulated proteins critical to Fe2+ metabolism, diminished ROS and lipid peroxidation, and elevated GSH/GSSG ratios. Enhanced PPAR\u03b1/Nrf2/GPX4 protein levels were corroborated by western blot results. Furthermore, molecular docking revealed favorable binding of HG to the proteins PPAR\u03b1, Nrf2, and GPX4, with binding energies of -7.751, -7.535, and -7.414\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively. MDS confirmed robust interactions between HG and these pivotal targets. CONCLUSION: The evidence suggests that HG effectively mitigates Glu-induced ferroptosis in HT22 cells by activating the PPAR\u03b1/Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway. These findings endorse HG's potential as a nutritional adjunct for AD management.",

We sought to determine (1) if in vivo FLT1 levels (CSF and plasma) associate with biomarkers of AD neuropathology or differ between diagnostic staging in an aged cohort enriched for early disease, and (2) whether FLT1 expression interacts with amyloid on downstream outcomes, such as phosphorylated tau levels and cognitive performance. Additionally, we sought to replicate FLT1 interactions in the brain. The results showed that higher levels of FLT1 in CSF and post-mortem brain tissue related to increased tau, particularly among amyloid positive individuals.

METHODS: We used data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) in 2018(N = 8498). Cognitive function was measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Logistic and linear regression were applied to assess the associations of tea consumption with cognitive impairment and cognitive scores, respectively. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to balance characteristic differences between groups. RESULTS: The characteristics of tea consumption status, frequency and type were well balanced between groups after using PSM and IPTW. Drinking tea was associated with less cognitive impairment (ORadjusted:0.84, ORPSM:0.84, ORIPTW:0.87) and higher cognitive scores (Coefficientadjusted:0.29, CoefficientPSM:0.33, CoefficientIPTW:0.29).

The datasets GSE36980 and GSE48350 were downloaded from the GEO database and visualized using R packages to obtain DEGs. Subsequently, the potential biological functions of these DEGs were predicted, PPI network interactions were screened for core genes, and Pearson correlation analysis was performed. Additionally, we determined the diagnostic value of core DEGs using ROC curves. Single-cell analysis was used to verify the cell type specificity of hub genes. Finally, we used RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence to validate the expression of core DEGs in model mice and to explore the beneficial mechanisms of exercise. A total of 13 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the development of AD were identified, comprising 11 down-regulated genes and 2 up-regulated genes. PPI network visualization acquired four down-regulated core DEGs with good diagnostic value. The findings from the in vivo study indicated that the mRNA expression of GABRA1, GABRG2, and SVOP decreased, and the astrocyte marker GFAP notably increased in AD mice.

Two medical databases were searched: Web of Science and PubMed in the period from 2009-2023, where a total of 37 publications that met the inclusion criteria were selected for further evaluation. Both patients with AD and with PD showed statistically significantly higher levels of interleukin IL-6 compared to the control group: p-value of 0.0034 for AD (SMD, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.39-1.96) and p-value of 0.0487 for PD (SMD 0.29 95% Cl 0.00-0.59). In AD patients, statistical significance (for random effect) was also observed for IL-1\u03b2, where higher values of this cytokine were recorded in patients compared to controls (p-value <0.001).

        "AbstractText": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death driven by oxidative stress, plays a crucial role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aging diminishes antioxidant systems that maintain iron homeostasis, particularly affecting the glutathione peroxidase (GPX) system, leading to increased ferroptosis and exacerbated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in AD. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor regulating genes involved in antioxidant defense and ferroptosis. In this review, we examine the interconnected roles of Nrf2 signaling, iron metabolism, and ferroptosis in AD, and discuss how regular physical exercise-known to enhance antioxidant capacity-might influence these processes. Despite evidence linking exercise to improved cognitive function in AD and its role in modulating oxidative stress, there is a paucity of research specifically addressing how exercise affects ferroptosis in the AD brain. To address this gap, we utilized bioinformatics techniques to identify potential pathways and mechanisms by which exercise may mitigate ferroptosis in AD through Nrf2 signaling. Analyzing gene expression profiles from the GEO database, we identified differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes in the hippocampus following exercise intervention. Hub genes like SLC2A1, TXN, MEF2C, and KRAS were significantly upregulated, suggesting that exercise may activate a network enhancing antioxidant defenses and regulating iron metabolism via Nrf2. Our findings propose a novel mechanism whereby exercise alleviates abnormal ferroptosis in the AD brain through modulation of Nrf2 signaling. This study highlights the need for further research to validate these findings and explore exercise as a therapeutic strategy for AD by targeting ferroptosis.",

This review explores the multifaceted interactions between these proteins and their contribution to the pathological landscape of AD, encompassing synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and PANoptosis. PANoptosis is a collective term for programmed cell death (PCD) modalities that encompass elements of apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. The accumulation of A\u03b2 peptides and tau proteins, along with the immune response in brain cells, may trigger PANoptosis, thus advancing the progression of the disease. Recent advancements in molecular imaging and genetics have provided deeper insights into the interactions between A\u03b2 peptides, tau proteins, and the immune response. The review also discusses the role of mitochondrial dysregulation in AD. The exploration of the interplay between neurodegeneration, immune responses, and cell death offers promising avenues for the development of innovative treatments.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with an insidious onset, primarily characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function. MCP-1 is a cytokine with chemotactic effects on monocytes, which can regulate their migration and infiltration and participate in disease progression. Increasing evidence suggests that MCP-1 plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease and has the potential to act as an early diagnostic marker and intervention target. This paper reviews the regulatory role of MCP-1 in neuroinflammation, beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition and Tau pathology, and explores the potential of MCP-1 as a biomarker and intervention target for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "ArticleTitle": "GASTRODIN PROTECTS AGAINST SEPSIS-ASSOCIATED ENCEPHALOPATHY BY SUPPRESSING FERROPTOSIS.",
        "AbstractText": "Background: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) represents a severe complication of sepsis, substantially elevating both mortality and healthcare costs for patients. Gastrodin (GAS), a principal bioactive constituent of Gastrodia elata Blume, is neuroprotective in various neurological disorders, including ischemic stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and neuropathic pain. In this study, we sought to investigate whether GAS could serve as a protective agent against SAE. Methods: Mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or the murine brain microvascular endothelial cell bEnd.3 was exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequently treated with GAS. We assessed neurological deficits, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, neuroinflammation, and the state of ferroptosis to evaluate the regulation of GAS on SAE. Mechanistically, we utilized glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) knockout mice to delineate the crucial role of GPX4 and examined the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway to uncover the upstream signaling of GPX4. Results: GAS mitigated neurological deficits in SAE mice and reduced BBB disruption and neuroinflammation both in vivo and in vitro . Functionally, the neuroprotective effects of GAS were realized through the inhibition of ferroptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GPX4 played a pivotal role in this process. Lastly, we found that the COX-2/PGE2 pathway was activated following GAS treatment in SAE mice, thereby increasing the expression level of GPX4. Conclusions: Our study elucidated that GAS offers protection against SAE by suppressing ferroptosis through the activation of the COX-2/PGE2/GPX4 axis. This research validates the therapeutic potential of GAS and provides novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies for the management of SAE.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Cardiorespiratory fitness, hippocampal subfield morphology, and episodic memory in older adults.",
        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Age-related hippocampal atrophy is associated with memory loss in older adults, and certain hippocampal subfields are more vulnerable to age-related atrophy than others. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may be an important protective factor for preserving hippocampal volume, but little is known about how CRF relates to the volume of specific hippocampal subfields, and whether associations between CRF and hippocampal subfield volumes are related to episodic memory performance. To address these gaps, the current study evaluates the associations among baseline CRF, hippocampal subfield volumes, and episodic memory performance in cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition Trial of Exercise (IGNITE) (NCT02875301). METHODS: Participants (N\u202f=\u202f601, ages 65-80, 72% female) completed assessments including a graded exercise test measuring peak oxygen comsumption (VO2peak) to assess CRF, cognitive testing, and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the hippocampus processed with Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS). Separate linear regression models examined whether CRF was associated with hippocampal subfield volumes and whether those assocations were moderated by age or sex. Mediation models examined whether hippocampal volumes statistically mediated the relationship between CRF and episodic memory performance. Covariates included age, sex, years of education, body mass index, estimated intracranial volume, and study site. RESULTS: Higher CRF was significantly associated with greater total left (B\u202f=\u202f5.82, p\u202f=\u202f0.039) and total right (B\u202f=\u202f7.64, p\u202f=\u202f0.006) hippocampal volume, as well as greater left CA2 (B\u202f=\u202f0.14, p\u202f=\u202f0.022) and dentate gyrus (DG; B\u202f=\u202f2.34, p\u202f=\u202f0.031) volume, and greater right CA1 (B\u202f=\u202f3.99, p\u202f=\u202f0.011), CA2 (B\u202f=\u202f0.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.002), and subiculum (B\u202f=\u202f1.56, p\u202f=\u202f0.004) volume. Sex significantly moderated left DG volume (B\u202f=\u202f-4.26, p\u202f=\u202f0.017), such that the association was positive and significant only for males. Total left hippocampal volume [indirect effect\u202f=\u202f0.002, 95% CI (0.0002, 0.00), p\u202f=\u202f0.027] and right subiculum volume [indirect effect\u202f=\u202f0.002, 95% CI (0.0007, 0.01), p\u202f=\u202f0.006] statistically mediated the relationship between CRF and episodic memory performance. DISCUSSION: While higher CRF was significantly associated with greater total hippocampal volume, CRF was not associated with all underlying subfield volumes. Our results further demonstrate the relevance of the associations between CRF and hippocampal volume for episodic memory performance. Finally, our results suggest that the regionally-specific effects of aging and Alzheimer's disease on hippocampal subfields could be mitigated by maintaining higher CRF in older adulthood.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a major negative impact on people's quality of life, life, and health. More research is needed to determine the relationship between age and the pathologic products associated with AD. Meanwhile, the construction of an early diagnostic model of AD, which is mainly characterized by pathological products, is very important for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. METHOD: We collected clinical study data from September 2005 to August 2024 from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Using correlation analysis method like cor function, we analyzed the pathology products (t-Tau, p-Tau, and A\u03b2 proteins), age, gender, and Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the ADNI data. Next, we investigated the relationship between pathologic products and age in the AD and non-AD groups using linear regression. Ultimately, we used these features to build a diagnostic model for AD. RESULTS: A total of 1,255 individuals were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 73.27 [7.26] years; 691male [55.1%]; 564 female [44.9%]). The results of the correlation analysis showed that the correlations between pathologic products and age were, in descending order, Tau (Corr=0.75), p-Tau (Corr=0.71), and A\u03b2 (Corr=0.54). In the AD group, t-Tau protein showed a tendency to decrease with age, but it was not statistically significant. p-Tau protein levels similarly decreased with age and its decrease was statistically significant. In contrast to Tau protein, in the AD group, A\u03b2 levels increased progressively with age. In the non-AD group, the trend of pathologic product levels with age was consistently opposite to that of the AD group. We finally screened the optimal AD diagnostic model (AUC=0.959) based on the results of correlation analysis and by using the Xgboost algorithm and SVM algorithm. CONCLUSION: In a novel finding, we observed that Tau protein and A\u03b2 had opposite trends with age in both the AD and non-AD groups. The linear regression curves of the AD and non-AD groups had completely opposite trends. Through a machine learning approach, we constructed an AD diagnostic model with excellent performance based on the selected features.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Progressive iron overload in middle-aged mice impairs olfactory function, triggers lipid oxidation and induces apoptosis.",
        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: This study aims to investigate the progressive impact of chronic iron overload on the olfactory bulb, a region significantly affected in early neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The focus is on understanding how iron accumulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal damage over time in middle-aged mice. METHOD: The mice were continuously administered FC for a duration of 16\u00a0weeks, and the olfactory behavior of the mice was observed at intervals of 4\u00a0weeks. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was employed to detect alterations in iron content within the olfactory bulb of the mice, while levels of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant indexes were assessed using biochemical kits. Additionally, western blotting and qPCR techniques were utilized to analyze transcriptional and expression changes in proteins and genes related to iron metabolism. Furthermore, microstructural modifications as well as mitochondrial observations were conducted through paraffin sectioning and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULT: A significant and progressive increase in iron accumulation in the olfactory bulb, starting from week 8 and peaking at week 16. This accumulation coincided with a decline in olfactory function observed at week 12. Key markers of oxidative stress, such as 4-HNE and MDA, were elevated in specific layers, and antioxidant defenses were reduced. Mitochondrial damage became evident from week 8, with caspase-3 activation indicating increased apoptosis, particularly in the granular layer. This study is to demonstrate the link between chronic iron overload and progressive olfactory dysfunction in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. It provides evidence that iron-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in the olfactory bulb contribute to early sensory deficits, suggesting that the olfactory bulb's selective vulnerability can serve as an early biomarker for neurodegenerative conditions. CONCLUSION: Chronic iron overload leads to progressive oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in the olfactory bulb, causing sensory deficits. Targeting iron accumulation and oxidative damage may offer new strategies for early intervention in neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the importance of addressing iron dysregulation.",

        "AbstractText": "Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia is crucial for enabling timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers (neurofilament light chain and phosphorylated tau181) and retinal biomarkers (retinal nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer), individually and in combination, in differentiating moderate cognitive impairment and dementia from mild cognitive impairment and no cognitive impairment. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 509 participants, aged 50 and older, recruited from a memory clinic. The participants were categorized as normal (n = 100), mild cognitive impairment (n = 144), moderate cognitive impairment (n = 90) or dementia (n = 175) based on detailed clinical assessments, neuropsychological testing and MRI scans. The thickness of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (P < 0.001) and retinal nerve fibre layer (P = 0.030) decreased progressively from normal cognition to cognitive impairment and dementia. The thickest layers were observed in individuals with no cognitive impairment (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer: 76 \u00b1 11\u2005\u00b5m, retinal nerve fibre layer: 92 \u00b1 10\u2005\u00b5m), while the thinnest layers were found in individuals with dementia (ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer: 72 \u00b1 14\u2005\u00b5m, retinal nerve fibre layer: 89 \u00b1 12\u2005\u00b5m). Plasma biomarker levels increased progressively from normal cognition to cognitive impairment and dementia (P < 0.001). Levels were lowest in individuals with no cognitive impairment [median (interquartile range): neurofilament light chain: 15 (9) pg/mL, phosphorylated tau181: 1.85 (1.00) pg/mL] and highest in those with dementia [neurofilament light chain: 34 (27) pg/mL, phosphorylated tau181: 3.24 (2.81) pg/mL]. After adjusting for retinal scan signal strength, neurofilament light chain showed a stronger negative association with retinal nerve fibre layer thickness [standardized beta estimate (\u03b2) = -0.184] and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness (\u03b2 = -0.139) compared to phosphorylated tau181, which exhibited weaker associations with ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (\u03b2 = -0.091) and retinal nerve fibre layer (\u03b2 = -0.059). While retinal parameters provided modest discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.60), plasma biomarkers demonstrated superior diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.76). Notably, neurofilament light chain had a stronger association with retinal thinning than phosphorylated tau181 and offered superior diagnostic value for identifying moderate cognitive decline. These findings underscore the potential of plasma biomarkers, particularly neurofilament light chain, for the early detection of dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "Extracellular beta-amyloid aggregation and inflammation are in a complex and not fully understood interplay during hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Our group has previously shown that an immune challenge with tumour necrosis factor alpha can alter extracellular beta-sheet containing aggregates in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons carrying familial Alzheimer's disease-related presenilin 1 mutations. Here, using single-molecule detection and super-resolution imaging techniques, we quantified and characterized the intra- and extracellular beta-amyloid and AT8-positive tau aggregates. Our results indicate a pre-existing Alzheimer's disease-like pathology caused by the presenilin 1 mutation, with increased beta-amyloid aggregates in both the cell lysate and conditioned media compared to isogenic controls and also increased intracellular tau aggregates. The main effect of tumour necrosis factor alpha treatment on presenilin 1 neurons was the formation of larger intracellular beta-amyloid aggregates. In contrast, isogenic controls showed more significant changes with tumour necrosis factor alpha treatment with an increase in beta-amyloid aggregates in the media but not intracellularly and an increase in tau aggregates in both the media and cell lysate, suggesting a chronic inflammation-driven mechanism for the development of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Remarkably, we also found significant morphological differences between intra- and extracellular beta-amyloid and tau aggregates in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons, suggesting these neurons can only clear aggregates when small, and that larger aggregates stay inside the neurons. While majority of the beta-amyloid aggregates were cleared into the media, a greater portion of the tau aggregates remained intracellular. This size-dependent aggregate clearance was also shown to be conserved in vivo, using soaked and homogenized mouse and human post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brain samples. As such, our results are proposing a previously unknown, size-dependent aggregate clearance mechanism, which can possibly explain the intracellular aggregation of tau and extracellular aggregation of beta-amyloid.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) are preferred alternatives to using antipsychotic medications to manage disruptive behaviors in nursing home (NH) residents living with dementia. However, the implementation of these interventions is often complex in the NH environment. In this qualitative analysis of data from an embedded pragmatic clinical trial (ePCT) of a personalized music intervention, we describe NH-level implementation barriers and facilitators. METHODS: In a 54-facility trial, we randomized 27 NHs from four US corporations to the personalized music intervention. In this qualitative analysis, we analyzed barriers and facilitators at 9 of the 27 intervention NHs, using (1) routinely collected data collector observations and (2) semi-structured interviews with NH staff. We iteratively developed codes to best describe these data and generated themes. RESULTS: We found five qualitative themes related to the variation of intervention implementation across NHs: (1) turnover and institutional changes interfered with implementation; (2) consistent with pragmatic implementation, delivery strategies varied across NHs; (3) family members influenced residents' participation; (4) non-clinical program champions needed clinical buy-in, which was challenging and required demonstrating the intervention's clinical benefits; and (5) technological barriers among staff and residents impeded implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative results from nine facilities participating in a NH ePCT of personalized music intervention highlight the importance of identifying an intervention's key components to ensure fidelity, while allowing the flexibility necessary for pragmatic implementation. Engaging family caregivers may improve the implementation of NPIs in the NH setting. Results may be helpful to other researchers implementing NPIs to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms for people living with dementia in NHs.

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, often showing neuropathological indicators by age 40. Physical function and activities of daily living (ADLs) are understudied areas of function that may inform dementia risk. We investigated associations among age, physical function (gait/balance, grip strength, and lower extremity strength), ADLs, and dementia risk symptoms in adults with DS. We hypothesized that compromised physical function and lower independence with ADLs would be associated with an informant/caregiver-reported measure of dementia risk symptoms. METHODS: A secondary analysis for this cross-sectional study was completed using data from two academic research centers with 43 adults with DS (age 30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012 years). We examined the association of dementia risk symptoms, captured through the Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID), with physical function (timed up and go [TUG], sit-to-stand [STS], grip strength) and ADLs (Waisman Activities of Daily Living Scale). A linear regression model for the continuous dementia risk measure in the DSQIID used a log transformation of (1\u00a0+\u00a0log(Y\u00a0+\u00a01)) to account for a high zero count. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess differences in the physical function measures, DSQIID questionnaire, and Waisman ADL by dividing mean age categories. RESULTS: Higher DSQIID scores were associated with lower independence with ADLs (\u03b2 = -0.103, p = 0.008), slower gait times (TUG; \u03b2 = 0.112, p = 0.034), and impaired lower extremity strength (STS; \u03b2 = 0.112, p = 0.017) and grip strength (\u03b2 = -0.039, p = 0.034). DSQIID scores\u00a0differed significantly between the \u226530 and <30 age groups. Participants \u226530 years of age scored 5 points higher on the DSQIID than participants <30, suggesting that age was associated with greater dementia risk. DISCUSSION: Greater dementia risk symptoms were associated with age, lower physical function scores, and independence with ADLs, suggesting that declines in physical function and ADLs may be early indicators of subsequent dementia risk in adults with DS. HIGHLIGHTS: We explored the association of physical function and activities of daily living (ADLs) in aging adults with DS and their relationship with informant/caregiver report of dementia risk symptoms.Our findings demonstrated a significant relationship between a higher number of dementia risk symptoms observed and lower independence with ADLs, and impaired gait/balance, grip strength, and lower extremity strength.Further research with larger longitudinal studies is necessary to investigate any causative relationships among physical function, ADL function, and dementia risk symptoms.",

We hypothesized that mid-trial informant replacement impacts study data in industry-sponsored trials. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of two industry-sponsored AD clinical trials testing semagacestat in mild-to-moderate AD dementia. We assessed the relationships between informant replacement and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scores. Using generalized estimating equations, we assessed bias and variability using mean (bias) and mean absolute (variance) change in ADCS-ADL between successive visits as outcomes. Both models adjusted for a priori-specified potential confounding variables including participant sex, age, informant type, trial, time, previous ADCS-ADL score, and region. To analyze the\u00a0impact on end-of-study change-from-baseline results, we used an analysis of covariance model to estimate the association between replacement and end-of-study change-from-baseline in ADCS-ADL, in which we adjusted for participant sex, age, informant type, trial, baseline measurement, and region. We conducted an F-test to compare the variances of this change. RESULTS: Among N\u00a0=\u00a02637 randomized participants, 69 participants (2.6%) experienced 78 occurrences of replacement. For visits standardized to be 3 months apart, the difference in mean between-visit change in ADCS-ADL was approximately\u00a0-1.61 points (95% confidence interval [CI]:\u00a0-3.79, 0.57; P\u00a0=\u00a00.147), comparing participants who experienced replacement to similar participants who had stable informants.

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The aggregation and spread of hyperphosphorylated, pathological tau in the human brain is hypothesized to play a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as other neurogenerative tauopathies. O-GlcNAcylation, an important post-translational modification of tau and many other proteins, is significantly decreased in brain tissue of AD patients relative to healthy controls. Increased tau O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to reduce tau pathology in mouse in vivo tauopathy models. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc from tau thereby driving interest in OGA inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach to reduce tau pathology and slow the progression of AD. METHODS: A multidisciplinary approach was used to identify ceperognastat (LY3372689) as a potent OGA inhibitor, including an extensive discovery effort with synthetic chemistry, structure-based drug design, and in vivo OGA enzyme occupancy studies. Preclinical studies assessed the target engagement, inhibition of OGA enzyme activity, OGA enzyme occupancy, and changes in tau O-GlcNAc. Four clinical Phase 1 studies of ceperognastat in healthy participants were performed to assess clinical safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and enzyme occupancy. RESULTS: Ceperognastat is a potent, central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant, low-dose inhibitor of OGA, which can achieve >\u00a095% OGA enzyme occupancy in animal and human brain. Overall, ceperognastat had an acceptable safety profile in Phase 1 clinical studies with no serious adverse events reported following single and multiple dosing. The PK, enzyme occupancy, and safety profile supported Phase 2 development of ceperognastat. DISCUSSION: Ceperognastat is an orally available, highly potent, CNS-penetrant OGA inhibitor that achieved high (>\u00a080%) OGA enzyme occupancy and increased brain O-GlcNAc-tau preclinically. Ceperognastat demonstrated >\u00a095% OGA enzyme occupancy in Phase 1 trials. These occupancy data informed the dose selection for the Phase 2 clinical program. HIGHLIGHTS: Ceperognastat is a highly potent, CNS-penetrant OGA inhibitor.Ceperognastat is both orally available and CNS-penetrant even when given at low doses.Ceperognastat can achieve >\u00a095% OGA enzyme occupancy in the animal and human brain.Ceperognastat had an acceptable safety profile in Phase 1 clinical studies.",

The work is highly stressful, so improving responses to stress in this workforce could contribute to satisfaction and retention. This research developed a coping measure appropriate for the diverse professional caregiver workforce. METHODS: A multistage process identified and refined existing and new items. Ten racially and ethnically diverse professional caregivers advised on item selection and refinement. Subsequently, using an online QR code-accessed questionnaire, data were collected from 391 professional caregivers from 10 NHs and 3 AL communities in three states, yielding a sample that was 87% female, widely distributed in age and experience, and racially/ethnically diverse (42% Black, non-Hispanic/Latinx; 25% White, non-Hispanic/Latinx; 20% Hispanic/Latinx; 7% Asian, non-Hispanic/Latinx; and 21% born outside the United States). Analyses examined psychometric properties and principal components analysis identified factors within which items and scales aggregated. RESULTS: The final instrument, named the Long-Term Care Cope (LTC Cope), includes 26 items aggregated into six factors, which explained 60% of the variance: avoidance (five items, loadings 0.58-0.76); adaptive psychological strategies (six items, loadings 0.33-0.89); active engagement (five items, 0.47-0.89); maladaptive psychological strategies (three items, loadings 0.90-0.93); actions to minimize emotional impact (four items, loadings 0.28-0.74); and substance use (three items, loadings 0.61-0.88). Respondents often reported using multiple items within multiple factors when responding to stressful situations at work. DISCUSSION: The coping strategies of professional caregivers are highly individual, with caregivers tending to utilize multiple strategies. The LTC Cope instrument and its component subscales are promising for future research to improve understanding of stress-related coping in this diverse workforce and inform and evaluate interventions. HIGHLIGHTS: A new measure was developed to help us better understand how professional caregivers (nursing assistants and personal care aides) deal with work-related stress.Professional caregivers in nursing homes and assisted living tend to use multiple approaches to deal with job stress.Ways professional caregivers cope with stress vary widely-some address problems directly, some try to deal with the emotional toll of the work, and others involve avoiding the problems or their emotional consequences.",

Associations of plasma biomarkers with clinical conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia were evaluated using Kaplan\u2012Meier curves. RESULTS: The participants included 107 patients (57 [53.3%] females, median age: 76.0 [72.0-80.0] years). Plasma biomarkers correlated with cortical amyloid uptake (\u03c1 = 0.667-0.754). The composite biomarker had the best area under the curve (0.943, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.901 to 0.985) for predicting amyloid positivity. Apolipoprotein \u03b54 status showed significant correlations with increased plasma amyloid biomarker levels. Participants with high composite biomarker levels at baseline had a greater risk of conversion to AD dementia (hazard ratio 10.74, 95% CI: 3.51 to 32.84, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The higher composite biomarker was associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline (\u03c1 = -0.575, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). DISCUSSION: Plasma A\u03b2 composite biomarker may serve as a surrogate measure for amyloid deposition and a predictor of disease progression in a community-based cohort. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma amyloid beta (A\u03b2) biomarkers correlated with 11C-Pittsburgh compound B uptake, mainly in the frontal/parietotemporal cortices and posterior cingulate gyrus.The amyloid composite biomarker can predict amyloid positron emission tomography positivity with a high area under the curve of 0.943 in a community-based mild cognitive impairment cohort.The higher amyloid composite biomarker at baseline was significantly associated with worsening Mini-Mental State Examination score and a high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia over 8 years.The amyloid composite biomarker can predict clinical progression to AD dementia with a high area under the curve of 0.860.Apolipoprotein E \u03b54 status influenced the plasma A\u03b2 biomarker levels.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Emerging Alzheimer's disease treatment paradigms: A late-stage clinical trial review.",
        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Without disease-modifying interventions, Medicare and Medicaid spending on Alzheimer's disease (AD) management is expected to reach 637 billion USD annually by 2050. The recent advent of promising AD therapies after decades of a near-total failure rate in clinical trials suggests that more disease-modifying therapies are on the horizon. In this review, we assess the late-stage pipeline of disease-modifying candidates for AD and offer a novel classification of intervention candidates by treatment paradigms-groups of candidates that share an underlying biological mechanism of action and general disease target. METHODS: We extracted data from the National Library of Medicine clinical trials database regarding Phase 2 and 3 trials of disease-modifying AD therapies. We categorized trials into eight unique treatment paradigms, which we defined by combinations of therapy (biologic, small molecule, cell and gene therapy, other) and target (amyloid, tau, other). We analyzed primary endpoints, eligibility criteria including clinical ratings of cognition, trial phase and length, and funding sources. RESULTS: We identified 123 unique disease-modifying intervention candidates in 175 late-stage clinical trials. Biologic and small molecule drugs comprised 30% and 54% of trials, respectively. Eligibility criteria favored patients between the ages of 60 and 80 years with mild cognitive impairment. Including multi-phase trials, 81% of studies were engaged in Phase 2 and 27% in Phase 3. Notably, within the Biologic-Amyloid paradigm, 64% of trials were engaged in Phase 3. DISCUSSION: Current studies of disease-modifying therapies for AD comprise a diverse set of approaches to treating the disease. However, effort is largely concentrated in a few treatment paradigms and a narrow patient population, causing varying rates of progress among treatment paradigms in the late-stage clinical trial pipeline. Strategies may be warranted to accelerate successes in the most promising therapeutical paradigms and nurture growth within nascent areas lacking resources but not potential. HIGHLIGHTS: An analysis of Alzheimer's disease trial treatment paradigms was conducted.From April 2021 to March 2023, 175 trials of 123 unique candidates were reviewed.Biologic and small molecule drugs comprised 30% and 54% of trials, respectively.Eligibility criteria favored ages 60 through 80 with mild cognitive impairment.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Measurements of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are important for capturing disease impact beyond physical health and relative to other diseases but have rarely been assessed in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). METHODS: HRQoL was characterized overall, by sex and subtype in PPA (n\u00a0=\u00a0118) using the Health Utilities Index-2/3 (HUI2/3). Multiple linear regression assessed associations between HRQoL and language severity. RESULTS: Multi-attribute HUI2/3 summary scores indicated moderate to severe impairment. Scores did not differ by sex and were more severe for semantic than non-semantic PPA. Language severity scores showed significant associations with HUI multi-attribute scores and select single-attribute measures (hearing, sensation, cognition, and speech) with less language impairment associated with better functional capacity related to HRQoL. DISCUSSION: This study identified poor HRQoL in a relatively large PPA cohort. HRQoL measures aid in determining patient perspective, policy decision making, and resource allocation. Results may be used to advocate for PPA support.

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Professional caregivers (nursing assistants and personal care aides) in nursing homes (NH) and assisted living (AL) provide the majority of long-term residential care for persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Their work is stressful, but until recently, no measures were available to assess stress in this workforce. Using the new Long-Term Care Cope (LTC COPE) scale, this study evaluates the relationship of coping with staff demographic characteristics and outcomes; the findings can be used to develop and evaluate interventions to improve staff well-being. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional online questionnaire completed by professional caregivers working in a purposive selection of 10 NHs and three AL communities in California, New York, and North Carolina. The sample included 391 professional caregivers and had a representative distribution by age; it was 87% female; 42% non-Hispanic/Latinx (NHL) Black, 25% NHL White, 20% Hispanic/Latinx, and 7% NHL Asian. Worker job satisfaction, mental health, and health-related quality of life were examined in relation to caregiver demographics and the following approaches to coping as measured by the LTC COPE: avoidance, adaptive psychological strategies, active engagement, maladaptive psychological strategies, minimizing emotional impact, and substance use. Statistical comparisons used non-parametric Spearman correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Little difference in coping strategies was noted by sex and education; older caregivers used adaptive psychological strategies more than younger caregivers; and traditionally minoritized adults (NHL Black, NHL Asian, and Hispanic/Latinx), compared to NHL White adults, more often used adaptive and less often used maladaptive psychological coping strategies. The use of maladaptive and avoidance strategies was strongly associated with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout. DISCUSSION: Professional caregivers report using a wide variety of coping strategies, with multiple strategies being the norm, and both adaptive/engaged and maladaptive/disengaged approaches are common. Certain coping approaches are strongly linked to depression, anxiety, and burnout; attention to training and support of adaptive and positive coping may augment other efforts to improve job satisfaction and performance. The LTC COPE scale has the potential to guide and evaluate practices to improve workers' well-being. HIGHLIGHTS: Professional caregivers in nursing homes and assisted living generally use multiple strategies to cope with work-related stress.Certain coping approaches are strongly linked to depression, anxiety, and burnout.The Long-Term Care Cope scale has potential to guide and evaluate practices to improve worker well-being.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Trends and determinants of choline alfoscerate use in newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients in Korea.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Choline alfoscerate, a cholinergic precursor, is widely used in Korea for dementia-related symptoms and is covered by national health insurance (NHI). This study investigates the utilization trends and factors influencing choline alfoscerate prescription in newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients using real-world data. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) for patients aged 60 years and older who were newly diagnosed with AD between 2012 and 2019. Patients with prescriptions for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) or memantine within 60 days of diagnosis were included. Choline alfoscerate utilization was defined as prescriptions within 60 days of initial diagnosis. Factors influencing its use were identified through multiple logistic regression analyses, and trends over time were assessed using the Cochran-Armitage Trend test. RESULTS: Among the 330,326 study participants, 99,845 (33.08%) were prescribed choline alfoscerate, with usage increasing from 15.96% in 2012 to 47.65% in 2019. Factors positively associated with its use included male sex, MedAid insurance, and osteoarthritis. Conversely, usage decreased with comorbidities such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, stroke/transient ischemic attack, chronic kidney disease, and depression. CONCLUSION: Choline alfoscerate usage in Korea has significantly increased, partly due to its national insurance coverage and the absence of disease-modifying therapies for AD. Given the uncertain efficacy and potential risks of choline alfoscerate, continuous monitoring and rigorous evaluation of its long-term benefits and safety are essential. Further research is necessary to establish definitive evidence for its effectiveness and guide its therapeutic use in AD management. HIGHLIGHTS: Choline alfoscerate usage among newly diagnosed AD patients in Korea increased from 15.96% in 2012 to 47.65% in 2019.Male sex (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.05) and MedAid insurance coverage (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.07) were associated with higher odds of choline alfoscerate usage.Usage was more likely in patients with osteoarthritis (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.05) and less likely among those with hypertension (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.96), stroke/TIA (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.80), chronic kidney disease (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.80), and depression (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.93).Patients in rural areas had higher odds of using choline alfoscerate (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.28) compared to those in metropolitan areas (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.00).Despite limited evidence of efficacy, the extensive use of choline alfoscerate highlights the need for continuous monitoring and rigorous evaluation to ensure its safety and therapeutic value in AD management.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Predicting regional tau accumulation with machine learning-based tau-PET and advanced radiomics.",
        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is partially characterized by the progressive accumulation of aggregated tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. Although the association between accumulated tau, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline is critical for disease understanding and clinical trial design, we still lack robust tools to predict individualized trajectories of tau accumulation. Our objective was to assess whether brain imaging biomarkers of flortaucipir-positron emission tomography (PET), in combination with clinical and genomic measures, could predict future pathological tau accumulation. METHODS: We quantified the disease profile of participants (N = 276) using a comprehensive set of descriptors, including clinical/demographic (age, diagnosis, amyloid status, sex, race, ethnicity), genetic (apolipoprotein E [APOE]-\u03b54), and flortaucipir-PET imaging measures (regional flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio [SUVr] and comprehensive radiomic texture features extracted from Automated Anatomical Labeling template regions). We trained an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm in a 2:1 split train-test configuration to derive a prognostic index that (i)\u00a0stratifies individualized brain regions including global (AD-signature region) and lobar regions (frontal, occipital, parietal, temporal) into stable/slow- and fast-progressors based on future tau accumulation, and (ii) forecasts individualized regional annualized-rate-of-change in flortaucipir-PET SUVr. Further, we developed an adaptive model incorporating flortaucipir-PET measurements from the baseline and intermediate timepoints to predict annualized-rate-of-change. RESULTS: In binary classification for predicting stable/slow- versus fast-progressors, the area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve was 0.86 in the AD-signature region and 0.83, 0.82, 0.84, and 0.83 in frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal regions, respectively. The trained models successfully predicted annualized-rate-of-change of flortaucipir-PET regional flortaucipir SUVr in AD-signature and lobar regions (Pearson-correlation [R]: AD-signature = 0.73; frontal = 0.73; occipital = 0.71; parietal = 0.70; temporal = 0.69). The models' performance in predicting annualized-rate-of-change slightly increased when imaging features from intermediate timepoints were used in the adaptive setting (R: AD-signature = 0.79; frontal = 0.87; occipital = 0.83; parietal = 0.74; temporal = 0.82). DISCUSSION: Taken together, our results propose a robust approach to predict future tau accumulation that may improve the ability to enroll, stratify, and gauge efficacy in clinical trial participants. HIGHLIGHTS: Machine learning predicts the future rate of tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.Tau prediction in lobar/global regions benefits from diverse multimodal features.This prognostic index can serve as a sensitive tool for patient stratification.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Up to 20% of older adults in the United States have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and about one-third of people with MCI are predicted to transition to Alzheimer's disease (AD) within 5 years. Standard cognitive assessments are long and require a trained technician to administer. We developed the first computerized adaptive test (CAT) based on multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) to more precisely, rapidly, and repeatedly assesses cognitive abilities across the adult lifespan. We present results for a prototype CAT (pCAT-COG) for assessment of global cognitive function. METHODS: We sampled items across five cognitive domains central to neuropsychological testing (episodic memory [EM], semantic memory/language [SM], working memory [WM], executive function/flexible thinking, and processing speed [PS]). The item bank consists of 54 items, with 9 items of varying difficulty drawn from six different cognitive tasks. Each of the 54 items has 3 response trials, yielding an ordinal score (0-3 trials correct). We also include three long-term memory items not designed for adaptive administration, for a total bank of 57 items. Calibration data were collected in-person and online, calibrated using a bifactor MIRT model, and pCAT-COG scores validated against a technician-administered neuropsychological battery. RESULTS: The bifactor MIRT model improved fit over a unidimensional IRT model (p\u00a0< 0.0001). The global pCAT-COG scores were inversely correlated with age (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.44, p\u00a0< 0.0001). Simulated adaptive administration of 11 items maintained a correlation of r\u00a0=\u00a00.94 with the total item bank scores. Significant differences between mild and no cognitive impairment (NCI) were found (effect size of 1.08\u00a0SD\u00a0units). The pCAT-COG correlated with clinician-based global measure (r\u00a0=\u00a00.64). DISCUSSION: MIRT-based CAT is feasible and valid for the assessment of global cognitive impairment, laying the foundation for the development of a full CAT-COG that will draw from a much larger item bank with both global and domain specific measures of cognitive impairment. HIGHLIGHTS: As Americans age, numbers at risk for developing cognitive impairment are increasing.Aging-related declines in cognition begins decades prior to the onset of obvious cognitive impairment.Traditional assessment is burdensome and requires trained clinicians.We developed an adaptive testing framework using multidimensional item response theory.It is comparable to lengthier in-person assessments that require trained psychometrists.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Hippocampal hyperactivity is a hallmark of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) that predicts progression in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). AGB101 is an extended-release formulation of levetiracetam in the dose range previously demonstrated to normalize hippocampal activity and improve cognitive performance in aMCI. The HOPE4MCI study was a 78-week trial to assess the progression of MCI due to AD. As reported in Mohs et\u00a0al., the decline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score (CDR-SB) was reduced by 40% in apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 non-carriers\u00a0over the 78-week duration of the study with a negligible effect in carriers. Here we report an exploratory analysis of the effects of AGB101 on neuroimaging and biomarker measures in the 44 APOE \u03b54 non-carriers who completed the 78-week protocol. METHODS: Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained at baseline and after 78 weeks were analyzed using the Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields software providing volume measures of key structures of the medial temporal lobe relevant to AD progression. Blood samples collected at 78 weeks in the study were analyzed for plasma biomarkers. RESULTS: Treatment with AGB101 significantly reduced atrophy of the left entorhinal cortex (ERC) compared to placebo. This reduction in atrophy was correlated with\u00a0less decline\u00a0in the CDR-SB score over\u00a078 weeks and with lower neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of neurodegeneration. DISCUSSION: The HOPE4MCI study showed that APOE \u03b54 non-carriers treated with AGB101 demonstrated a substantially more favorable treatment effect compared to carriers. Here we report that treatment with AGB101 in non-carriers of APOE \u03b54 significantly reduced atrophy of the left ERC over 78 weeks. That reduction in atrophy was closely coupled with the change in CDR-SB and with plasma NfL indicative of neurodegeneration in the brain. These exploratory analyses are consistent with a reduction in neurodegeneration in APOE \u03b54 non-carriers treated with AGB101 before a clinical diagnosis of dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: AGB101 slows entorhinal cortex (ERC) atrophy in apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 non-carriers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD).Slowing ERC atrophy by AGB101 is associated with less Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes decline.Slowing ERC atrophy by AGB101 is associated with lower neurofilament light chain.AGB101 treatment reduces neurodegeneration in APOE \u03b54 non-carriers with MCI due to AD.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Physical activity (PA) has been linked to reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. However, less is known about its effects in the AD preclinical stage. We aimed to investigate whether greater PA was associated with lower plasma biomarkers of AD pathology, neural injury, reactive astrocytes, and better cognition in individuals with autosomal-dominant AD due to the presenilin-1 E280A mutation who are virtually guaranteed to develop dementia. METHODS: Twenty-eight cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers (ages x\u0304 = 29.28) wore a FitBit Charge-4 for 14 days. We calculated their average steps to measure locomotion, and Training Impulse (TRIMP) to quantify the intensity and duration of PAs using heart rate. Plasma amyloid beta 42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau 181, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured. Cognition was assessed with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease word list learning and delayed recall, Trail Making Test Part A, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-version IV Digit Span Backward. We conducted multiple linear regressions controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and education. RESULTS: There were no associations among steps or TRIMP with plasma biomarkers or cognition. Greater TRIMP was related to higher GFAP levels. CONCLUSIONS: PA was not associated with cognition or plasma biomarkers. However, greater intensity and duration of PAs were related to higher GFAP. Participants engaged very little in moderate to vigorous PA. Therefore, light PA may not exert a significant protective effect in preclinical AD. Future work with larger samples and longitudinal data is needed to elucidate further the potential impact of PA on AD progression in the preclinical stages. HIGHLIGHTS: Locomotion (average steps) was not associated with plasma biomarkers or cognition.Greater training load (training impulse) was related to higher glial fibrillary acidic protein levels in mutation carriers.Light physical activity may not suffice to exert a protective effect on Alzheimer's disease.",

Participants were then randomized to learn their risk of AD by age 85 (range: 21%-55%) based on either Latino ethnicity and family history alone, or the same factors and their APOE genotype. Risk information is provided in a semi-structured genetic counseling session. Psychological impacts, health-related behavioral changes, and cognitive performance are evaluated 6 weeks, 9 months, and 15 months later via surveys and qualitative interviews. To promote cultural competence, study materials were developed by a multidisciplinary team including bilingual and bicultural staff, Latinx content experts, and genetic counselors. RESULTS: We sent invitations to 91,433 households; 5542 (6.1%) responded, 2120 completed the Baseline Survey (78.5% online; 21.5% via computer-assisted telephone interview), and 2087 were deemed eligible, yielding a response rate of 2.3%. Many participants expressed appreciation for the opportunity to contribute to AD research. We randomized 374 participants for the clinical trial. DISCUSSION: We describe the study design, recruitment and retention strategies, and interventions employed in the IDEAL Study. Our design provides a framework for future studies using rigorous mixed methods. Our findings may facilitate the development of culturally-sensitive educational materials about AD and genetic testing, as well as genetic counseling protocols, to improve coping and adjustment in response to receiving risk information.

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To report the development and performance of 2 distinct deep learning models trained exclusively on retinal color fundus photographs to classify Alzheimer disease (AD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two independent datasets (UK Biobank and our tertiary academic institution) of good-quality retinal photographs derived from patients with AD and controls were used to build 2 deep learning models, between April 1, 2021, and January 30, 2024. ADVAS is a U-Net-based architecture that uses retinal vessel segmentation. ADRET is a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers style self-supervised learning convolutional neural network pretrained on a large data set of retinal color photographs from UK Biobank. The models' performance to distinguish AD from non-AD was determined using mean accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and receiving operating curves. The generated attention heatmaps were analyzed for distinctive features. RESULTS: The self-supervised ADRET model had superior accuracy when compared with ADVAS, in both UK Biobank (98.27% vs 77.20%; P<.001) and our institutional testing data sets (98.90% vs 94.17%; P=.04). No major differences were noted between the original and binary vessel segmentation and between both eyes vs single-eye models. Attention heatmaps obtained from patients with AD highlighted regions surrounding small vascular branches as areas of highest relevance to the model decision making. CONCLUSION: A bidirectional encoder representations from transformers style self-supervised convolutional neural network pretrained on a large data set of retinal color photographs alone can screen symptomatic AD with high accuracy, better than U-Net-pretrained models. To be translated in clinical practice, this methodology requires further validation in larger and diverse populations and integrated techniques to harmonize fundus photographs and attenuate the imaging-associated noise.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Inspecting the external world: Memory capacity, but not memory self-efficacy, predicts offloading in working memory.",
        "AbstractText": "Individuals with memory impairments may need to rely often on the external world (i.e. offloading). By memorizing only a fraction of the items at hand, and repeatedly looking back to the remainder of items (i.e. inspecting), they can avoid frailty or effortful memory use. However, individuals with subjective concerns may also prefer to rely on the external world even though their capacity is intact. Crucially, capacity assessment fails to recognize offloading strategies, while inspection assessment may reveal how people choose to deploy memory in everyday life. To disentangle the relative contributions of memory capacity and memory self-efficacy to offloading behavior, we recruited 29 individuals who were referred to a memory clinic and 38 age-matched individuals. We assessed memory capacity using neuropsychological measures, and memory self-efficacy using questionnaires. Inspection behavior was assessed in a copy task that allowed participants to store information to their preferred load or to rely on the external world. Referred individuals had lower capacity scores and lower memory self-efficacy. They inspected as often as controls, but used longer inspections and performed worse. Across all subjects, memory capacity - but not memory self-efficacy - explained inspection frequency and duration, with higher capacity associated with fewer and shorter inspections. Capacity measures thus translate to how people choose to deploy their memory in tasks that do not force full capacity use. However, people generally avoided remembering more than two items per inspection, and thus avoided using their full capacity. Inspection behavior was not further explained by memory self-efficacy, suggesting that inspections are not a sensitive measure of constraints experienced in everyday life. Although we provide support for the predictive value of capacity tasks in tasks with more degrees of freedom, capacity tasks overlook offloading behavior that individuals may employ to avoid using their full memory capacity in everyday life.",

The objective of this study is to identify the association between ACP codes and healthcare utilization in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: This is a multicenter cohort study using real-world electronic health data. Using the TriNetX database, we collected electronic health data from 92 institutions in the United States. We included patients aged 65 and older who had been diagnosed with one of four neurological diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Patients with congestive heart failure were included as a reference. From the 64,683,009 total patients in the database, 877,138 had Alzheimer's disease, 544,610 had Parkinson's disease, 208,341 had multiple sclerosis, 9,944 had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 1,500,186 had congestive heart failure. For each disease, we compared hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits over a two-year period between patients with and without ACP codes documented. Then, in patients with ACP, we investigated the rates of hospitalizations and ED visits over the two\u00a0years before ACP and two\u00a0years after ACP to understand the impact of ACP on the healthcare utilization trend. All patients had records for at least two\u00a0years after index. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The rate of ACP code documentation ranged from 1.8% of multiple sclerosis patients to 3.6% of Alzheimer's disease patients. After matching for demographic and health variables, usage of ACP codes was associated with significantly fewer hospitalizations for Alzheimer's disease patients. Across all diseases, there was a 20% to 30% decrease in ED visits, which was significant. Furthermore, there was a significant change in the trend of hospitalizations and ED visits for patients after ACP documentation. Patients went from increasing utilization before ACP documentation to decreasing utilization after documentation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: ACP billing codes are used infrequently in neurological disease, which may indicate that reimbursement alone is not sufficient to drive code usage. Usage of ACP billing codes was associated with decreased healthcare utilization, particularly in terms of ED visits. Beyond the primary objective of providing goal-concordant care, ACP may impact the economic burden of chronic neurodegenerative disease, which has high costs of care in our aging society. There may be particular benefits with Alzheimer's disease, which had an impact on both hospitalizations and ED visits and is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Future work is needed to better understand the best implementation strategy for ACP in a multifaceted approach that emphasizes patient care preferences for their illness.",

        "AbstractText": "Vascular dementia (VaD) is a second most common type of dementia subsequent to Alzheimer disease (AD). VaD is characterized by cognitive impairment and memory loss that may progress due to the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) a hallmark of AD. CAA triggers the progression of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes with the subsequent the development of VaD and mixed dementia. Early diagnosis of patients with appropriate use of anti-inflammatory can prevent CAA-related inflammation and VaD development. Currently, there are no effective drugs in the management of VaD. Of note, cholesterol-lowering agent statins which are commonly used in patients with vascular diseases and dyslipidemia may affect the progression of VaD. Many previous studies highlighted the potential therapeutic efficacy of statins in treating VaD. Though, the underlying mechanisms of statins in prevention and treatment of VaD are not fully clarified.

Understanding the relative risk of suicide between subtypes of dementia is important for services to offer appropriate intervention. METHOD: We searched five databases from inception to July 2023 for peer-reviewed publications reporting suicidal ideation, suicide attempt or death by suicide for at least two dementia subtypes. Meta-analyses compared suicidality between subtypes of dementia with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). RESULTS: From 4983 studies identified, 12 met inclusion criteria. Pooling data, people with Vascular Dementia were significantly more likely to experience suicidal ideation (OR= 2.02 [95\u202f% CI= 1.06;3.8]) and attempt suicide (OR=1.94 [95\u202f% CI= 1.28;2.94]) than people with AD, but not die by suicide (OR= 1.05 [95\u202f% CI= 0.69;1.59]). People with Dementia with Lewy Bodies were significantly more likely to report suicidal ideation (OR= 1.56 [95\u202f% CI= 1.09;2.23]) than AD but not attempt suicide (OR= 1.12 [95\u202f% CI= 0.83;1.50]).

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether later-life changes in subjective cognition and behavior - potential markers of Alzheimer disease - could be observed in cognitively unimpaired older persons with a history of suspected mild traumatic brain injury (smTBI) earlier in life and whether changes in cognition and behavior mediated the link between smTBI and daily function. METHODS: Data for 1392 participants from the Canadian Platform for Research Online to Investigate Health, Quality of Life, Cognition, Behaviour, Function, and Caregiving in Aging were analyzed. A validated self-reported brain injury screening questionnaire was used to determine the history of smTBI. Outcomes were measured using the Everyday Cognition scale (for subjective cognitive decline [SCD]), Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI) Checklist, and Standard Assessment of Global Everyday Activities (for function). Inverse probability of treatment weighted logistic and negative binomial regressions were used to model smTBI (exposure) associations with SCD and MBI\u00a0statuses, and Everyday Cognition-II and MBI Checklist total scores, respectively. Mediation analyses were conducted using bootstrapping. RESULTS: History of smTBI was linked to higher odds of SCD (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.45, 95% confidence interval: [1.14-1.84]) or MBI (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.75, 95% confidence interval: [1.54-1.98]), as well as 24% (95% confidence interval: [18%-31%]) higher Everyday Cognition-II and 52% (95% confidence interval: [41%-63%]) higher MBI Checklist total scores. Finally, SCD and MBI\u00a0mediated approximately 45% and 56%, respectively, of the association between smTBI history and poorer function, as indicated by higher Standard Assessment of Global Everyday Activities total scores. CONCLUSIONS: smTBI at any point in the life course is linked to poorer cognition and behavior even in community-dwelling older persons without MCI or dementia. Older persons with smTBI may benefit from early dementia risk assessment using tools that measure changes in cognition and behavior. Interventions for declining cognition and behavior may also be beneficial in this population to address functional impairment.",

This study maps the 10/66 algorithm for dementia classification, widely used and validated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), to the U.S. Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), the dementia sub-study of the Health and Retirement Study, and assesses its performance in ADAMS. We identified the subset of 10/66 algorithm items comparably measured in ADAMS, then used these items to re-train the 10/66 algorithm against the ADAMS clinical dementia diagnosis, employing k-fold cross-validation to assess performance. We compared the modified 10/66 algorithm to four other dementia classification algorithms previously validated in ADAMS, both for overall dementia estimation as well as for estimating education gradients. The modified 10/66 algorithm had higher sensitivity (87%) and specificity (93%) than the comparison algorithms. All of the algorithms over-estimated the education gradient in dementia, although the modest ADAMS sample size precludes precise comparisons of education gradient accuracy. Overall, we found that the modified 10/66 algorithm performs well in classifying dementia status in the U.S. Our results support the validity of risk factor comparisons between U.S. and 10/66 LMIC dementia datasets.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Nepal, like other low- and middle-income countries, is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults and the rate of aging in the population. This has increased the number of older adults with age-associated chronic illnesses, which in turn will escalate the demand for specialized healthcare and long-term care in Nepal. However, very little is known regarding the current healthcare system and health policies for older adults in Nepal. In this paper, we aimed to advance this understanding. METHODS: We reviewed the existing literature on the health, healthcare system, and policies related to older adults in Nepal. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that older adults have a high prevalence of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and chronic kidney diseases, and the number of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is on the rise. Additionally, there is a decline in historical family caregiving for several reasons such as international migration of offspring, and the country currently lacks a skilled geriatric workforce and formal long-term care support and services (LTSS). Together, this has created a challenge in adequately meeting the health and care needs of the older population. Findings also indicated that several geriatric health policies exist in the country, which ensure primarily free healthcare services for older adults. However, economic constraints limit the financial resources to implement these policies, build appropriate care facilities, and improve access and utilization. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the government must develop sustainable financing to adequately provide quality healthcare and LTSS for older adults as the population ages.",

To date, the majority of metabolomics studies have focused on AD, resulting in a relative paucity of research on early-stage conditions such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underexplored. In this study, we employed a comprehensive platform for the early screening of individuals with MCI using high-throughput targeted metabolomics. METHOD: We included 171 participants including 124 individuals with MCI and 47 healthy subjects. Univariate statistical analysis was conducted using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, with p-values corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The screening criteria were set at FDR < 0.05 and fold change (FC) > 1.5 or < 0.67. Multivariate analysis was performed using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), where differential metabolites were identified based on variable influence on projection (VIP) scores (VIP > 1 and FDR < 0.05). Random forest analysis was used to further evaluate the ability of the metabolic data to distinguish effectively between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 14 differential metabolites were identified, leading to the discovery of a biomarker panel consisting of three plasma metabolites including uric acid, pyruvic acid and isolithocholic acid that effectively distinguished MCI patients from healthy subjects. DISCUSSION: These findings have provided a comprehensive metabolic profile, offering valuable insights into the early prediction and understanding of the pathogenic processes underlying MCI. This study holds the potential for advancing early detection and intervention strategies for MCI.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The 3xTg-AD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important tool to investigate the relationship between development of pathological amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments. Traditional behavioral tasks assessing aspects of learning and memory, such as mazes requiring spatial navigation, unfortunately suffer from several shortcomings, including the stress of human handling and not probing species-typical behavior. The automated IntelliCage system was developed to circumvent such issues by testing mice in a social environment while measuring multiple aspects of cognition. Water consumption can serve as a primary motivator for task engagement. Once animals adapt to the cage and can access water, mice can be subjected to operant tasks. Each of the four corners of a cage contains doors to manipulate access to water, visual LED cues, and a valve allowing administration of an air puff. Previously, we detected significant impairments in 3xTg-AD mice in the IntelliCage, however a high failure rate and genotypical differences in water motivation were observed. METHODS: Here, we implemented an IntelliCage paradigm where mice underwent progressively more difficult reaction time tasks to assess attention and impulsivity, behaviors mediated by the prefrontal cortex. Mice were placed in the IntelliCage at 11.5 months of age, which corresponds with the presence of widespread pathology. RESULTS: As the difficulty of the reaction time tasks increased, 3xTg-AD mice exhibited lower percent Correct Responses than NonTg. When implementing varying pre-cue durations, where animals are required to wait between the initiation of the trial and the LED turning on (which then requires a nose-poke to access water), 3xTg-AD mice prematurely nose-poked on trials requiring a longer delay before a second nose poke would allow water access, demonstrating heightened impulsivity. The presence of soluble and insoluble fractions of cortical A\u03b240 and 42, and phosphorylated tau epitopes threonine 181 and serine 396 confirmed the presence of neuropathological hallmarks in 3xTg-AD mice. CONCLUSION: Together, this study describes a novel protocol that overcomes motivational differences and detects attention and impulsivity deficits in 3xTg-AD mice utilizing the IntelliCage.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a crucial role in lipid homeostasis, predominantly expressed in astrocytes and to a lesser extent in microglia within the central nervous system (CNS). While the APOE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), its precise role in AD pathogenesis remains elusive. Apoe-knockout (Apoe-ko) mice, mice expressing human APOE4, and human APOE4 carriers exhibit similar deficits in lipid metabolism, cognitive and behavioral functions, and neurodegeneration. The retina, as part of the CNS, has been studied to investigate the underlying mechanisms of AD, including neuroinflammation, amyloid aggregation, and neurodegeneration. This study explores ApoE's role in AD by analyzing brain and eye samples from Apoe-ko mice, focusing on identifying potential retinal biomarkers associated with ApoE dysfunction. METHODS: We compared female Apoe-ko mice on a regular diet to age-matched C57BL/6J controls at 3 and 9\u202fmonths. Our investigations included microRNAs (miRNAs), their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and selected protein markers, including astroglial (Gfap), microglial/macrophage (Iba1 and Trem2) markers, and amyloid precursor protein (APP)/amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides implicated in AD pathogenesis. We also examined female Apoe-ko mice on a high-fat diet versus a regular diet at 9\u202fmonths for differential miRNA and mRNA expressions. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that miRNA levels were generally lower in 3-month-old Apoe-ko mice but increased in 9-month-old mice across five distinct brain regions, as well as in eye tissue and tear fluid. A high-fat diet further enhanced miRNA dysregulation in brain and eye tissues, but not in tear fluid. Target mRNAs were generally higher in the neocortex-hippocampus and eye tissue of 3-month-old Apoe-ko mice but decreased with age, except for glial cell mRNAs like Gfap and Aif1. Protein analysis revealed elevated Gfap expression, and increased APP/A\u03b2 peptide accumulation in the neocortex-hippocampus, including brain endothelial cells at the meninges, as well as in the retina of 9-month-old Apoe-ko mice. These findings highlight ApoE's pivotal role in AD, demonstrating its impact on inflammatory and amyloidogenic/angiogenic miRNA expression, glial homeostasis, and APP/A\u03b2 peptide clearance. The observed upregulation of proinflammatory miR-146a and anti-amyloidogenic/angiogenic miR-15a in 9-month-old Apoe-ko mice suggests their potential as tear-based biomarkers for ApoE dysfunction.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Anxiety and depression-like symptoms occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Hippocampal Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling mediates anxiety- and depression-like behavior. Exercise training improves anxiety and depression-like behavior in various disease models, such as the rat chronic restraint stress model, rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder, and rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Here, we aimed to investigate whether exercise ameliorates anxiety- and depression like behaviors in APP/PS1 mice and explore the potential mechanisms. METHODS: After eight weeks of exercise intervention, we assessed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice. We then measured the levels of SIRT1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1\u03b1), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and mitochondrial biogenesis (CO2, ATP6, and mitochondrial content) using immunofluorescence, reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR, and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, we investigated the effects of pharmacological activation of SIRT1 on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, the SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1/NRF1/TFAM signaling axis, and mitochondrial biogenesis. RESULTS: We first observed that treadmill exercise improved anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in six-month-old APP/PS1 mice and increased SIRT1 levels in the hippocampus. Pharmacological activation of hippocampal SIRT1 function also reduced anxiety and depression-like behaviors in APP/PS1 mice. Meanwhile, both treadmill exercise and pharmacological activation of hippocampal SIRT1 increased the levels of PGC1\u03b1, NRF1, TFAM, and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis (CO2, ATP6, or mitochondrial content) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: These findings reveal that treadmill exercise reduces anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in six-month-old APP/PS1 mice by enhancing the SIRT1-dependent PGC-1\u03b1/NRF1/TFAM axis, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in the hippocampus.",

Integrating arts therapies into telehealth has become increasingly important to improve accessibility for people with mobility impairments or those living in remote areas. This study aims to map the existing body of literature to provide an in-depth overview of telehealth in arts therapies for individuals with NNDs. METHODOLOGY: This scoping review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Six databases were systematically searched, with 2,888 articles screened for eligibility. Inclusion criteria focused on primary research peer-reviewed articles in English that addressed telehealth arts therapies for NNDs. RESULTS: Seventeen telehealth studies published between 2009 and March 2024 were included, with a notable increase in publications after 2020. The studies covered various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Rett syndrome, and neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, central nervous system (CNS) tumors, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, and mild cognitive impairment. Music therapy was the most widely studied modality. Interventions ranged from therapeutic singing and songwriting to virtual reality experiences. Different platforms and specialized virtual environments were used alongside pre-recorded sessions. Positive benefits included psychological enrichment, social connectivity, cognitive improvements, and brain changes, although some studies reported mixed or no significant effects in certain areas. CONCLUSION: Telehealth in arts therapies significantly benefits individuals with NNDs, improving accessibility and providing psychological, emotional, social, and cognitive benefits. The positive benefits observed highlight the potential of these interventions to improve overall well-being and daily functioning.

Appeals have therefore been made for the development of evidence-based empathy-enhancing experiential learning and training models. Bringing Art to Life (BATL) is a service-learning program designed within experiential learning pedagogy for psychology and pre-healthcare students. Intergenerational relationships are fostered with people with dementia through art therapy and life story/narrative at a community-based adult day services center. METHODS: In this sequential mixed methods study, quantitative data were collected via electronic surveys of students in this course compared with students in didactic introductory psychology or psychology and aging courses. Survey measures included empathy, mindfulness, positive and negative affect, future time perspective, and attitudes toward older adults and working with people with dementia. Weekly BATL student journals submitted as part of their course requirements were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Within-subjects analyses of variance revealed increases in empathy and positive affect, broadened time perspective, and improved attitudes toward older adults and people with dementia among students in the BATL course compared with other undergraduate students. Analysis of BATL student journals supported and deepened understanding of these findings, with themes including attitude change, relationship building fostering existential awareness and self-development, art fostering social interactions, and perceived program effectiveness. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that BATL strongly supports increased empathetic attitudes and decreased stigma of aging in psychology and pre-healthcare students. Intergenerational expressive arts-based programs like BATL should be implemented in healthcare education to enhance empathy and improve attitudes toward aging and dementia care.",

As the origins of those proteinopathies have been biochemically traced and genetically mapped, genetically engineered animal models carrying the specific mutations or variants are widely used for investigating the etiology of these diseases, as well as for testing potential therapeutics. This article focuses on the mouse models of Alzheimer disease and closely related frontotemporal dementia, particularly the ones that have provided most valuable knowledge, or are in a trajectory of doing so. More importantly, some of the major findings from these models are summarized, based on the recent single-cell transcriptomics, multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics studies. While no model is perfect, it is hoped that the new insights from these models and the practical use of these models will continue to help to establish a path forward.",

        "AbstractText": "Ferritin-based hybrids are large 24-subunit macromolecules of megadalton scale have prospective applications ranging from drug delivery to recombinant vaccines, however, their rational design is challenging. Here, we architectured hybrids based on ferritin subunits from Helicobacter pylori and ones fused with a homolog of the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier protein. We firstly revealed the stochastic nature of bacterial ferritin-based hybrids self-assembly by observing a sequential range of stoichiometries at totally different sample preparation procedures: coexpression in Escherichia coli cells and pH-dependent dis/reassembly. We developed an approach of quantitative evaluation of stoichiometry distribution by using a model based on random, unambiguous, and stoichiometry-independent assembly of hexamers into 24-meric hybrid globules. We identified the presence of a heterodimer and found unexpectedly disfavored stoichiometries of hexamers, which determined the narrowing of structural diversity patterns of 24-mers and shifted the stoichiometry distribution from the random one. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the shift in structural diversity patterns of ferritin-based hybrid globules. Finally, the combination of our model system and the hexamer-based approach provides a robust platform for the rational design of ferritin-based systems, with potential applications in drug delivery, structure-based immunogen design, and beyond.",

        "AbstractText": "This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limitations of Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). NT-3, a critical neurotrophic factor, plays essential roles in hippocampal neuron growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity, making it a promising candidate for AD treatment. However, its clinical application is hindered by its inability to cross the BBB. To address this, we utilized genetic engineering techniques to fuse the TAT transmembrane peptide with NT-3, producing a recombinant NT-3 (T-NT-3) with enhanced membrane-penetrating capability. Protein characterization confirmed that T-NT-3 possesses good stability and the ability to cross the BBB. In vitro experiments demonstrated that T-NT-3 inhibits oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses in neural cells by activating TrkC receptors and suppressing M1 microglial activation. In vivo, T-NT-3 improved cognitive and memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice and reduced AD-associated pathological changes. These findings highlight the mechanisms by which T-NT-3 alleviates hippocampal neurotoxicity, providing a foundation for its future application as a recombinant protein therapy for AD.",

Existing research indicates the necessity of developing multifunctional nanomaterials to facilitate multi-target therapy. In this work, we designed and prepared multifunctional selenium-doped carbonized polymer dots (SeCDs), and examined the multifunctionality at inhibiting A\u03b2, cleaning reactive oxygen species (ROS), and modulating copper ions. SeCDs exhibit efficient clearance of active hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion radicals. In addition, SeCDs can chelate Cu ions, therefore reducing the cytotoxicity linked to the A\u03b2-Cu complex. More importantly, SeCDs can effectively reduce the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species. This study demonstrates the potential of carbon dots as a multifunctional \u03b2-sheet disruptor, while multifunctional SeCDs offer promising avenues for further research in the multi-target treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, this strategy provides a new perspective on the development of zero-dimensional carbon materials in Alzheimer's therapy.",

A systematic review of the effect of AD co-pathology on longitudinal clinical outcomes in LBD was conducted. A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (October 2024) yielded n\u00a0=\u00a03558 records that were screened by two independent reviewers. Included studies (n\u00a0=\u00a031) assessed AD co-pathology in LBD by neuropathologic examination (n\u00a0=\u00a010), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (n\u00a0=\u00a07), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n\u00a0=\u00a08) or plasma biomarkers (n\u00a0=\u00a06); and reported longitudinal clinical outcomes including cognitive and functional decline, mortality, or treatment response. Most neuropathology, PET and plasma studies reviewed demonstrated poorer prognosis in LBD\u00a0+\u00a0compared to LBD-, but discrepant findings were seen among CSF studies. No included study reported better outcomes in LBD+. The risk of bias was assessed with the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. All studies rated as low risk of bias (n\u00a0=\u00a012) reported that the presence of AD co-pathology in LBD (LBD+) was associated with accelerated cognitive decline (n\u00a0=\u00a07/7), accelerated functional decline (n\u00a0=\u00a03/3), greater mortality (n\u00a0=\u00a02/2) and poorer response to treatment (n\u00a0=\u00a01/1).

METHODS: This study involved 200 patients diagnosed with convulsive status epilepticus (CSE), of whom 73 were RCSE and 127 were non-RCSE. Variables included demographic information, lifestyle factors, medical history, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, neuroimaging characteristics, laboratory tests, and nutritional scores. A predictive model was developed through multivariable logistic regression analysis. The model's predictive performance and clinical utility were evaluated using various metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, GiViTI calibration belt, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Additionally, we performed internal five-fold cross-validation for this model. RESULTS: We developed a nomogram model with six predictors: age\u00a0\u2264\u00a040\u00a0years, prior history of epilepsy, presence of epileptic foci, duration of CSE\u00a0>\u00a030\u00a0min, c-reactive protein\u00a0>\u00a06\u00a0mg/L, and nutritional risk screening\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 points.

        "AbstractText": "Pregnancy is a unique phase in a woman's life marked by profound physical transformations, including changes in body shape and weight. The Body Understanding Measure for Pregnancy Scale (BUMPs) was designed to assess body image during pregnancy. Despite its increasing use, the scale has not yet been adapted into Italian, and evidence regarding its predictive validity with respect to anxiety, depression, and body appreciation is lacking. This study aimed to address these gaps to validate the Italian BUMPs and test its predictive validity. A community sample of 726 Italian pregnant women was recruited (age range 18-48, Mage= 31.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.79). Participants completed a translated BUMPs and other self-report questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, and body appreciation. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a three-factor structure for the BUMPs, with dimensions assessing Satisfaction with Appearing Pregnant, Weight Gain Concerns, and Physical Burdens of Pregnancy. BUMPs subscales demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (\u03c9 = 0.765-0.866). Cross-sectional analysis revealed that BUMPs scores correlated with anxiety (r range from 0.25 to 0.32), depression (r range from 0.31 to 0.34), and gestational body mass index (r range from 0.18 to 0.37). Longitudinal analysis associated BUMPs with anxiety, depression, and body appreciation measured after childbirth, providing evidence of predictive validity. Overall, the present study supports the BUMPs as a valid and reliable tool for assessing body image during pregnancy within the Italian context. Additionally, it provides the first evidence of the BUMPs' predictive validity for postpartum mental health outcomes and body appreciation after childbirth.",

In addition, neuroinflammation and impaired iron metabolism in the brain are involved in the pathogenesis of AD, which ultimately leads to progressive neuronal death and dementia. It was found that the retina of patients with AMD also accumulates A\u03b2 and iron, as well as A\u03b2 and p-tau in retinal ganglion cells affected by glaucoma, and concomitant inflammation aggravates the pathological process. Patients with AD experience a marked decline in visual function which is thought to develop before the decline in cognitive function.

However, current treatments often show limited efficacy in certain patients and are associated with adverse effects, which highlights the need for safer and more effective therapeutic approaches. Environmental factors, particularly dietary habits, have been observed to play a substantial role in the development of MS. In this study, we are the first to investigate the potential protective effect of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) in MS. ABA, which is abundant in fruits such as figs, apricots and bilberries, is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in conditions like depression and Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In this study, we investigated whether ABA supplementation enhances remyelination in both ex vivo and in vivo mouse models. RESULTS: Our results indicated that ABA enhanced remyelination and that this enhanced remyelination is associated with increased lipid droplet load, reduced levels of degraded myelin, and a higher abundance of F4/80+ cells in the demyelinated brain of mice treated with ABA. In in vitro models, we further demonstrated that ABA treatment elevates lipid droplet formation by enhancing the phagocytic capacity of macrophages. Additionally, in a mouse model of microglial activation, we showed that ABA-treated mice maintain a less inflammatory microglial phenotype. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight a crucial role for macrophages and microglia in enabling ABA to enhance the remyelination process. Furthermore, ABA's ability to improve remyelination together with its ability to reduce microglial activation, make ABA a promising candidate for modulating macrophage phenotype and reducing neuroinflammation in MS.",

Numerous studies have shown that cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest are associated with the occurrence of neuroinflammation, accompanied by the activation of microglia. Microglia, as macrophages in the central nervous system, play an irreplaceable role in neuroinflammation. Current research on neuroinflammation induced by microglia activation mainly focuses on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain, acquired brain injury, and others. However, there is relatively limited research on microglia and neuroinflammation under conditions of cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The close relationship between cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, and cardiac surgery underscores the importance of identifying targets for intervening in neuroinflammation through microglia. This could greatly benefit cardiac surgery patients during cardiopulmonary bypass and the perioperative period, significantly improving patient prognosis. This review article provides the first comprehensive discussion on the signaling pathways associated with neuroinflammation triggered by microglia activation, the impact of cardiopulmonary bypass on microglia, as well as the current status and advancements in cardiopulmonary bypass animal models. It provides new insights and methods for the treatment of neuroinflammation related to cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, holding significant importance for clinical treatment by cardiac surgeons, management strategies by cardiopulmonary bypass physicians, and the development of neurologically related medications.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of published amisulpride population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models in schizophrenia patients with an external data set and establish remedial dosing regimens for nonadherent amisulpride-treated patients. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify PopPK models for evaluation. The evaluation process involved analyzing 390 serum concentration samples obtained from 361 Chinese adult inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Model predictability was evaluated by prediction-based and simulation-based diagnostics. Based on validation results, a modified PopPK model was constructed to characterize amisulpride pharmacokinetic in our patients. Monte Carlo simulation was employed to investigate non-adherence scenarios and the impact of subsequently administered remedial regimens. RESULTS: In the five assessed published models, four included trough concentrations from schizophrenia patients, and one combined single-dose data from healthy older adults and trough concentrations from older adults with Alzheimer's disease. The PE for population and individual predictions ranged from -92.89% to 27.02% and -24.82% to 4.04%, respectively. In the simulation-based diagnostics, the NPDE results indicated noticeable bias in all models. Therefore, a modified one-compartment model, with estimated creatinine clearance(eCLcr) as covariates on the apparent clearance (CL/F) of amisulpride, was developed. For delays in medication dosing, if the delay is within 12\u00a0hours, take half the missed dose right away, then resume the normal schedule; if the delay is up to 24\u00a0hours, just continue with the regular dosing schedule. CONCLUSION: Existing published models lack the necessary reliability for cross-center application. Future prospective studies are required to assess our model before integrating it into clinical practice. Model-based simulations provided a rational approach to propose remedial strategies for delayed or missed doses.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Cold inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) is an important danger-associated molecular pattern involved in tissue-specific and systemic inflammation related to inflammation and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the precise roles and mechanism of CIRP in the functional changes in astrocytes during the development of AD are still unknown. This study aimed to assess gene expression alterations in astrocytes after they overexpress CIRP (oe-CIRP) and to explore the relationship between abnormal CIRP expression and AD. METHODS: We created astrocyte cell lines with a CIRP or control vector expression using three human glioma cell lines U87, U251 and H4, and analyzed the mRNA expression profiles of 3 pairs of cells via microarray. Bioinformatics identified differentially expressed mRNAs between CIRP-overexpressing (ov-CIRP) and control groups, validated by q-PCR and Western blotting (WB). Finally, the effect of CIRP overexpression in astrocytes on neurons was observed in a coculture system. RESULTS: We identified 119 mRNAs with obvious fold changes between the ov-CIRP and control groups for all 3 pairs of human glioma cell lines. The biological functional analysis indicated that urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a gene whose expression significantly decreased after CIRP overexpression, was closely associated with AD. WB and q-PCR confirmed that CIRP overexpression significantly inhibited uPA at both mRNA and protein levels in U87, U251 and H4 cells. Moreover, compared with those cocultured with control astrocytes, SH-SY5Y cells cocultured with CIRP-overexpressing astrocytes exhibited a significant increase in the expression of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)1-42 and the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (Tau). CONCLUSION: CIRP overexpression in astrocytes inhibits uPA expression, promoting A\u03b21-42 production and tau phosphorylation in neurons, thereby increasing AD risk. These results suggest that the overexpression of CIRP in astrocytes contributes to the development of AD.",

Measuring concomitant pathology in vivo can improve clinical and research diagnoses and prediction of cognitive trajectories. Tau PET imaging may serve a dual role in Lewy body disease by measuring cortical tau aggregation as well as assessing dopaminergic loss attributed to binding to neuromelanin within substantia nigra. We sought to characterize 18F-PI-2620, a next generation PET tracer, in individuals with Lewy body disease. We recruited 141 participants for 18F-PI-2620 PET scans from the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Stanford Aging and Memory Study, most of whom also had \u03b2-amyloid status available (139/141) from PET or cerebrospinal fluid. We compared 18F-PI-2620 uptake within entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, precuneus and lingual gyrus, as well as substantia nigra, across participants with Lewy body disease [Parkinson's disease (n = 29), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 14)] and Alzheimer's disease (n = 28), in addition to cognitively unimpaired healthy older adults (n = 70). Mean bilateral signal was extracted from cortical regions of interest in 18F-PI-2620 standard uptake value ratio (inferior cerebellar grey reference) images normalized to template space. A subset of participants received cognitive testing and/or the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III motor exam (off medication). 18F-PI-2620 uptake was low overall in Lewy body disease and correlated with \u03b2-amyloid PET in temporal lobe regions and precuneus. Moreover, inferior temporal 18F-PI-2620 uptake was significantly elevated in \u03b2-amyloid positive relative to \u03b2-amyloid negative participants with Lewy body disease. Temporal lobe 18F-PI-2620 signal was not associated with memory in Lewy body disease, but uptake within precuneus and lingual gyrus was associated with worse executive function and attention/working memory performance. Finally, substantia nigra 18F-PI-2620 signal was significantly reduced in participants with Parkinson's disease, and lower substantia nigra signal was associated with greater motor impairment. These findings suggest that although levels are lower than in Alzheimer's disease, small elevations in cortical tau are associated with cognitive function in Lewy body disease relevant domains, and that reduced 18F-PI-2620 binding in substantia nigra may represent loss of dopaminergic neurons. Cortical tau and neuromelanin binding within substantia nigra represent two unique signals in the same PET image that may be informative in the context of cognitive and motor deficits, respectively, in Lewy body disease.",

        "AbstractText": "The preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease represents a crucial time window for therapeutic intervention but requires the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers that are sensitive to the effects of disease-modifying drugs. Amyloid peptide and tau proteins, the main histological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, have been widely used as biomarkers of anti-amyloid and anti-tau drugs. However, these biomarkers do not fully capture the multiple biological pathways of the brain. Indeed, robust amyloid-target engagement by anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies has recently translated into modest cognitive and clinical benefits in Alzheimer's disease patients, albeit with potentially life-threatening side effects. Moreover, targeting the tau pathway has yet to result in any positive clinical outcomes. Findings from computational neuroscience have demonstrated that brain regions do not work in isolation but are interconnected within complex network structures. Brain connectivity studies suggest that misfolded proteins can spread through these connections, leading to the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease is a pathology of network disconnectivity. Based on these assumptions, here we discuss how incorporating brain connectivity outcomes could better capture global brain functionality and, in conjunction with traditional Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, could facilitate the clinical development of new disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer's disease drugs.",

The efficacy of palliative sedation needs to be monitored to ensure patient comfort. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy using discomfort levels combined with sedation/agitation levels. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, adult patients with advanced malignancies were recruited from hospice units, palliative care units, and hospital wards in five European countries. Health care professionals used proxy observations of discomfort levels (Discomfort Scale-Dementia of Alzheimer Type, range 0-27) and sedation/agitation levels (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale modified for palliative care inpatients), range\u2009-\u20095 to\u2009+\u20094) to evaluate the efficacy of palliative sedation. RESULTS: In 78 participants, discomfort levels were monitored during palliative sedation. The mean discomfort score before start was 9.4 points (95% CI 8.3-10.5), which showed a significant decrease of 6.0 points (95% CI 4.8-7.1) after start of sedation for the total sedation period. In the multivariable analysis, no significant factors influencing baseline discomfort levels were identified. The discomfort and depth of sedation scores were found to be positively correlated, with an r of 0.72 (95% CI 0.61-0.82). The internal consistency of the discomfort scale was good (0.83), but the \"Noisy breathing\" item was less informative of the total discomfort score. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of palliative sedation can be evaluated by measuring discomfort levels combined with sedation/agitation levels. The measurement of discomfort levels might provide a more specific and detailed evaluation of adequate sedation.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a diverse neurodegenerative disease, is the leading cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80\u00a0% of all cases. The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is unknown, and there is no cure at this time. Recent developments in transcriptome-wide profiling have led to the identification of a number of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among these, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)-long transcripts that don't seem to be able to code for proteins-have drawn attention because they function as regulatory agents in a variety of biological processes. Recent research suggests that lncRNAs play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by modulating tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid production, synaptic impairment, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, though their precise effects on the disorder are unknown. The biology and modes of action of the best-characterized lncRNAs in AD will be outlined here, with an emphasis on their possible involvement in the pathophysiology of the disease. As lncRNAs may offer prospective prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD, a greater comprehension of the molecular processes and the intricate network of interactions in which they are implicated could pave the way for future research.",

        "AbstractText": "The formation of the pyroglutamate variant of amyloid beta (pGlu-A\u03b2), which is extremely hydrophobic, rapidly aggregating, and highly neurotoxic, is mediated by the action of secretory glutaminyl cyclase (sQC). The pGlu-A\u03b2 often acts as a seed for the aggregation of the full length A\u03b2 and contributes to the overall load of A\u03b2 plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, inhibiting sQC is a potential approach to limit the formation of pGlu-A\u03b2 and to modify the progression of AD. This study presents two novel molecules containing benzimidazole-6-carboxamide, namely LSB-09 and LSB-24, as promising sQC inhibitors. These inhibitors demonstrated moderate toxicity in human neuroblastoma cell lines and possessed IC50 values in the micromolar range (40 and 4\u00a0\u03bcM for LSB-09 and LSB-24, respectively). Additionally, the X-ray crystal structure of the sQC-LSB-09 complex revealed a unique binding mode, and a systematic computational investigation elucidated the binding mode for LSB-24. The binding mode of these two benzimidazole-6-carboxamide inhibitors offers a potential platform for designing attractive lead candidates against sQC.",

        "AbstractText": "Structural brain changes underlie cognitive changes and interindividual variability in cognition in older age. By using structural MRI data-driven clustering, we aimed to identify subgroups of cognitively unimpaired older adults based on brain change patterns and assess how changes in cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volume relate to cognitive change. We tested (1) which brain structural changes predict cognitive change (2) whether these are associated with core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, and (3) the degree of overlap between clusters derived from different structural modalities in 1899 cognitively healthy older adults followed up to 16 years. We identified four groups for each brain feature, based on the degree of a main longitudinal component of decline. The minimal overlap between features suggested that each contributed uniquely and independently to structural brain changes in aging. Cognitive change and baseline cognition were associated with cortical area change, whereas higher baseline levels of phosphorylated tau and amyloid-\u03b2 related to changes in subcortical volume. These results may contribute to a better understanding of different aging trajectories.",

        "AbstractText": "A comprehensive evaluation for cognitive impairment should culminate with the communication of the diagnosis to patients and their care partners. This diagnostic disclosure sets the stage for subsequent care. Diagnostic disclosure for individuals with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD-related dementias (ADRD) is particularly nuanced and requires a conscientious approach. Clinicians must assess patients' understanding and appreciation of symptoms, goals for the evaluation, and desire for information. Because AD/ADRD can impact patients' perceptions of their symptoms, it is recommended to include an informant or care partner for this assessment and for future care. Here, we provide guidance for addressing the complexities of AD/ADRD diagnostic disclosure to build clinicians' confidence in communicating diagnostic findings and a plan of care. HIGHLIGHTS: Diagnostic disclosure is a key part of the evaluation of cognitive impairment. The disclosure process begins at the moment a cognitive evaluation is initiated. Care partners must be included in the cognitive evaluation and diagnostic disclosure. Clinicians should use patient-centered communication for evaluation and disclosure.",

This study evaluated DTI-ALPS as a biomarker for cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) related vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). METHODS: Four independent cohorts were examined. A composite score of executive function (UDS3-EF) was used to evaluate EF status. The association between the ALPS index and UDS3-EF scores and the mediator effect of free water in white matter (WM-FW) on such association was analyzed. RESULTS: The ALPS index was significantly associated with UDS3-EF scores in all cohorts. Additionally, WM-FW mediates the relationship between the ALPS index and UDS3-EF scores. DISCUSSION: Lower ALPS index may be a surrogate marker of glymphatic dysfunction, which is associated with impaired EF, and this association is mediated by the interstitial fluid (ISF) drainage ISF in WM, providing a clinical rationale for using ALPS index as a biomarker for cSVD-related VCID. HIGHLIGHTS: This is the first study to investigate the mediation role of interstitial FW fraction (WM-FW) on the relationship between glymphatic clearance (ALPS index) and EF (UDS3-EF scores) in four independent middle to aged cohorts at risk for cSVD. This study identified that ALPS index was independently associated with UDS3-EF scores after adjusting for demographics, VRFs, and WM hyperintensity burden and that WM-FW mediated this association in all middle to aged cohorts. Our findings suggest that in middle to aged individuals, glymphatic dysfunction (reflected by ALPS index) is strongly associated with EF and that this association is mediated by the ISF drainage in WM. This study provides a strong clinical rationale for the use of the ALPS index as a marker of cognitive function in multi-site observational studies and clinical trials to monitor and prevent VCID.",

Previous studies focused on microglial amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) phagocytosis with less attention on the impact of TREM2R47H mutation on blood monocytes. METHODS: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models were used to assess the contribution of blood monocytes carrying TREM2R47H mutation to AD. RESULTS: A\u03b2 phagocytosis was compromised in mouse monocytes carrying the TREM2R47H mutation. Transplantation of bone marrow cells (BMCs) carrying TREM2R47H mutation increased cerebral A\u03b2 burden and aggravated AD-type pathologies. Moreover, the replacement of TREM2R47H-BMCs restored monocytic A\u03b2 phagocytosis, lowered A\u03b2 levels in the blood and brain, and improved cognitive function. DISCUSSION: Our study reveals that blood monocytes carrying the TREM2R47H mutation substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, and correcting the TREM2R47H mutation in BMCs would be a potential therapeutic approach for those carrying this mutation. HIGHLIGHTS: TREM2R47H mutation compromises the A\u03b2 phagocytosis of blood monocytes. Blood monocytes carrying TREM2R47H mutation contribute substantially to AD pathogenesis.

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau (tauopathy) is associated with cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, a metabolic shift due to the Warburg effect results in increased lactate production. Lactate can induce a post-translational modification (PTM) on proteins that conjugates lactyl groups to lysine (K) residues, which is known as lactylation. METHODS: We analyzed lactylation of tau in control and AD brain tissue and conducted cell-based assays. In addition, we used in vitro assays to determine whether p300 catalyzed tau lactylation. RESULTS: Quantitative proteomics detected that tau lactylation was elevated in AD brains, with K residue at position 331 (K331) being a prominent site. Lactate induced tau lactylation, which increased tau phosphorylation and cleavage and reduced ubiquitination. Inhibition of lactate production lowered tau lactylation; p300 catalyzed tau lactylation. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that tau lactylation links metabolic dysregulation with tauopathy and could serve as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target. HIGHLIGHTS: Elevated tau lactylation, particularly at K331, is evident in in human AD brain samples. Lactate induces tau lactylation, enhancing phosphorylation and cleavage while inhibiting ubiquitination. The acetyl-transferase p300 catalyzes tau lactylation, with K331 being the most prominent site.",

Small EVs, also called exosomes, are lipid-bound particles (\u224830-150\u00a0nm) that play a role in healthy and pathophysiological interactions, including intercellular communication, by transporting bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Their ability to cross biological barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier, makes them ideal candidates for targeted therapeutic interventions. In the context of chronic diseases, exosomes can be engineered to deliver active agents, including small molecules and siRNAs to specific target cells, providing a novel approach to precision medicine. Moreover, exosomes show great promise as repositories for diagnostic biomarkers. Their cargo can reflect the physiological and pathological status of the parent cells, making them valuable indicators of disease progression and response to treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of exosomes in four chronic diseases: cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, and orthopedic disease, which significantly impact global public health due to their high prevalence and associated morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, the potential of exosomes as valuable tools for theranostics and disease management is highlighted.

In this study, we examined the quality of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) that beneficiaries entered after hospital discharge under different payment models. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries who were discharged from hospitals and admitted to SNFs between 2013 and 2018. KEY MEASURES: The exposure variable was a payment indicator, including ACO, MA, or non-ACO traditional Medicare (TM) fee-for-service. The dependent variable was high overall quality SNF, defined as with at least 4-star rating in the CMS Nursing Home Care Compare. ANALYTIC PLAN: We examined the payer distribution by dementia diagnosis using ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) fixed effects and adjusted for age, gender, and race. We also estimated the probabilities of entering high-quality SNF as a function of payer status and dementia diagnosis each year using hospital and ZCTA fixed effects and accounting for beneficiary-level covariates. RESULTS: Among SNF admissions from 2013 to 2018, the share of ACO-attributed beneficiaries increased from 7.6% to 20.2%, MA enrollees increased from 25.2% to 32.8%, and non-ACO-attributed TM enrollees decreased from 67.2% to 47.3%. Consistently, ACO-attributed beneficiaries were the most likely, while MA enrollees were the least likely to enter high-quality SNFs, regardless of dementia diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight significant differences in access to high-quality SNFs across Medicare payment models, with ACO-attributed beneficiaries consistently experiencing better access than their MA or traditional Medicare counterparts, regardless of dementia diagnosis.

The current study sought to investigate the construct and diagnostic validity of the NCB among those with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Participants (n\u2009=\u200947) with and without MCI were administered the NCB and traditional cognitive tests. Three of six NCB measures assessing domains of memory, processing speed, and executive functioning demonstrated moderate to strong associations with well-established cognitive performance tests. In classifying those with and without MCI, sensitivities of these three NCB measures ranged from 0.47 to 0.74, and specificities ranged from 0.78 to 1.00. For traditional cognitive measures, sensitivities ranged from 0.74 to 0.84, and specificities ranged from 0.74 to 0.94. Overall, web-based cognitive test measures pertaining to cognitive domains of memory, processing speed, and executive functioning may serve as highly portable screening tools for detecting the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

FDG-PET elucidates glucose metabolic reductions due to altered neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex, allowing detection and identification of neurodegenerative processes. This study aims to investigate cerebral glucose metabolism in cognitively impaired elderly patients with BD using FDG-PET imaging, to elucidate potential underlying mechanisms and improve diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of FDG-PET scans from 32 cognitively impaired elderly patients with BD (mean age 70.4 years). These were compared with scans from 35 non-degenerative controls (NDC) and patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n\u2009=\u200927), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n\u2009=\u200926), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n\u2009=\u200918). Voxel-wise statistical analysis was performed using SPM software, adjusting for age and sex. RESULTS: No significant cortical hypometabolism was found in patients with BD compared to NDC. In contrast, typical patterns of hypometabolism were observed in the AD, FTD, and DLB groups. The findings suggest that late-life cognitive impairment in patients with BD is not due to a single common neurodegenerative process. CONCLUSION: The absence of abnormal cortical metabolism in cognitively impaired elderly patients with BD suggests that cognitive impairment in this population may not be driven by a common neurodegenerative pathway. Further studies using other biomarkers are needed to investigate the brain processes involved, which could lead to improved understanding and management of cognitive impairment in patients with BD.",

The aim of this study is to examine the additional value of MRI-based brain volumetry in separating patients with DLB (AD+/-) from patients with AD and controls. METHODS: We included 1518 participants from four cohorts (ADC, ADNI, PDBP and PredictND); 147 were patients with DLB (n\u2009=\u200976, DLB/AD+; n\u2009=\u200971, DLB/AD-), 668 patients with AD dementia, and 703 controls. We used an automatic segmentation tool to compute volumes of 70 brain regions, for which age, sex, and head size-dependent z-scores were calculated. We compared individual regions between the diagnostic groups and evaluated whether combining multiple regions improves differentiation. To assess the diagnostic performance, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity. RESULTS: The classifier using the combination of 70 volumetric brain regions correctly classified 60% of patients with DLB and 70% of patients with AD dementia. For DLB vs. AD, the classifier produced an AUC of 0.80 (0.77-0.83), which outperformed the best individual region, hippocampus (AUC: 0.73 [0.69-0.76], p\u2009<\u20090.01).

Links between bacterial and viral infection and AD/PD has been suggested in several studies, however, few have attempted to establish a link between fungal infection and AD/PD. In this study we adopted a nanopore-based sequencing approach to characterise the presence or absence of fungal genera in both human brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We observed the presence of small fungal burden DNA in two AD brains and a control case (extensive amyloid angiopathy). This approach would be well-placed to investigate potential links between microbial infection and neurodegenerative disease.",

        "AbstractText": "In a series of studies on blood-brain barrier transportable peptides, a soybean dipeptide, Tyr-Pro, penetrated the mouse brain parenchyma after oral intake and improved short and long memory impairment in acute Alzheimer's model mice. Here, we aimed to clarify the anti-dementia effects of this peptide administered to SAMP8 mice prior to dementia onset. At the end of the 25-week protocol in 16-week-old SAMP8 mice, Tyr-Pro (10\u2009mg/kg/day) significantly improved the reduced spatial learning ability compared with that in the control and amino acid (Tyr + Pro) groups as indicated by the results of Morris water maze tests conducted for five consecutive days. The hippocampus and cortex regions of SAMP8 harvested after the test showed lower amyloid \u00df (A\u00df) accumulation in the Tyr-Pro group than those in the control and amino acid groups. Consistent with the lower level of A\u00df, decreased expression of \u00df-secretase (BACE1) and markedly increased expression (4-times higher) of insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) were obtained compared to those in the control group. Collectively, we demonstrated that long-term daily intake of the dipeptide Tyr-Pro in SAMP8 mice may be sufficient for maintaining cognitive ability by preventing excess A\u00df accumulation through downregulated BACE1 and particularly upregulated IDE.",

A particular pathogenic role has been attributed to the aggregation-prone huntingtin exon 1 (HTTex1), generated by aberrant splicing or proteolysis, and containing the expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) segment. Unlike amyloid fibrils from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, the atomic-level structure of HTTex1 fibrils has remained unknown, limiting diagnostic and treatment efforts. We present and analyze the structure of fibrils formed by polyQ peptides and polyQ-expanded HTTex1 in vitro. Atomic-resolution perspectives are enabled by an integrative analysis and unrestrained all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations incorporating experimental data from electron microscopy (EM), solid-state NMR, and other techniques. Alongside the use of prior data, we report magic angle spinning NMR studies of glutamine residues of the polyQ fibril core and surface, distinguished via hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). Our study provides a molecular understanding of the structure of the core as well as surface of aggregated HTTex1, including the fuzzy coat and polyQ-water interface. The obtained data are discussed in context of their implications for understanding the detection of such aggregates (diagnostics) as well as known biological properties of the fibrils.",

Use of oral anticoagulant (OAC) medications offers a lower risk of dementia, but it is unclear whether differences exist between types of OAC agents. OBJECTIVE: This was a secondary analysis to explore whether the progression from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment to dementia differs between adults with AF on warfarin versus non-vitamin K inhibitor medications (NOACs) using data extracted from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center clinical case series. METHODS: Subjects with AF on OACs, having normal cognition and no stroke at baseline, and at least 1 follow-up visit were included. OAC usage was calculated based on follow-up time and reported previous OAC use. Continuation ratio models (with subject-specific random intercepts) were used to examine the association between OAC type and cognitive diagnosis controlling for cognitive diagnosis from previous visit. RESULTS: Among 1475 eligible participants, 478 reported taking warfarin (n = 396) or NOACs (n = 82) at baseline (mean age of 79 years, 51% females, 84% non-Hispanic White). The median follow-up time was 4 years (interquartile range, 2-7). About 63% continued using either warfarin or NOACs, 44% switched from warfarin to NOACs, and 2% switched from NOACs to warfarin. After adjusting for age, sex, education, race, and cardiovascular clinical comorbidities, no significant association was found between OAC type and cognitive decline ( P = .14). CONCLUSIONS: We found similar risks of cognitive decline between those on NOACs or warfarin.

METHODS: We used Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling to compare the expression of 70 proteins in neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-bearing and non-NFT-bearing neurons in hippocampal CA1, CA2, and CA4 subregions and entorhinal cortex of cases with autopsy-confirmed AD (n\u00a0=\u00a08), PART (n\u00a0=\u00a07), and CTE (n\u00a0=\u00a05). RESULTS: There were numerous subregion-specific differences related to A\u03b2 processing, autophagy/proteostasis, inflammation, gliosis, oxidative stress, neuronal/synaptic integrity, and p-tau epitopes among these different disorders. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that there are subregion-specific proteomic differences among the neurons of these disorders, which appear to be influenced to a large degree by the presence of hippocampal A\u03b2. These proteomic differences may play a role in the differing hippocampal p-tau distribution and pathogenesis of these disorders. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), possible primary age-related tauopathy (PART), definite PART, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can be differentiated based on the proteomic composition of their neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)- and non-NFT-bearing neurons. The proteome of these NFT- and non-NFT-bearing neurons is largely correlated with the presence or absence of amyloid beta (A\u03b2). Neurons in CTE and definite PART (A\u03b2-independent pathologies) share numerous proteomic similarities that distinguish them from ADNC and possible PART (A\u03b2-positive pathologies).",

METHODS: This study used a large-scale, single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human prefrontal cortex to investigate sex-dependent molecular changes in AD. Our approach combined cell type-specific and sex-specific differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment, gene regulatory network construction, and cell-cell communication analysis to identify sex-dependent changes. RESULTS: We found significant sex-specific gene expression patterns and pathway alterations in AD. Male astrocytes showed changes in cell death pathways, with RPTOR as a key regulator, while female astrocytes had alterations in Wnt signaling and cell cycle regulation. Cell-cell communication analysis uncovered sex-specific intercellular signaling patterns, with male-specific impacts on apoptosis-related signaling and female-specific alterations in Wnt and calcium signaling. DISCUSSION: This study reveals sex-dependent gene expression patterns, pathway alterations, and intercellular communication changes, suggesting the need for sex-specific approaches in AD research. HIGHLIGHTS: Single-cell transcriptomics reveals significant sex-specific molecular signatures in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Male astrocytes show enhanced modulation of apoptotic and cell death pathways in AD; female astrocytes exhibit distinct alterations in Wnt signaling and cell-cycle regulation. Sex-dimorphic changes in mitochondrial gene expression are observed in excitatory neurons, suggesting divergent energy metabolism profiles may contribute to AD sex differences. RPTOR is identified as a key regulator of male-specific changes in astrocytes, implicating the mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway in sex-dependent AD pathology.

Saliva is an emerging specimen for measuring AD biomarkers, with distinct contexts of use that could complement blood and cerebrospinal fluid and detect various analytes. An interdisciplinary, international group of AD and related dementias (ADRD) researchers convened and performed a narrative review of published studies on salivary AD biomarkers. We critically appraised the current state of the literature, examining both consistencies and discrepancies in existing pre-analytical variables and methodologies. We discussed how various pre-analytical variables could influence the detection and quantification of salivary biomarkers, showed technologies available to standardize collection procedures, and proposed a standardized pre-analytical protocol to guide future studies on salivary AD biomarker examinations. We identified potential contexts of use, gaps, and priorities and proposed future research directions.

The plasticity of parvalbumin (PV)-containing interneurons might contribute to resilience. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), that is, extracellular matrix structures around neurons, modulate PV neuron function. We hypothesize that PNNs play a role in resilience to AD. METHODS: PNN amount and morphology were determined in immunolabelled sections of the frontal cortex of control, AD and resilient subjects. Expression levels of genes related to PNNs and microglia signatures were evaluated by bulk RNA sequencing. RESULTS: The expression of the PNN-component aggrecan around PV neurons is decreased in resilient and AD subjects, whereas PNN-sugar chains are reduced only in resilient subjects. In AD, fewer presynaptic terminals on PV neurons are detected and genes related to PNN degradation are upregulated. DISCUSSION: These data show distinct PNN changes in individuals resilient to AD, which may contribute to preserved cognition despite the neuropathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Aggrecan levels are decreased in the frontal cortex of AD and resilient subjects. In resilient subjects, WFA+ PNNs are reduced around neuronal somata. In AD patients, PV neurons show disrupted WFA peridendritic staining and synaptic loss. Expression levels of PNN-degrading enzymes are higher in AD.

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: The 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD) recapitulates amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deposition and pronounced seizure susceptibility observed in patients with AD. Forty-hertz audiovisual stimulation is a noninvasive technique that entrains gamma neural oscillations and can reduce A\u03b2 pathology and modulate glial expression in AD models. We hypothesized that 40-Hz sensory stimulation would improve seizure susceptibility in 5xFAD mice and this would be associated with reduction of plaques and modulation of glial phenotypes. METHODS: 5xFAD mice and wild-type (WT) littermates received 1\u2009h/day 40-Hz audiovisual stimulation or sham (n\u2009=\u20097-11/group), beginning 2\u2009weeks before and continuing throughout amygdala kindling epileptogenesis. Postmortem analyses included A\u03b2 pathology and morphology of astrocytes and microglia. RESULTS: 5xFAD mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility to seizures compared to WT, evidenced by fewer stimulations to reach kindling endpoint (incidence rate ratio [IRR]\u2009=\u20091.46, p\u2009<\u2009.0001) and a trend to higher seizure severity (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u2009.34, p\u2009=\u2009.059). Forty-hertz stimulation reduced the behavioral severity of the first seizure (OR\u2009=\u20094.04, p\u2009=\u2009.02) and delayed epileptogenesis, increasing the number of stimulations required to reach kindling endpoint (IRR\u2009=\u2009.82, p\u2009=\u2009.01) compared to sham, regardless of genotype. 5xFAD mice receiving sensory stimulation exhibited ~50% reduction in amyloid pathology compared to sham. Furthermore, markers of astrocytes and microglia were upregulated in both genotypes receiving 40-Hz stimulation. SIGNIFICANCE: Forty-hertz sensory entrainment slows epileptogenesis in the mouse amygdala kindling model. Although this intervention improves A\u03b2 pathology in 5xFAD mice, the observed antiepileptogenic effect may also relate to effects on glia, because mice without A\u03b2 plaques (i.e., WT) also experienced antiepileptogenic effects of the intervention.",

We quantify the association between AD polygenic risk score (AD-PRS) and WMHV, exploring single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are proximal to genes overexpressed in cerebrovascular cell species. METHODS: In a UK-Biobank sub-sample (mean age\u00a0=\u00a064, range\u00a0=\u00a045-81 years), we associate WMHV with (1) AD-PRS estimated via SNPs across the genome (minus apolipoprotein E [APOE] locus) and (2) AD-PRS estimated with SNPs proximal to specific genes that are overexpressed in cerebrovascular cell species. RESULTS: We observed a positive association between non-APOE-AD-PRS and WMHVs. We further demonstrate an association between WMHVs and AD-PRS constructed with SNPs that are proximal to genes over-represented in smooth muscles cells (SMCs; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.135, PFWE \u00a0<\u00a00.01) and internally replicated (PDISCOVERY+REPLICATION\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54, link to increased white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV). WMHVs indicate vascular risk and neurovascular injury in AD. The broader genetic link between AD risk and WMHV is not fully understood.

However, many approaches analyze single measures averaged over regions of interest without considering the underlying fiber geometry. METHODS: We propose a novel macrostructure-informed normative tractometry (MINT) framework to investigate how white matter (WM) microstructure and macrostructure are jointly altered in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. We compared MINT-derived metrics with univariate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics to examine how fiber geometry may impact the interpretation of microstructure. RESULTS: In two multisite cohorts from North America and India, we find consistent patterns of microstructural and macrostructural anomalies implicated in MCI and dementia; we also rank diffusion metrics' sensitivity to dementia. DISCUSSION: We show that MINT, by jointly modeling tract shape and microstructure, has the potential to disentangle and better interpret the effects of degenerative disease on the brain's neural pathways. HIGHLIGHTS: Changes in diffusion tensor imaging metrics may be due to macroscopic changes. Normative models encode normal variability of diffusion metrics in healthy controls. Variational autoencoder applied on tractography can learn patterns of fiber geometry. WM microstructure and macrostructure are modeled with multivariate methods.

Time spent in each room and out-of-home across the day was derived and used as the measure of life-space mobility. Participants reported via weekly questionnaires whether they felt lonely. In annual visits, the UCLA loneliness scale was administered to a subsample (n\u2009=\u200971), and the scores were categorized into high, moderate, and low groups. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to correlate life-space mobility with weekly and yearly loneliness. Repeated observations from each individual were bootstrapped for 1000 rounds to associate annual and weekly loneliness measures. RESULTS: We analyzed 4995\u2009weeks of data from 139 participants (age\u2009=\u200978.1\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6, 74% female, 23% African Americans, 14% with MCI diagnosis).

This study proposes the first artificial intelligence framework for characterizing multiple ion channel kinetics of whole-cell recordings. The framework integrates machine learning for anomaly detection and deep learning for multi-class classification. The anomaly detection excludes recordings that are incompatible with ion channel behavior. The multi-class classification combined a 1D convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention mechanism to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of the recordings. The framework achieves an accuracy of 97.58% in classifying 124 test datasets into six categories based on ion channel kinetics. The utility of the novel framework is demonstrated in two applications: Alzheimer's disease drug screening and nanomatrix-induced neuronal differentiation. In drug screening, the framework illustrates the inhibitory effects of memantine on endogenous channels, and antagonistic interactions among potassium, magnesium, and calcium ion channels. For nanomatrix-induced differentiation, the classifier indicates the effects of differentiation conditions on sodium and potassium channels associated with action potentials, validating the functional properties of differentiated neurons for Parkinson's disease treatment.

        "AbstractText": "Our review study addresses the issue of tooth loss, which is caused by loss of\u00a0masticatory function and its impact on cognitive functions, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Numerous studies have confirmed a positive correlation between premature tooth loss, reduction in masticatory function and significant cognitive decline observed through learning disabilities, including overcoming ordinary life problems to early and advanced forms of dementia. Reduced numbers of teeth in the main food processing area, i.e., loss of large molars, have been implicated as a possible cause of cognitive impairment. In research in this area, some groups of major etiopathogenetic causes of this issue have also been established. A significant etiopathogenetic cause of tooth loss is the disappearance of their mechanoreceptors in the periodontium, causing the disappearance of sensorimotor excitation via the cranial nerve V and the associated atrophic changes in the trigeminal brain nuclei and their branching in the Locus Coeruleus area. It may cause further neurodegenerative involvement in this area, one of the centers of the adrenergic system involved in cognitive function. Relatively well-studied factors are the lack of blood supply to the cerebral area during inadequate mastication caused by loss of molars and the consequent hypoxia of brain and nerve structures. In the research and development of Alzheimer's disease, there have been many recent references to the fact that the primary bacterium causing periodontitis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, can infect the neurons of the cranial nerve V ending close to the Locus Coeruleus and thus tau proteins, after tooth extractions, can spread to other subcortical nuclei in the brain. These findings are of great relevance to clinical practice in dentistry as we strive to prevent tooth loss in the distal compartment, which is made possible by the tremendous expansion of endodontic techniques and technologies to save de facto every tooth and its periodontium with the mechanoreceptors necessary to preserve sensorimotor nerve excitability and sensorimotor nerve networks. We uncompromisingly eliminate every periodontal infection in the subgingival region as part of our preventive-therapeutical procedures.",

Hip fracture patients (n = 491) with a median (25, 75 percentiles) age of 83 (74, 88) years and 69% females were enrolled at Oslo University Hospital, Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Akershus University Hospital and B\u00e6rum Hospital.

The current study examined the intervention efficacy on participants' weekly time spent out-of-home and their social interaction with family and friends. METHODS: The intervention group engaged in frequent conversations with trained interviewers via the Internet. Both intervention and control group participants received 10-min weekly phone check-in calls over 48\u202fweeks, during which they were asked to self-report their time (in hours) spent out of home and whether they had contacted family or friends during this week (yes/no). Linear mixed-effect models for repeated measures were run for time spent out-of-home, and mixed-effect models with a logistic link for contact with family and friends. The intervention effect was modeled by including an interaction term of time (measured in weeks) and group assignments (intervention vs. control). We ran subgroup analyses for participants with normal cognition (NC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). All models controlled for age, sex, race, education, and the historical event of COVID-19.

Among the participants with NC, the intervention group had a steeper increase in their time spent out-of-home (p\u202f=\u202f0.016) compared with the control group. Among the participants with MCI, the intervention group had an increased likelihood of contacting friends over time (p\u202f=\u202f0.001) than the control group. The intervention effect on contact with family was not significant for either the NC or MCI group. DISCUSSION: The I-CONECT intervention enhanced social activities among socially isolated older old participants, which could provide additional cognitive stimulation and prevent cognitive decline.",

        "AbstractText": "Cognitive function in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates to olfactory performance. Aging and disease progression both show marked olfactory deficits in humans and rodents. As a clear understanding of what causes olfactory deficits is still missing, research on this topic is paramount to diagnostics and early intervention therapy. A recent development of this research is focusing on GABAergic interneurons. Both aging and AD show a change in excitation/inhibition balance, indicating reduced inhibitory network functions. In the olfactory system, inhibition has an especially prominent role in processing information, as the olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay station of olfactory information in the brain, contains an unusually high number of inhibitory interneurons. This review summarizes the current knowledge on inhibitory interneurons at the level of the OB and the primary olfactory cortices to gain an overview of how these neurons might influence olfactory behavior. We also compare changes in interneuron composition in different olfactory brain areas between healthy aging and AD as the most common neurodegenerative disease. We find that pathophysiological changes in olfactory areas mirror findings from hippocampal and cortical regions that describe a marked cell loss for GABAergic interneurons in AD but not aging. Rather than differences in brain areas, differences in vulnerability were shown for different interneuron populations through all olfactory regions, with somatostatin-positive cells most strongly affected.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative ailment that is becoming increasingly common, making it a major worldwide health concern. Effective care depends on an early and correct diagnosis, but traditional diagnostic techniques are frequently constrained by subjectivity and expensive costs. This study proposes a novel Vision Transformer-equipped Convolutional Neural Networks (VECNN) that uses three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging to improve diagnosis accuracy. Utilizing the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, which comprised 2,248 3D MRI images and diverse patient demographics, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 92.14%, a precision of 86.84%, a sensitivity of 93.27%, and a specificity of 89.95% in distinguishing between AD, healthy controls (HC), and moderate cognitive impairment (MCI). The findings suggest that VECNN can be a valuable tool in clinical settings, providing a non-invasive, cost-effective, and objective diagnostic technique. This research opens the door for future advancements in early diagnosis and personalized therapy for Alzheimer's Disease.",

Effective care management for PwPD involves monitoring symptoms at home, involving specialised multidisciplinary care providers and enhancing self-management skills. This study protocol describes the process evaluation within a randomised clinical trial to assess the implementation and its impact on patient health outcomes of ParkProReakt-a proactive, multidisciplinary, digitally supported care model for community-dwelling PwPD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The hybrid efficacy-implementation study will assess key implementation outcomes using the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions alongside a randomised controlled trial. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to assess process data from care providers and patients. The main process outcomes are fidelity, dose, feasibility and context. Context will be analysed through semistructured interviews and focus groups using the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research. To elucidate potential facilitators and barriers to implementation and to gain deeper insights into the efficacy outcome data, quantitative and qualitative process data will be integrated at an interpretative level using mixed methods. In addition to process evaluation, potential indirect mechanisms of impact will be measured.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: As a non drug and non invasive therapy, both transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may modulate cortical rhythms and serve as potentially effective approaches to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, studies using animal models of AD are quite limited. METHODS: This study investigates the aftereffects of tACS and tDCS on brain EEG activity and associated exploratory behavior in normal aged and APP/PS1 transgenic mice (15\u202fmonths old). Anodal tDCS and 10\u202fHz tACS (350\u202f\u03bcA, 20\u202fmin) were applied once and EEGs were recorded from the hippocampus (Hip) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) during spontaneous home-cage state and open-field exploration. RESULTS: A key finding was that tDCS induced significant alpha (8-12\u202fHz) EEG changes while tACS induced peak frequency changes in the group difference between normal aged and AD mice. However, both groups showed similar increases in theta (4-8\u202fHz) EEG activity during open-field exploration and increases in gamma (20-100\u202fHz) EEG activity in spontaneous state, suggesting that the ongoing physiological state may be related to some of the EEG changes. CONCLUSION: This study provides insight into the short-term aftereffects of transcranial current stimulation in the aging and AD brain and is the first animal study to compare brain activity between tACS and tDCS treatments.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and impaired reasoning. It is the leading cause of dementia in older adults, marked by the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological changes lead to widespread neuronal damage, significantly impacting daily functioning and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This comprehensive review aims to explore various aspects of Alzheimer's disease, including its epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnostic advancements, management strategies, caregiving challenges, and emerging therapeutic interventions. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus, from their inception to May 2024. The search strategy incorporated a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms such as \"Alzheimer's disease,\" \"epidemiology,\" \"risk factors,\" \"symptoms,\" \"diagnosis,\" \"management,\" \"caregiving,\" \"treatment,\" and \"novel therapies.\" Boolean operators (AND, OR) were used to refine the search, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature on Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: AD is significantly influenced by genetic predispositions, such as the apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele, along with modifiable environmental factors like diet, physical activity, and cognitive engagement. Diagnostic approaches have evolved with advances in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, PET), and biomarker analysis, allowing for earlier detection and intervention. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association have updated diagnostic criteria to include biomarker data, enhancing early diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The management of AD includes pharmacological treatments, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, which provide symptomatic relief but do not slow disease progression. Emerging therapies, including amyloid-beta and tau-targeting treatments, gene therapy, and immunotherapy, offer potential for disease modification. The critical role of caregivers is underscored, as they face considerable emotional, physical, and financial burdens. Support programs, communication strategies, and educational interventions are essential for improving caregiving outcomes. While significant advancements have been made in understanding and managing AD, ongoing research is necessary to identify new therapeutic targets and enhance diagnostic and treatment strategies. A holistic approach, integrating clinical, genetic, and environmental factors, is essential for addressing the multifaceted challenges of Alzheimer's disease and improving outcomes for both patients and caregivers.",

        "AbstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of the brain, manifesting itself with both motor and non-motor symptoms. A critical element of this pathology is neuroinflammation, which triggers a harmful neurotoxic cycle, exacerbating cell death within the central nervous system. AD-16 (also known as GIBH-130) is a recently identified compound capable of reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in Alzheimer's disease models. Here, for the first time, we sought to comprehend the potential impact of orally administered AD-16 in mitigating neurodegeneration and subsequent disease progression in PD. To accomplish this, 6- hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilateral striatal injections were employed to induce a PD model in male C57BL/6 mice. Cylinder and apomorphine-induced rotation behavior tests were conducted to assess motor behavior and validate the PD model 3 days after the injection. AD-16 was administered via gavage daily between days 3 and 9 after surgery. On the last day of treatment, motor tests were performed again. All animals were euthanized on day 10 and immunohistochemistry techniques were performed to detect tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Iba-1 and thus label dopaminergic neurons and microglia in the SNc and striatum (CPu). These same regions were collected for ELISA assays to assess different cytokine concentrations. Our results revealed an enhancement in the motor function of the AD-16-treated animals, as well as reduced nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. In addition, AD-16 reduced the increase in microglia density and prevented the changes in its morphology observed in the PD animal models. Furthermore, AD-16 was able to avoid the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines levels that were present in 6-OHDA-injected animals who received vehicle. Consequently, AD-16 emerges as a compound with significant potential for negative modulation of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation suppression in the 6-OHDA animal model of Parkinson's disease.",

Nevertheless, advancements in understanding AD's diverse pathobiology suggest the potential for establishing blood-based methods for differential diagnosis. METHODS: We devised a novel assay combining immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to quantify Amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides in plasma. We then assessed its performance against existing assays (Shimadzu and Simoa) and evaluated a range of other blood-based biomarkers, including GFAP, NfL, and pTau-181, for differentiating between AD and bvFTD. RESULTS: The novel IP-MS assay measuring the A\u03b242/40 ratio demonstrated an AUC of 0.82 for differentiating AD from control subjects. While it did not significantly outperform the composite biomarker score from the Shimadzu assay (AUC\u2009=\u20090.79, P\u2009=\u20090.67), it significantly outperformed the Shimadzu A\u03b242/40 ratio (AUC\u2009=\u20090.65, P\u2009=\u20090.037) and the Simoa A\u03b242/40 assay (AUC\u2009=\u20090.57, P\u2009=\u20090.023). A\u03b2 biomarkers provided limited utility in distinguishing AD from bvFTD. In contrast, pTau181 and GFAP exhibited strong discriminatory power for differentiating AD from bvFTD, with AUCs of 0.90 and 0.87, respectively. Combining pTau181 and GFAP enhanced diagnostic accuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.94. CONCLUSION: We introduced a novel IP-MS assay that demonstrated comparable precision to the Shimadzu composite score in differentiating AD from non-neurodegenerative control groups. However, A\u03b2 levels did not enhance the discrimination between AD and bvFTD. Furthermore, our findings support the utility of combining pTau181 and GFAP as a robust strategy for the blood-based differentiation of AD and bvFTD.",

We delve into TDP-43's crucial functions in RNA metabolism, including splicing regulation, mRNA stability, and miRNA biogenesis. Particular emphasis is placed on recent discoveries regarding TDP-43's involvement in DNA interactions and chromatin dynamics, highlighting its broader impact on gene expression and genome stability. The review also examines the complex pathogenesis of TDP-43-related disorders, discussing the protein's propensity for aggregation, its effects on mitochondrial function, and its non-cell autonomous impacts on glial cells. We provide an in-depth analysis of TDP-43 pathology across various neurodegenerative conditions, from well-established associations in ALS and FTLD to emerging roles in diseases such as Huntington's disease and Niemann-Pick C disease. The potential of TDP-43 as a therapeutic target is explored, with a focus on recent developments in targeting cryptic exon inclusion and other TDP-43-mediated processes.

Here, we examined sex-specific associations between circadian rest-activity patterns and AD-related pathophysiological processes across the adult lifespan. METHODS: Ninety-two cognitively unimpaired adults (mean age\u2009=\u200959.85\u2009\u00b1\u200913.77 years, range\u2009=\u200930-85, 47 females) underwent 10 days of actigraphic recordings, and blood drawing. Standard non-parametric indices of 24-h rest-activity rhythm fragmentation (intradaily variability, IV) and stability (interdaily stability, IS) were extracted from actigraphy data using the GGIR package. Plasma concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), amyloid-\u03b242/40 (A\u03b242/40), total tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) or threonine 231 (p-tau231) were measured using Single molecule array technology. Multiple linear regression models were adjusted for age, sex, education, body mass index, and actigraphic recording duration. RESULTS: Higher IV, indicating worse 24-h rest-activity rhythm fragmentation, was associated with elevated levels of plasma NfL (t(85)\u2009=\u20094.26, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), GFAP (t(85)\u2009=\u20092.49, P\u2009=\u20090.01), and at trend level with lower A\u03b242/40 ratio values (t(85)\u00a0=\u00a0-1.95, P\u2009=\u20090.054). Lower IS, reflecting less day-to-day stability in the 24-h rest-activity rhythm, was linked to elevated levels of plasma NfL (t(85)\u00a0=\u00a0-2.24, P\u2009=\u20090.03), but not with the other plasma biomarkers. Importantly, interaction models demonstrated that male participants were driving the observed relationships between IV and plasma NfL (t(84)\u2009=\u20094.05, P\u2009<\u20090.001) or GFAP (t(84)\u2009=\u20093.60, P\u2009<\u20090.001), but also revealed a male vulnerability in models testing interactions with p-tau181 (IV: t(76)\u2009=\u20093.71, P\u2009<\u20090.001; IS: t(76)\u00a0=\u00a0-3.30, P\u2009=\u20090.001) and p-tau231 (IV: t(82)\u2009=\u20093.28, P\u2009=\u20090.002). Sensitivity analyses further showed that accounting for potential confounding factors such as APOE genotype, depression, and self-reported symptoms of possible sleep apnea did not modify the observed relationships. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the association between disrupted circadian rest-activity patterns and AD pathophysiological processes may be more evident in cognitively unimpaired males. Our results contribute to the precision medicine approach, and they have clinical implications for improved early detection and selection of at-risk individuals to be enrolled in preventive interventions.",

Early detection of high-risk dementia patients and timely intervention or treatment are of significant clinical importance. Neural network survival analysis represents the most advanced technology for survival analysis to date. However, there is a lack of deep learning-based survival analysis models that integrate both genetic and clinical factors to develop and validate individualized dynamic dementia risk prediction models. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study is based on a large prospective cohort from the UK Biobank, which includes a total of 41,484 participants with an average follow-up period of 12.6\u00a0years. Initially, 364 candidate features (predictor variables) were screened. The top 30 key features were then identified by ranking the importance of each predictor variable using the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model. A multi-model comparison strategy was employed to evaluate the predictive performance of four survival analysis models: DeepSurv, DeepHit, Kaplan-Meier estimation, and the Cox proportional hazards model (CoxPH). The results showed that the average Harrell's C-index for the DeepSurv model was 0.743, for the DeepHit model it was 0.633, for the CoxPH model it was 0.749, and for the Kaplan-Meier estimator model it was 0.500. In addition, the average D-Calibration Survival Measure was 6.014, 4408.086, 32274.743, and 1.508, respectively. The Brier score (BS) was used to assess the importance of features for the DeepSurv dementia prediction model, and the relationship between features and dementia was visualized using a partial dependence plot (PDP). To facilitate further research, the team deployed the DeepSurv dementia prediction model on AliCloud servers and designated it as the UKB-DementiaPre Tool. CONCLUSION: This study successfully developed and validated the DeepSurv dementia prediction model for individuals aged 60\u00a0years and above, integrating both genetic and clinical data. The model was then deployed on AliCloud servers to promote its clinical translation. It is anticipated that this prediction model will provide more accurate decision support for clinical treatment and will serve as a valuable tool for the primary prevention of dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and leading to cellular senescence and cognitive deficits. Cellular senescence contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of AD through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), exacerbating A\u03b2 deposition. This study investigates the protective effects of 3-N-Butylphthalide (NBP), a compound derived from Apium graveolens Linn (Chinese celery), on A\u03b2-induced cellular senescence in U87 cells. Using RNA-sequencing and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that NBP ameliorate A\u03b2 oligomer-induced cellular senescence and apoptosis, and regulated the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and components of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)- phosphorylated retinoblastoma 1 (pRB1)-Caspase3 pathway. Moreover, NBP was shown to suppress the expression of SASP-related genes. These findings suggest that NBP rescues U87 cells from A\u03b2 oligomer-induced senescence and apoptosis through modulating the CDK2-pRB1-Caspase3 axis and SASP expression. Our results underscore the potential of NBP as a senostatic agent for AD which have not been reported in previous studies, offering insights into its mechanisms of action and paving the way for future studies on its efficacy in vivo and in clinical settings. Thus, we contribute to growing evidence supporting the use of senolytic and senostatic agents in the treatment of AD.",

OBJECT: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Fuzhisan(FZS) on autophagic function in Alzheimer's disease and to elucidate its potential mechanism through the P62 regulatory pathways. METHODS: FZS was extracted by water extraction-rotary evaporation method. The novel object recognition test, morris water maze test and Y maze test were used to observe the cognitive and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. The effects of FZS on the ultrastructure of mice hippocampus were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Molecular level changes were also further detected, including A\u03b2 deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, SOD, CAT and autophagy related proteins (p62, Nrf2, keap1, mTOR, LC3II/I, Beclin1, Atgs). RESULTS: FZS could alleviate memory and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice, increase the autophagic vesicles and organelle abundance in hippocampus. FZS also reduced the levels of A\u03b2 and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus of model mice, upregulated the levels of SOD, CAT and autophagy related proteins (Nrf2, LC3II/LC3I, Beclin1, Atg7 and Atg12) as well as downregulated the expression of P62, keap1 and p-mTOR/mTOR proteins. Co-Ip results showed that FZS elevated the levels of p62/LC3 and P62-keap1-Nrf2 complex, but decreased the P62 and keap1 association. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that FZS may affect autophagy function and oxidative stress by regulating P62 and related pathways to promote the clearance of A\u03b2 and phosphorylated tau, thereby improving the cognitive ability of AD, which provided a novel perspective for exploring the potential mechanism of FZS upon AD.",

AIMS: To highlight the prevalence of CMBs in an Australian memory clinic cohort and explore associations with diagnoses, topography and cognitive performance. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 393 patients who attended a memory clinic (CDAMS) in Melbourne, Australia from January 2014 to December 2016 who underwent brain MRI. Data collected included age, gender, clinical diagnosis and cognitive scores. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify associations of CMBs with clinical and cognitive findings. RESULTS: The prevalence of CMBs was 27% (n=107) with good inter-rater reliability (\u03ba=0.75). CMBs were significantly associated with increasing age. Prevalence of CMBs was higher in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (32%) and dementia (39%) compared with other diagnostic groups (p<0.001). Lobar-predominant CMB distribution was associated with AD diagnosis. Presence of multiple CMBs was associated with poorer cognitive performance overall.

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the relative contribution of frontal and anterior temporal lobes in semantic knowledge of social norms in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Therefore, this study examined performance of FTD patients with either frontal (F-FTD, left temporal (LT-FTD) or bitemporal lobe atrophy (BT-FTD) on the Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ) and explored what accounts for the variance in the SNQ-break norm subscale (i.e., endorsement of inappropriate behaviors). METHODS: Using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), groups were matched for age and education and included (a) 24\u2009F-FTD patients, (b) 15 LT-FTD patients, (c) 17 BT-FTD patients, and (d) 188 older controls with normal cognition (NC). RESULTS: The BT-FTD group had significantly higher SNQ break norm score than F-FTD and NC groups with a medium effect size, which was also positively associated with the severity personality changes in the real world. Interestingly, the F-FTD and LT-FTD groups performed similarly to the NC group. Regression analysis showed that approximately 21.2% of the variance in SNQ break norms subscale score performance was explained by performance on verb naming. CONCLUSIONS: Social inappropriateness in FTD may partially arise from a deficit in knowledge of normative behavior.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: K48-linked ubiquitin chain (Ub-K48) is a crucial ubiquitin chain implicated in protein degradation within the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, the precise function and molecular mechanism underlying the role of Ub-K48 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neuronal cell abnormalities remain unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the function of K48 ubiquitination in the etiology of AD, and its associated mechanism of neuronal apoptosis. METHODS: A mouse model of AD was constructed, and behavioral phenotypic changes were detected using an open field test (OFT). The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an early marker of AD, was detected by western blotting (WB). Neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal region was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Nissl staining. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed to observe the changes in Phosphorylated tubulin associated unit (p-Tau) and Ub-K48 colocalization in neurons of the hippocampal region of AD mice. WB was further applied to detect the degree of ubiquitylation of K48 and the expression of Tau, p-Tau, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) proteins in neuronal cells of the hippocampus and cortical regions of mice. RESULTS: Mice with AD exhibited significantly longer resting times (p < 0.05) and shorter average speeds (p < 0.01), total distances travelled (p < 0.01), and distances travelled (p < 0.01) in the central region than those in the control group. This indicated cognitive impairment, which occurred concurrent with an increased expression of the AD marker GFAP protein (p < 0.001). The hippocampal region of AD mice showed abnormalities with sparsely and irregularly arranged cells, large gaps between cells, lighter staining, unclear boundaries of the cell membranes and nuclei, and agglutinated and condensed nuclei (p < 0.01). The neuronal cells of AD mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of p-Tau (p < 0.01) and Ub-K48 (p < 0.01), as well as a notable degree of co-localization within the cells. The intracellular pro-inflammatory protein Bax was significantly upregulated (p < 0.05), while the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05), thus inducing apoptosis in AD neuronal cells. CONCLUSION: Ub-K48 is strongly linked to the development of AD. p-Tau aggregate in neuronal cells in the hippocampal region of the AD brain and colocalize with Ub-K48, which in turn leads to cellular inflammation and the induction of apoptosis in neuronal cells.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The relationship between subregion atrophy in the entire temporal lobe and subcortical nuclei and cognitive decline at various stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. METHODS: We selected 711 participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which included 195 cases of cognitively normal (CN), 271 cases of early Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (EMCI), 132 cases of late MCI (LMCI), and 113 cases of AD. we looked at how subregion atrophy in the temporal lobe and subcortical nuclei correlated with cognition at different stages of AD. The volume of the subregions was measured from the human Brainnetome atlas (BNA-246) using voxel-based morphometry and discriminant and correlation analyses were performed. RESULTS: Only the left premotor thalamus demonstrated significant shrinkage in individuals with EMCI (p = 0.012). Discriminant analysis revealed that the left rostral Brodmann area 20 has the highest discriminatory ability among all temporal subregions to distinguish patients with AD from CN. While the left caudal hippocampus can efficiently distinguish patients with LMCI from EMCI. While the right rostral Brodmann area 20 was the most effective in distinguishing AD from LMCI. Correlation analysis revealed that the left nucleus accumbens, left caudal area 35/36, and left sensory thalamus had a mild correlation with cognitive scores measured using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-cog) 13 and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the right rostral area 20 in the inferior temporal gyrus plays a significant role in cognitive impairment in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurological disorder, is one of the major reasons for memory loss in the world. AD is characterized by a sequela of cognitive and functional decline caused by brain cell degeneration. Paeoniflorin is a monoterpenoid glycoside found in plants of the Paeoniaceae family, which are known for their medicinal properties including dementia. In this project, we report actions of paeoniflorin on the two related cholinesterases (ChE): acetylChE (AChE) and butyrylChE (BuChE). Paeoniflorin, in a dose-dependent (maximum inhibition at 1\u2009mg/mL) manner, inhibited both AChE (0.06-1\u2009mg/mL) and BuChE (0.007-1\u2009mg/mL) enzymes with maximum inhibition of AChE enzyme at 90.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4%, while 99.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3% for BuChE enzyme. The EC50 value for the inhibitory effect of the compound against AChE was 0.52\u2009mg/mL (0.18-1.52), while against BuChE was 0.13\u2009mg/mL (0.08-0.21). The observed ani-ChE action was like an effect also mediated by the known ChE blocker physostigmine. Molecular interactions between paeoniflorin and both ChE enzymes were additionally sought via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations for 100\u2009ns, that showed paeoniflorin interacted with the active-site gorge of AChE and BuChE via hydrogen bonds and water bridging with the many amino acids of the AChE and BuChE enzymes. This study presents the ChE inhibitory potential of paeoniflorin against both AChE and BuChE enzymes. With this kind of inhibitory activity, the chemical can potentially increase ACh levels and may have use in the treatment of dementia of AD.",

It is an intricate network of synergistic molecular pathways that exert their effects far beyond their local vicinity and even affect the systemic functioning of the body. The current review explores the involvement of the gut-brain axis (GBA) in the functioning of the nervous system, with a special emphasis on the neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, and neuroinflammation that occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Gut-derived microbial metabolites play an important role in facilitating this interaction. We also highlighted the complex interaction between gut-derived metabolites and CNS processes, demonstrating how microbial dysbiosis might result in clinical disorders. Short-chain fatty acids have neuroprotective properties, whereas branched-chain amino acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), and tryptophan derivatives such as indole have negative effects at high concentrations. Furthermore, we cover pharmaceutical and nonpharmacological approaches for restoring the gut microbial balance and promoting neurological health. We further expanded on nutritional therapies and lifestyle changes, such as the Mediterranean diet and exercise. Next, we focused on food-controlling habits such as caloric restriction and intermittent fasting. Moreover, interventional techniques such as prebiotics, probiotics, and pharmacological medications have also been utilized to modify the GBA. Historical microbiome research from early discoveries to recent studies linking gut health to cognitive and emotional well-being has increased our understanding of the GBA.",

        "AbstractText": "Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high-temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a methodology to overcome these problems called filter average short-term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, a long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of visual short-term memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyze the transient high-temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy event-related potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyze an activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.",

        "AbstractText": "Hub regions in the brain, recognized for their roles in ensuring efficient information transfer, are vulnerable to pathological alterations in neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Computational simulations and animal experiments have hinted at the theory of activity-dependent degeneration as the cause of this hub vulnerability. However, two critical issues remain unresolved. First, past research has not clearly distinguished between two scenarios: hub regions facing a higher risk of connectivity disruption (targeted attack) and all regions having an equal risk (random attack). Second, human studies offering support for activity-dependent explanations remain scarce. We refined the hub disruption index to demonstrate a hub disruption pattern in functional connectivity in autosomal dominant AD that aligned with targeted attacks. This hub disruption is detectable even in preclinical stages, 12 years before the expected symptom onset and is amplified alongside symptomatic progression. Moreover, hub disruption was primarily tied to regional differences in global connectivity and sequentially followed changes observed in amyloid-beta positron emission tomography cortical markers, consistent with the activity-dependent degeneration explanation. Taken together, our findings deepen the understanding of brain network organization in neurodegenerative diseases and could be instrumental in refining diagnostic and targeted therapeutic strategies for AD in the future.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurological disorders encompass a complex and heterogeneous spectrum of diseases affecting the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system, each presenting unique challenges that extend well beyond primary neurological symptoms. These disorders profoundly impact cardiovascular health, prompting an intensified exploration into the intricate interconnections between the neurological and cardiovascular systems. This review synthesizes current insights and research on cardiovascular comorbidities associated with major neurological conditions, including stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. The cardiovascular sequelae of these neurological disorders are multifactorial. For instance, strokes not only predispose individuals to arrhythmia and heart failure but also exacerbate preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Similarly, epilepsy is associated with autonomic dysregulation and an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death, underscoring the necessity for vigilant cardiac monitoring in affected individuals. Parkinson's disease manifests with orthostatic hypotension and cardiac sympathetic denervation, significantly contributing to morbidity. Additionally, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease exhibit cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and heightened cardiovascular risk, underscoring the need for proactive management strategies. Mechanistically, these conditions disrupt autonomic nervous system regulation, induce chronic inflammation, and may share genetic susceptibilities, each contributing to cardiovascular pathology. Effective management of these complexities requires an integrative approach that includes risk factor modification, pharmacotherapy, lifestyle interventions, and comprehensive patient education. Future research directions include identifying novel therapeutic targets, conducting large-scale clinical trials, and investigating genetic biomarkers to individualize treatment strategies. By addressing the multifaceted interactions between neurological disorders and cardiovascular health, healthcare providers can optimize patient care, reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.",

        "AbstractText": "SIGNIFICANCE: The eye can be used as a potential monitoring window for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of neurological diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) are common causes of cognitive impairment and may share many similarities in ocular signs. Multimodal ophthalmic imaging is a technology to quantify pupillary light reaction, retinal reflectance spectrum, and hemodynamics. This provides multidimensional ocular metrics from a non-invasive approach to ocular biomarkers and differential diagnosis of AD and VCI. AIM: We aim to investigate the changing pattern of ocular metrics in patients with AD and VCI using multimodal ophthalmic imaging. APPROACH: Patients with subjective cognitive complaints in the memory clinic were subdivided into AD, VCI, and cognitively healthy individuals using neuropsychological and neuroimaging examinations, including positron emission tomography. All subjects underwent a medical history review, blood pressure measurement, medical optometry, intraocular pressure measurement, and custom-built multimodal ophthalmic imaging. Multidimensional parameters were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc comparisons. RESULTS: This study included 19 patients with AD, 24 patients with VCI, and 37 cognitively healthy age- and sex-matched subjects. Both AD and VCI patients showed abnormal pupillary light reactions, including decreased resting pupil diameter, pupil constriction amplitude, and maximum constriction velocity. Compared with the control group, the AD group presented increased retinal reflectance at 548\u00a0nm, whereas the VCI group presented an increased resistivity index and decreased blowout score in retinal hemodynamics. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that pupillary light reaction-related neurodegeneration is the common pathological change in both AD and VCI. In addition, AD is characterized by alterations in retinal spectral signatures, whereas VCI is characterized by alterations in retinal hemodynamics. These findings suggest that multimodal ophthalmic imaging may have the potential to be used as a screening tool for detecting AD and VCI.",

This study aimed to investigate whether AD patients with sleep disorders exhibit worse glymphatic function and more severe cognitive impairment compared to those without sleep disorders and to explore the underlying molecular imaging mechanisms. METHODS: This study included 40 AD patients with sleep disorders (ADSD), 39 cognitively matched AD patients without sleep disorders (ADNSD), and 25\u00a0healthy middle-aged and elderly controls (NC). Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and cognitive and sleep assessments. The ALPS (Along the Perivascular Space) index was calculated, followed by intergroup comparisons, correlation analyses, and mediation analyses. The diagnostic utility of the ALPS index was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The ALPS index was lower in the ADNSD and ADSD groups compared to the NC group. In the ADSD group, PSQI scores were negatively correlated with MMSE scores. The ALPS index was positively correlated with MMSE scores and negatively with PSQI scores. Mediation analyses indicated that the ALPS index partially mediated the effect of sleep disturbances on cognitive impairment (indirect effect = -0.134; mediation effect = 30.505%). The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for distinguishing ADSD from ADNSD was 0.86, with a cutoff ALPS index value 1.309. CONCLUSION: Sleep disorders worsen glymphatic function and cognitive impairment in AD patients. The ALPS index partially mediates the impact of sleep disorders on cognitive function and shows moderate accuracy in distinguishing between patients with ADSD and ADNSD.",

Using data from cognitively unimpaired community-dwelling older adults (N\u00a0=\u00a068), cluster analysis was used to characterise sleep discrepancy (for total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE)), and logistic regression was used to explore sleep discrepancy's associations with brain glucose metabolism, while controlling for insomnia severity and depressive symptoms.

The relationship between Andro's anti-AD mechanism and the regulation of miR-222 was discussed in this study. Andro protected against cytotoxicity induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or amyloid-\u03b2, accompanied by upregulating p62 and Nrf2 mRNA and protein, downregulating TLR4 and NF-\u03baBp65 mRNA and protein, and increasing LC3\u2161 protein in vitro. miRNA and mRNA sequencing results showed that Andro downregulated miR-222 and upregulated sqstm1/p62.

No any detailed research concerning the binding behavior of BChE with small molecule. As the first case, the inhibitory mechanism of vasicine on BChE was investigated using multi-spectroscopic methods (including fluorescence quenching, ANS fluorescence probe, three-dimensional fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence, circular dichroism), isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, and computational approaches. As a reversible and mixed inhibitor, vasicine displayed moderate affinity for BChE with an affinity constant KD of 2.111\u00a0\u03bcM, its binding process was characterized as a spontaneous exothermic reaction with reduced entropy, primarily driven by hydrogen bonding interactions. Vasicine quenched the fluorescence of BChE through both static and dynamic quenching mechanisms, leading to an increase in the \u03b1-helix content and surface hydrophobicity of BChE. Furthermore, the fluctuation of the skeleton atoms in the vasicine-BChE complex system remained stable, indicating good stability within the simulated physiological environment. In addition, vasicine exerted good safety for PC12 cells. Above findings provide molecular insights into the inhibitory mechanism of vasicine against BChE for the first time, and offer valuable information for future structure modification and therapeutic applications of vasicine as a BChE inhibitor.",

Additionally, secondary insomnia was negatively correlated with A\u03b242 (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.225, p\u00a0=\u00a00.021) and positively with NF-L (r\u00a0=\u00a00.261, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Higher CSF palmitic acid (PA) levels observed in the HTN-U group were linked to poorer sleep quality (r\u00a0=\u00a00.208, p\u00a0=\u00a00.033). In conclusion, EH with secondary insomnia is associated with CSF biomarkers of neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, suggesting a potential increase in AD risk among this population.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of dementia globally, represents an unresolved clinical challenge due to its complex pathogenesis and the absence of effective treatments. Considering the multifactorial etiology of the disease, mainly characterized by the accumulation of amyloid \u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein, we discuss the A673V mutation in the gene coding for the amyloid precursor protein, which is associated with the familial form of Alzheimer's disease in a homozygous state. The mutation offers new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the disease, particularly regarding the contrasting roles of the A2V and A2T mutations in amyloid \u03b2 peptide aggregation and toxicity. This review aims to describe relevant studies on A2V-mutated variants of the amyloid \u03b2 peptide, revealing a protective effect against amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathology. Notably, special attention is given to the development of the peptide A\u03b21-6A2V(D), which shows significant neuroprotective activity through inhibition of the assembly of amyloid \u03b2 into amyloid fibrils. The therapeutic potential of this peptide emerges from its ability to reduce amyloid \u03b2-induced toxicity, with promising results from studies in human neuroblastoma cells and transgenic animal models.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A New Approach for Assessing the Value of Informal Care in Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: Given that most informal caregivers providing help for patients with Alzheimer's disease are retired spouses or unemployed people, there is no market value for their time. Most articles that tried to estimate the cost of informal care for Alzheimer's disease rely on the so-called \"replacement\" methodology, which assumes that 1 hour of informal care has the same value as 1 hour of professional care. Little attention has been dedicated to exploring the validity of this assumption. In this article, we determine the relationship between the price of informal caregiving and professional care from the first-order condition of a theoretical model that maximizes informal caregivers' satisfaction with providing care. METHODS: This article formalizes the marginal substitution rate between informal and formal care. We assume that the caregiver's utility depends on the caregiver's burden and the patient's quality of life (QoL). After explaining the parameters of the marginal utility of caregivers, we estimate each of these parameters using PLASA data. RESULTS: Our results show how the value of informal care increases as the care contributes to improving patients' QoL but decreases as the burden on the caregiver increases and professionals contribute to patients' QoL. CONCLUSIONS: The central assumption of the replacement cost method of perfect substitution between informal and formal care leads to a misestimation of the value of informal care. The effects of informal care must be considered (direct effect on the burden and indirect effects on the patient's QoL).",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: To estimate the excess formal social costs or direct non-healthcare costs of dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). METHODS: The presence of dementia, NPS, antipsychotic and antidepressant use, somatic and psychiatric comorbidities, and formal social benefits were studied in a regionwide cohort of all 60-year-old and older individuals. A random forest-based algorithm identified NPS, and 2-part regression models and entropy balance were used. RESULTS: Of the 215 859 individuals, 7553 (3.50%) had dementia, 74 845 (34.7%) had some NPS, and 20 787 (9.63%) received long-term care benefits. Notably, nearly two-thirds (63.9%) of people with dementia received benefits. The probability of having social costs varied markedly with age (odds ratio [OR] 12.28 [10.17-14.82] for >90-year-olds category), and the presence of dementia (OR 7.36 [6.13-8.84]) or NPS (OR 3.23 [2.69-3.88]). NPS (relative change [RC] 1.39 [1.31-1.49]) and dementia (RC 1.32 [1.24-1.41]) were associated with higher average benefit costs. Low socioeconomic status was significantly associated with both a higher probability of receiving benefits (OR 1.52 [1.38-1.68]) and higher costs of their provision (RC 1.18 [1.15-1.21]). CONCLUSIONS: The burden of caring for NPS is greater than that indicated by the literature as these symptoms multiply the social costs of dementia by more than 3, owing to the greater use of residential care and formal coverage reaching more patients than that indicated by the literature. The greater presence of dementia and NPS in the population of lower socioeconomic status indicates an inequality in health attenuated by greater use of social benefits.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Rg1 improves Alzheimer's disease by regulating mitochondrial dynamics mediated by the AMPK/Drp1 signaling pathway.",
        "AbstractText": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, characterized by a complex pathogenesis that includes A\u03b2 deposition, abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein, chronic neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In traditional medicine, ginseng is revered as the 'king of herbs'. Ginseng has the effects of greatly tonifying vital energy, strengthening the spleen and benefiting the lungs, generating fluids and nourishing the blood, and calming the mind while enhancing intelligence. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) is a well-defined major active component found in ginseng, known for its relatively high content. It has been demonstrated to exhibit neuroprotective effects in both in vivo and in vitro models, capable of ameliorating A\u03b2 and tau pathology, regulating synaptic function, and reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. However, the potential of Rg1 to improve AD pathology through the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics is still uncertain. AIM OF THE STUDY: Despite the active research efforts on drugs for AD, the currently available anti-AD medications can only slow disease progression and manage symptoms, yet unable to provide a cure for AD. Furthermore, some anti-AD drugs failed phase III and IV clinical trials due to significant side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further investigate the pathogenesis of AD, to identify new therapeutic targets, and to explore more effective therapies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of Rg1 on APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and A\u03b242-induced HT22\u00a0cell models, and to investigate the potential mechanisms through which it provides neuroprotective effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigates the effects of Rg1 in treating AD on APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and A\u03b242-induced HT22\u00a0cells. In the in vivo experiments, APP/PS1 mice were divided into a model group, Rg1-L group, Rg1-H group, and donepezil group, with C57BL/6 mice serving as the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a012 per group). The Rg1-L and Rg1-H groups were administered Rg1 at doses of 5\u00a0mg/kg/d and 10\u00a0mg/kg/d, respectively, while the donepezil group received donepezil at a dose of 1.3\u00a0mg/kg/d. Both the control and model groups received an equal volume of physiological saline daily for 28 days. Learning and spatial memory were assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests, and neuronal damage by Nissl staining. A\u03b2 deposition was analyzed through immunohistochemistry and Western blot, while the expression levels of synaptic proteins PSD95 and SYN were evaluated via immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. The dendritic spines of neurons was observed by Golgi staining.The ultrastructure of neuronal mitochondria and synapses was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mitochondrial function was assessed through measurements of Reactive oxygen species (ROS), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), and Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression levels of AMPK, p-AMPK, Drp1, p-Drp1, OPA1, Mfn1, and Mfn2, thereby investigating the protective effects of Rg1 on mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice. In vitro experiments, HT22\u00a0cells were treated with A\u03b242 of 10\u00a0\u03bcM for 24\u00a0h to verify the therapeutic effects of Rg1. Flow cytometry was used to detect ROS and JC-1, biochemical methods were employed to measure SOD and ATP, immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression levels of PSD95 and SYN, and Western blot analysis was conducted to elucidate its potential mechanisms of action. RESULTS: The findings suggest that after 28 days of Rg1 treatment, cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice was improved. Pathological and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that Rg1 treatment significantly reduced A\u03b2 deposition and neuronal loss. Rg1 can improve synaptic dysfunction and mitochondrial function in APP/PS1 mice. Rg1 activated AMPK, enhanced p-AMPK expression, inhibited Drp1, and reduced p-Drp1 levels, which led to increased expression of OPA1, Mfn1, and Mfn2, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial fission and facilitating mitochondrial fusion. Additionally, Rg1 effectively reversed the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the increase in ROS production induced by A\u03b242 in HT22\u00a0cells, restoring SOD and ATP levels. Furthermore, Rg1 regulated mitochondrial fission mediated by the AMPK/Drp1 signaling pathway, promoting mitochondrial fusion and improving synaptic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Our research provides evidence for the neuroprotective mechanisms of Rg1 in AD models. Rg1 modulates mitochondrial dynamics through the AMPK/Drp1 signaling pathway, thereby reducing synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice and AD cell models.",

        "AbstractText": "Curcumin has been proposed as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its ability to inhibit amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide aggregates and to destabilise pre-formed ones. Derivative 27 was synthesized to improve low-dose efficacy in the context of AD. Its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-amyloidogenic activities were evaluated in chemico, in vitro using AD and neuroinflammation cell models, and in vivo using the double-transgenic APP/PS1 mice. In vitro, this curcumin derivative significantly reduced nitric oxide (NO) production and levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, inducible NO synthase, pro-interleukin-1\u03b2 (Pro-IL-1\u03b2) and cyclooxygenase-2. Furthermore, Derivative 27 activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 transcription factor (Nrf2) and significantly increased Nrf2 and heme-oxygenase-1 protein levels in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, respectively. In one-year-old APP/PS1 mice, orally administered-Derivative 27 (50 mg/Kg/day) for 28 days improved spatial short-term memory and significantly decreased hippocampal Pro-IL-1\u03b2 and amyloid precursor protein levels, as well as A\u03b2 levels in the hippocampus and plasma.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Evidence on antidementia drugs (ADD) use in developing countries, where accessibility to ADD is challenging, is limited. Our aim was to examine prescribing patterns, factors, and outcomes associated with the early-ADD use (within 3 months from diagnosis) in people with dementia. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study included individuals aged \u2265 60 years with dementia from three hospitals in Thailand between 2015 and 2020. Participants were categorized as non-ADD users, early-ADD users, and delayed users. ADD switching and one-year persistence were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with early-ADD prescribing and its impact on clinical outcomes, including in-hospital death and hospitalization. RESULTS: 3,116 patients were included. The ADD prescription rate was 14.31 %, with 79.82 % of those being early-ADD users. Donepezil was the most prescribed (70.18 %). The one-year persistence rate of any ADD was 24.89 %. Factors associated with early-ADD use included the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme, dyslipidemia, and dementia type. Early-ADD use was associated with reduced in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.46, 95 % CI: 0.22-0.96, p = 0.038) and hospitalization (adjusted OR = 0.70 95 % CI: 0.51-0.97, p = 0.034) after controlling for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. CONCLUSION: ADD prescription rates were relatively low, with a one-year persistence rate of 25 %. Early-ADD use may improve clinical outcomes by reducing hospitalization and in-hospital mortality. These findings provide clinical features of ADD used in real-world settings and highlight the need for adherence to practice standards and strategies to promote ADD persistence among individuals with dementia.",

Chronic inflammatory processes are also involved in its the etiology, as the consequence or cause of proteinopathy (amyloid and tau load in the brain). This study aimed to investigate the complete blood count and systemic inflammation indices in 61 individuals with AD, compared to 59 cognitively healthy individuals as controls. The diagnosis of AD dementia was based on the NIA-AA criteria and patients presented biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid compatible with the diagnosis of AD. The complete blood count (CBC) was conducted using an automated system. The neutrophil count (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023), and Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.044) were significantly higher, whereas the lymphocyte count (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and platelet count (p\u00a0=\u00a00.038) were significantly lower in the AD group compared to the control group. After a multivariategeneralized linear model analyses, neutrophils count and SIRI maintained significant difference between the groups, even after correcting for age, sex, body mass index and ApoE \u03b54 carrier status. The overall results suggest that AD is associated with a low-grade pro-inflammatory profile, characterized by alterations in blood inflammatory and immune cells, leading to a higher systemic inflammatory index. The CBC and its derived inflammatory indices, routinely obtained in clinical practice, have potential utility in the context of AD.",

Compared to galantamine (hAChE, IC50\u00a0=\u00a01529\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0nM), C2 exhibited excellent inhibitory activities against hAChE (IC50\u00a0=\u00a0513.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.60\u00a0nM) and hBuChE (IC50\u00a0=\u00a0357.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.24\u00a0nM). Further studies revealed that C2 possessed significant abilities to protect PC12\u00a0cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The acute toxicity test in vivo indicated that C2 exhibited a remarkable safety profile. Whether in the acute memory impairment induced by the A\u03b21-42 model or in the amnesia induced by the scopolamine model, oral administration of C2 demonstrated superior improvement on cognition and spatial memory. In summary, both in vitro and in vivo results suggest that C2 deserves to be further explored as an anti-AD agent.",

However, studies on the relationship between BACE1 gene polymorphism (rs638405), brain volume, and cognition in AD patients remain scarce. To investigate the effect of genetic polymorphism in BACE1 on gray matter volume (GMV) and cognition in AD, this study recruited 111 cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls and 144 AD patients. The effect of BACE1 rs638405 polymorphism on cognition was explored in CU and AD groups. Then the interaction effect of the diagnosis and BACE1 rs638405 polymorphism on GMV was performed, following the post-hoc analysis of regions of interest (ROIs) in interaction analysis. Mediation analysis was used to elucidate the relationship among genotypes, ROIs and cognition. BACE1 rs638405 G carriers (BACE1 G+) showed significantly lower scores in global cognition and memory function than noncarriers (BACE1 G-) in AD group. Genotypes (G+/G-) and diagnosis (CU/AD) have interaction on GMV of medial temporal lobe (MTL) including the left parahippocampus and right hippocampus. Post-hoc analysis revealed that BACE1 G+ exhibited significantly lower GMV in ROIs compared to BACE1 G- in AD. Finally, mediation analysis further demonstrated that the GMV of ROIs mediated the effect of BACE1 rs638405 polymorphism on cognition in AD.

Studying the pathogenesis of AD and exploring new targets for the prevention and treatment of AD is a very worthwhile challenge. Accumulating evidence has highlighted the effects of fatty acid metabolism on AD. In this study, fatty acid metabolism was used as an entry point to understand the pathogenesis of AD and identify new targets. After identifying differentially expressed genes, multiple machine learning algorithms, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1\u00a0A (CPT1A) was identified as the key gene for fatty acid metabolism in AD. Further single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis were performed, and the GSEA results showed that the fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation pathway was enriched only in astrocytes, and the fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation pathway was down-regulated in the AD astrocytes compared to the CN astrocytes, while CPT1A was specifically downregulated in astrocytes of AD, which was confirmed in vitro experiment subsequently, and decreased expression level of CPT1A would lead to abnormal lipid metabolism, which shapes astrocyte reactivity and injury, neuroinflammatory, and thus affects AD pathogenesis. Our findings report the involvement of CPT1A in AD. We confirm that the primary role of astrocytes for fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation, and CPT1A is localized in astrocytes.

        "AbstractText": "Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal structures essential for cell architecture, cellular transport, cell motility, and cell division. Due to their dynamic nature, known as dynamic instability, microtubules can spontaneously switch between phases of growth and shortening. Disruptions in microtubule functions have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and birth defects. The role of microtubules during various phases of the cell cycle, particularly in cell division, makes them attractive targets for drug development against cancer. Several successful drugs currently on the market are designed to target microtubules. However, the presence of cellular toxicity and the development of multidrug resistance necessitate the search for new microtubule-targeting drugs.Here, a library of 106 biologically active compounds were screened to identify potent microtubule assembly inhibitors. Out of all the screened compounds, the hydroxyethylamine (HEA) analogues are found to be the best hit.We identified three inhibitors, BKS3031A, BKS3045A and BKS3046A, that bind at the same site as the well-known microtubule targeting agent colchicine. These inhibitors were simulated for 100 ns with tubulin complexes, and the results indicated that they remain stable within the binding pocket of \u03b1-\u03b2 tubulin complexes. In addition, we estimated the binding free energy of BKS3031A, BKS3045A and BKS3046A by using molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations, and it was found to be -32.67\u2009\u00b1\u20096.01, -21.77\u2009\u00b1\u20095.12 and -\u200922.92\u2009\u00b1\u20095.09\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively.

        "AbstractText": "Previous research suggests that emotional prosody perception is impaired in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA). However, no previous research has investigated emotional prosody perception in these diseases under non-ideal listening conditions. We recruited 18 patients with AD, and 31 with PPA (nine logopenic (lvPPA); 11 nonfluent/agrammatic (nfvPPA) and 11 semantic (svPPA)), together with 24 healthy age-matched individuals. Participants listened to speech stimuli conveying three emotions in clear and noise-vocoded forms and had to identify the emotion being conveyed. We then conducted correlation analyses between task performance and measures of socio-emotional functioning. All patient groups showed significant impairments in identifying clear emotional prosody compared to healthy individuals. These deficits were exacerbated under noise-vocoded conditions, with all patient groups performing significantly worse than healthy individuals and patients with lvPPA performing significantly worse than those with svPPA. Significant correlations with social cognition measures were observed more consistently for noise-vocoded than clear emotional prosody comprehension. These findings open a window on a dimension of real-world emotional communication that has often been overlooked in dementia, with particular relevance to social cognition, and begin to suggest a novel candidate paradigm for investigating and quantifying this systematically.",

        "AbstractText": "Biomarkers that aid in early detection of neurodegeneration are needed to enable early symptomatic treatment and enable identification of people who may benefit from neuroprotective interventions. Increasing evidence suggests that sleep biomarkers may be useful, given the bi-directional relationship between sleep and neurodegeneration and the prominence of sleep disturbances and altered sleep architectural characteristics in several neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to demonstrate that sleep can accurately characterize specific neurodegenerative disorders (NDD). A four-class machine-learning algorithm was trained using age and nine sleep biomarkers from patients with clinically-diagnosed manifest and prodromal NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD\u2009=\u200927), Lewy body dementia (LBD\u2009=\u200918), and isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD\u2009=\u200915), as well as a control group (CG\u2009=\u200958). The algorithm was validated in a total of 381 recordings, which included the training data set plus an additional AD\u2009=\u200910, iRBD\u2009=\u200918, Parkinson disease without dementia (PD\u2009=\u200929), mild cognitive impairment (MCI\u2009=\u200978) and CG\u2009=\u2009128. Test-retest consistency was then assessed in LBD\u2009=\u200910, AD\u2009=\u20099, and CG\u2009=\u200946. The agreement between the NDD profiles and their respective clinical diagnoses exceeded 75% for the AD, LBD, and CG, and improved when NDD participants classified Likely Normal with NDD indications consistent with their clinical diagnosis were considered. Profiles for iRBD, PD and MCI participants were consistent with the heterogeneity of disease severities, with the majority of overt disagreements explained by normal sleep characterization in 27% of iRBD, 21% of PD, and 26% of MCI participants. For test-retest assignments, the same or similar NDD profiles were obtained for 88% of LBD, 86% in AD, and 98% of CG participants. The potential utility for NDD subtyping based on sleep biomarkers demonstrates promise and requires further prospective development and validation in larger NDD cohorts.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative illness that accounts for the common type of dementia among adults over the age of 65. Despite extensive studies on the pathogenesis of the disease, early diagnosis of AD is still debatable. In this research, we performed bioinformatics approaches on the AD-related E-MTAB 6094 dataset to uncover new potential biomarkers for AD diagnosis. To achieve this, we performed in-depth in silico assays, including differentially expressed genes analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analyses, module-trait association analyses, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses, and hub genes network analyses. Finally, the expression of the identified candidate genes was evaluated in AD patients PBMC samples by qRT-PCR. Through computational analyses, we found that RN7SK LncRNA and its co-expressed genes of TNF, TNFAIP3, CCLT3, and FLT3 are from key genes in AD development that are associated with inflammatory responses. Our experimental validation revealed that RN7SK LncRNA and TNF were substantially up-regulated in AD samples (P\u2009=\u20090.006 and P\u2009=\u20090.023, respectively). Whereas, TNFAIP3 expression was significantly decreased (P\u2009=\u20090.016). However, the expression of CCL3 and FLT3 did not differ significantly between two groups (P\u2009=\u20090.396 and P\u2009=\u20090.521, respectively). In conclusion, in this study a novel LncRNA associated with AD pathogenesis were identified, which may provide new diagnostic biomarker for AD.",

We aim to assess whether CP cysts (CPCs), defined using ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), relate to aging and neurodegeneration. METHODS: We used multi-sequence 7T MRI to observe CPCs, characterizing their presence and characteristics in healthy younger controls, healthy older controls (OCs), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and patients with uremic encephalopathy. CP volume (CPV) and CPC characteristics were compared across groups, and associations between CPV and CPC features were analyzed across all subjects. RESULTS: The AD group showed a significantly higher presence and number of CPCs compared to other groups and also had a significantly larger CPV than healthy OCs. The number and size of CPCs were associated with CPV. DISCUSSION: 7T MRI offers a distinct advantage in observing CPCs, and the high prevalence of CPCs in patients with AD warrants further investigation. HIGHLIGHTS: 7T MRI enables visualization of the fine structures of the choroid plexus. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit a higher number of choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) compared to healthy older adults and other patient groups.

Insulin signaling dysfunction exacerbates tau protein phosphorylation, a hallmark of AD pathology. However, the comprehensive impact of diabetes on patterns of AD-related phosphoprotein in the human brain remains underexplored. METHODS: We performed tandem mass tag-based phosphoproteome profiling in post mortem human brain prefrontal cortex samples from 191 deceased older adults with and without diabetes and pathologic AD. RESULTS: Among 7874 quantified phosphosites, microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) phosphorylated at T529 and T534 (isoform 8 T212 and T217) were more abundant in AD and showed differential associations with diabetes. Network analysis of co-abundance patterns uncovered synergistic interactions between AD and diabetes, with one module exhibiting higher MAPT phosphorylation (15 MAPT phosphosites) and another displaying lower MAP1B phosphorylation (22 MAP1B phosphosites). DISCUSSION: This study offers phosphoproteomics insights into AD in diabetes, shedding light on mechanisms that can inform the development of therapeutics for dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: The risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is increased among older adults living with diabetes. The patterns of AD-related phosphoprotein in the human brain in older adults are differential among older adults living with diabetes.

Since subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may indicate preclinical AD, assessing AD-biomarkers is crucial. We investigated cognitive and neurodegenerative trajectories in SCD over 24 months based on biomarker positivity, and evaluated the predictive value of plasma biomarkers. METHODS: The CoSCo prospective cohort included older adults with SCD. Participants were categorized into high- and low-risk groups based on plasma biomarkers (amyloid beta [A\u03b2] 42/40, phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181], and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to compare outcomes. RESULTS: High-risk SCDs (n\u00a0=\u00a023, 23%) revealed greater decline in general cognition, memory recall, frontal function, and hippocampal volumes compared to low-risk SCDs. Combined scores of plasma and MRIs yielded the best predictions compared with other biomarker categories. DISCUSSION: SCD participants with high-risk experience faster cognitive and neurodegenerative declines. A combination of plasma biomarkers and MRIs could be used for screening and prognosis. HIGHLIGHTS: This is part of a multicenter prospective cohort study in Korea. We investigated cognitive and atrophic trajectories in SCD over 24 months. High risk SCDs revealed greater cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy. Integration of plasma and MRIs yielded better predictions than other categories.

However, it remains unclear how these regions interact to contribute to both subjective and potential objective memory issues in SCD. METHODS: To address this gap, task-based imaging studies are essential. The Mnemonic Similarity Task assessed high-fidelity retrieval meanwhile MRI data measured group differences in activation and functional connectivity (FC) (calculated by generalized psychophysiological Interaction) between SCD individuals and normal controls. RESULTS: Worse high-fidelity retrieval in SCD was associated with hypoactivation in the hippocampus, hyperactivation in the control network (CN), and reduced FC between the hippocampus and CN. The angular gyrus (AG) partially drives this disconnection. DISCUSSION: This study confirms objective cognitive deficits in SCD and highlights the AG's failure to integrate, addressing a gap in the literature that has primarily focused on the hippocampus and CN. HIGHLIGHTS: Objective high-fidelity retrieval deficits detected in older adults with SCD. Dysfunctional neural activations within retrieval networks impair memory accuracy. Reduced task-based FC drives high-fidelity retrieval deficits. The SCD-related disruption of integrative function partly explains such deficits.

RESULTS: Hallucinations, delusions, and depression were more common in DLB than in AD and, in a subgroup with longitudinal follow-up, persistent hallucinations and NPSs were associated with lower p-tau181 and p-tau231 in DLB. In adjusted linear mixed-effects models, hallucinations at baseline were associated with greater longitudinal cognitive impairment in DLB, with a significant interaction with p-tau231. DISCUSSION: Higher p-tau181 and p-tau231 levels were associated with a lower longitudinal risk of NPSs and hallucinations in early-stage DLB.

Considering associative memory deficits may reflect early signs of AD, we studied how BSO affected brain activity underlying associative memory. METHODS: Early midlife women with BSO (with and without 17\u03b2-estradiol therapy [ET]) and age-matched controls (AMCs) with intact ovaries completed a face-name associative memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Hippocampal activity along the anteroposterior axis during associative encoding and retrieval was compared among three groups (BSO [n\u00a0=\u00a028], BSO+ET [n\u00a0=\u00a035], AMCs [n\u00a0=\u00a040]). RESULTS: Both BSO groups (with and without ET) showed lower posterior hippocampal activation during encoding compared to the AMC group. However, this difference in activation was not significantly correlated with associative memory task performance. DISCUSSION: Early 17\u03b2-estradiol loss may influence posterior hippocampal activity during associative encoding, possibly presaging late-life AD. HIGHLIGHTS: After ovarian removal, changes in hippocampal function may affect dementia risk. Midlife ovarian removal is associated with less activation in the posterior hippocampus.

METHODS: Thirty patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 26 healthy controls underwent cognitive evaluations and tau, synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), and amyloid positron emission tomography. Twenty-one aMCI underwent 2-year follow-up (FU) investigations. RESULTS: Tau levels in aMCI increased longitudinally in Braak regions III through VI but not in Braak regions I and II. SV2A decreased longitudinally in all Braak regions in aMCI. Baseline tau was negatively associated with longitudinal SV2A loss in early Braak regions and with SV2A at FU across regions. Baseline tau and longitudinal change in SV2A were associated with longitudinal cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: Tau accumulation reaches a plateau in early Braak regions already in the aMCI stage of AD. In early Braak regions, the association between baseline tau and longitudinal SV2A loss might reflect synaptic dysfunction caused by tau pathology.

Since microglia are recognized as one of the key players in the disease, it is crucial to understand how microglia operate in disease conditions and incorporate them into models. The studies on human microglia functions are thought to reflect the post-symptomatic stage of the disease. Recently developed methods involve induced microglia-like cells (iMGs) generated from patients' blood monocytes or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as an alternative to studying the microglia cells in vitro. In this research, we aimed to investigate the phenotype and inflammatory responses of iMGs from AD patients. Monocytes derived from blood using density gradient centrifugation were differentiated into iMGs using a cytokine cocktail, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-34 (IL-34). After differentiation, cells were assessed by morphological analysis and a microglia surface marker, TMEM119. We used stimulants, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and beta-amyloid, to examine iMGs' functions. Results showed that iMGs derived from AD patients exhibited increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation. Furthermore, their phagocytic ability was also heightened in stimulated and unstimulated conditions, with cells derived from patients showing increased phagocytic activity compared to healthy controls. Overall, these findings suggest that iMGs derived from patients using the direct conversion method possess characteristics of human microglia, making them an easy and promising model for studying microglia function in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is significantly characterized by cognitive and memory impairments, which worsen significantly with age. In the late stages of AD, metal ion disorders and an imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels occur in the brain microenvironment, which causes abnormal aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), leading to a significant worsening of the AD symptoms. Therefore, we designed a composite nanomaterial of macrophage membranes-encapsulated Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs/MM). Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) are capable of chelating Cu2+ and reducing ROS. Macrophage membranes (MM) have advantages over liposomal and erythrocyte membrane carriers, including inflammatory targeting capabilities and more effective immune evasion. Concurrently, the excellent photothermal ability of PB NPs can briefly open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under near-infrared laser irradiation, which improves the transport efficiency of PB NPs/MM across the BBB and ablates A\u03b2 deposition, thus achieving optimal therapeutic efficacy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that PB NPs/MM is a multifunctional nanosystem, which can effectively inhibit Cu2+-induced A\u03b2 monomers aggregation, photothermally depolymerize A\u03b2 fibrils, and attenuate oxidative stress through the combined treatment of chelating metals, photothermal therapy and scavenging ROS. In behavioral experiments, it also significantly improved the cognitive and learning deficits in late-stage APP/PS1 mice, thereby providing new ideas for the treatment of late-stage AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

This review explores the impact of chronic sleep deprivation and physical exercise on brain atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Drawing insights from 40 selected studies, the review synthesizes evidence on these lifestyle factors' correlations with neurodegenerative changes. Chronic sleep deprivation disrupts circadian rhythms and neurochemical pathways, potentially accelerating brain atrophy, while physical exercise preserves brain structure by enhancing vascular health, reducing inflammation, and supporting synaptic plasticity, particularly in regions like the hippocampus. Results highlight distinct patterns of brain atrophy in AD and MCI, underscoring the potential for targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive decline. Understanding the relationship between sleep disruption and brain health provides insights into strategies for possibly delaying neurodegenerative diseases like MCI, which represents a milder form of Alzheimer's, and AD. The findings underscore the potential utility of integrating sleep therapy and physical exercise interventions in clinical practice for early detection of mild cognitive impairment and potentially delaying disease progression.

        "AbstractText": "Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is frequently associated with mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which are thought to lead to cognitive deficits by impairing NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity. Given the reliance of synaptic plasticity on NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ entry, shaping of NMDAR activity by APP and/or its disease-causing variants could provide a basis for understanding synaptic plasticity impairments associated with FAD. A region of APP (residues 639-644 within APP695) processed by the \u03b3-secretase complex, which generates amyloid-\u03b2 peptides, is a hotspot for FAD mutations. This region bears similarity to a binding motif for calcineurin (CaN), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. Interaction assays confirm that APP associates with CaN in native tissue as well as in a heterologous expression system. This capacity to bind CaN extends to APP family members amyloid precursor-like protein 1 and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP1 and APLP2, respectively). Electrophysiological analysis demonstrates that APP and its family members limit NMDAR activity, in a manner consistent with CaN-dependent regulation of NMDAR desensitization. FAD mutations, in this region of APP, impair this regulation and consequently enhance NMDAR activity. Thus, by altering the landscape for CaN regulation of NMDA receptors, FAD mutations in APP may contribute to faulty information processing by modifying the dynamic range and temporal window of a critical signal for synaptic plasticity.",

ICD-10 classified reports of dementia cases up to 2022 (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, dementia in other classified diseases, and unspecified dementia) were identified from health record linkage. Estimates of residential air pollution, traffic noise, and greenspace exposure have been modelled. Structural brain MRI was conducted from 2014 to 2022, with brain volumes relevant to dementia identified a priori. Associations between environmental exposures, brain volumes, and dementia cases (diagnosed post-MRI) were tested using linear and logistic regression and adjusted for age, sex, household income, ethnicity, education, smoking, and area-level deprivation. Mediation of exposure-outcome associations by plausible brain volumes (those associated with both environmental exposure and dementia outcomes) were modelled using the quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo method (N\u00a0=\u00a034,817-39,772). RESULTS: Small but significant mediating effects (2%-8% of relationships mediated) were observed between PM2.5abs exposure and dementia risk by reduced total brain volume, NOx and Alzheimer's disease risk by reduced peripheral cortical grey matter, PM2.5abs and vascular dementia risk by reduced peripheral cortical grey matter, PM2.5abs and other dementia risk by reduced total grey matter, and PM10 and other dementia risk by reduced total grey matter. Greenspace and noise were not associated with dementia outcomes in the subset of the cohort providing brain imaging data. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to existing evidence of associations between environmental exposures and dementia outcomes. Our findings provide novel evidence that differences in brain volume may mediate these relationships. Future research is required to prove this mechanism and establish the other mechanisms through which exposure to air pollution might increase dementia risk.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is primarily caused by oxidative stress, hyperphosphorylated \u03c4-protein aggregation, and amyloid-\u03b2 deposition. Changes in dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter pathways are linked to certain symptoms of AD. Derivatives of bicyclic and tricyclic cyclohepta[b]thiophene were developed to identify new potential candidates as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors for the treatment of AD. All synthesized compounds exhibited AChE inhibition with IC50 values below 15\u00a0\u03bcM, while all compounds exhibited BChE inhibition with IC50 values below 25\u00a0\u03bcM. Compounds 9 and 12 exhibited AChE inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 0.51\u00a0\u03bcM and 0.55\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Compounds 5 and 9 demonstrated excellent inhibitory activity against BChE with IC50 values of 2.9\u00a0\u03bcM and 2.48\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Compounds 9, 13, and 14 were found to be the most active in terms of the decrease in the escape latency time, with values comparable to that of Donepezil. Compounds 10, 11, and 12 exhibited promising effects on learning and memory.

The pathological hallmark of AD involves the aberrant aggregation of A\u03b2 peptides into amyloid fibrils, precipitating a cascade of neurodegenerative events culminating in cognitive decline and neuronal loss. This study adopts a computational framework to investigate the potential therapeutic efficacy of novel biosurfactants (BS) in mitigating A\u03b2 fibril formation. Initial analyses encompassing sequence alignment, structural elucidation, and functional characterization reveal distinctive attributes of the A\u03b2 peptide and the identified BS candidates. Quantum chemical calculations, using the ORCA Program (v4.0) employed Density Functional Theory (DFT), specifically the Becke 3-parameter Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) method, to investigate the electronic structure and energetics of novel isolates. Molecular docking through AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2) employing advanced algorithms elucidates the binding affinities and interaction energies between A\u03b2 fibrils and BS molecules. The observed binding energy of -7.0\u2009kcal/mol for BG2A and -6.6\u2009kcal/mol for BG2B, underscoring the robustness and stability of the formed complexes. The binding mechanism of docked complexes was predicted through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using GROMACS 2021.3 and Charmm36 force field, capture complex dynamics over 100 nanoseconds. Analysis via RMSD, RMSF, Rg, PCA, and SASA offers insights into A\u03b2-BS complex stability and dynamics. These promising results highlight the potential of BG2A and BG2B as therapeutic candidates against AD.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 90 patients who were divided into two equal groups of 45 people and who early had diagnosis of AD (group 1; median age - 71 [66; 77] years) and POAG (group 2; median age - 68 [64; 77] years). 71] years). All patients underwent assessment of their neurological status, neuropsychological testing, structural MRI of the brain, followed by morphometric data processing. For the purpose of comparative assessment of the obtained MRI morphometry indicators, a group of healthy individuals was taken - group 3 (n=10). RESULTS: In patients with AD, severe cognitive impairment (CI) was detected, and in patients with POAG, pre-dementia CI with a similar neurodegenerative nature was identified. According to MRI morphometry, in the group of patients with AD compared with POAG, there was a decrease in the volumes of gray matter of the brain, hippocampus, right thalamus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, right cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, as well as thicknesses: entorhinal cortex, cingulate gyrus and fusiform gyrus (p<0.05). When comparing volumes according to MRI morphometry with healthy individuals, patients with AD revealed a statistically significant decrease in all studied neuroimaging indicators, and when comparing thicknesses: left entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus; while in POAG only a decrease in the volumes of gray matter of the brain, thalamus, and right medial orbitofrontal cortex was noted. CONCLUSION: POAG can be considered not only as an independent disease, but also as a predictor of the development of AD, therefore, the statistically significant differences we obtained between the AD group and POAG according to MRI morphometry may reflect the dynamics of the neurodegenerative process and depend on the severity of CI. In this connection, MRI morphometry can be considered not only as a method of early diagnosis, but also as an assessment of disease progression. In this case, it is important to determine not only the thicknesses, but also the volumes of brain structures according to MRI morphometry data.",

Greater structural inequality was linked to reduced brain volume and connectivity, with stronger effects in Latin America, especially in the temporo-cerebellar, fronto-thalamic and hippocampal regions. In the United States, milder effects were observed in the insular-cingular and temporal areas.

Smaller cohorts have identified heterogenous diagnostic abnormalities which have predicted immunotherapy responsiveness although pattern analysis in a large cohort has never been performed. METHODS: A multi-center, retrospective study of individuals with DSRD was performed. Individuals met international consensus criteria for DRSD and were aged 10-30 years. Clinical, demographic, and diagnostic data was extracted for all individuals. Serum studies were compared to a group of individuals with DS only. RESULTS: A total of 164 individuals with DSRD were identified. Individuals with DSRD were more likely to have a positive antinuclear antibody, low complement 3, abnormal cytokines, and elevated ferritin levels. In a minority of individuals, EEG (30%), MRI (33%) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (21%) were abnormal. Individuals with CSF abnormalities demonstrated greater disease severity at diagnosis on the BFCRS and NPI-Q (p\u2009=\u20090.02 and p\u2009<\u20090.001). Abnormalities in cytokines (p\u2009=\u20090.03), neuroimaging (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and CSF (p\u2009=\u20090.02) were predictive of immunotherapy responsiveness.

We integrated blood gene expression profiles, expression quantitative trait loci, genome-wide association studies, predictive models, and conducted clinical validation.By analyzing PD datasets, a total of 953 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 10 intersecting aging differentially expressed genes (ADEGs) were identified. Enrichment analysis revealed that the regulatory pathways of these ADEGs involve the classical Wnt signaling pathway, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and neuronal apoptosis. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis showed that the MAP3K5 gene significantly reduces the risk of PD. Multivariate regression analysis identified MXD1, CREB1, and SIRT3 as key diagnostic genes and constructed a predictive model to aid clinical decision-making. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments validated the expression levels of these genes in the serum of PD patients.This study utilized a multi-omics approach to identify key ADEGs and their regulatory mechanisms in PD, leading to the establishment of a diagnostic model.

Their role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thus of great interest as they represent a potential disease-modifying therapy. Here, we explored the differential effects of microglial depletion and repopulation during amyloid pathology progression using 5xFAD mice. We utilized the CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 to induce microglial self-renewal and tracked microglia-plaque dynamics with in vivo imaging. We observed transient improvement in plaque burden on different timescales depending on the animal's age. While the improvement in plaque burden did not persist in any age group, renewing microglia during mid- to late-pathology might still be beneficial as we observed a potential improvement in microglial sensitivity to noradrenergic signaling.

When excessive and uncontrollable, anxiety can become a pathological disorder. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are psychological approaches that incorporate practices individuals can use to promote awareness, nonjudgmental acceptance, and present-moment focus. We conducted this study to evaluate the effect of MBIs for reducing anxiety among women who had undergone surgical interventions for removal of breast cancer. We used a quasi-experimental design and a convenience sample of 30 women. We used three tools for data collection: a structured questionnaire that collected sociodemographic data and assessed the participants' knowledge about breast cancer, the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, which is a self-reported Likert scale designed to assess core characteristics of mindfulness, and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale that measures the severity of an individual's anxiety. The results of our study showed that the majority (n = 24; 79.6%) of women who participated in our training program developed high levels of awareness about mindfulness. We found a highly statistically significant difference in the participants' levels of awareness of mindfulness between the pre- and postprogram evaluations (\u03c7\u00b2[29, 30] = 56.143, p < .001), and a highly statistically significant difference in the participants' anxiety levels between the pre- and postprogram evaluations (\u03c7\u00b2[29, 30] = 24.178, p < .001).

        "AbstractText": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important driver of neurodegeneration and synaptic abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) in mitochondria leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in a vicious cycle of oxidative stress in coordination with a defective electron transport chain (ETC), decreasing ATP production. AD neurons exhibit impaired mitochondrial dynamics, evidenced by fusion and fission imbalances, increased fragmentation, and deficient mitochondrial biogenesis, contributing to fewer mitochondria in brains of AD patients. Nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1) is a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis through its activation of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Our hypothesis posited that NRF1 induction in neuronal cells exposed to amyloid \u03b21-42 (A\u03b21-42) would increase de novo mitochondrial synthesis and improve mitochondrial function, restoring neuronal survival. Following NRF1 messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection of A\u03b21-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells, a marked increase in mitochondrial mass was observed. Metabolic programming toward enhanced oxidative phosphorylation resulted in increased ATP production. Oxidative stress in the form of mitochondrial ROS accumulation was reduced and mitochondrial membrane potential preserved. Mitochondrial homeostasis was maintained, evidenced by balanced fusion and fission processes. Ultimately, improvement of mitochondrial function was associated with significant decreases in A\u03b21-42-induced neuronal death and neurite disruption. Our findings highlight the potential of NRF1 upregulation to counteract A\u03b21-42-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegenerative cell processes, opening avenues for innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at safeguarding mitochondrial health in AD neurons.",

We found that genetic deletion of astrocyte-derived PTN hinders hippocampal neurogenesis. Additionally, conditional ablation of PTN in astrocytes exacerbates neurogenic deficits in the demyelinated hippocampus. Importantly, overexpression of PTN in astrocytes reverses neurogenic and cognitive impairments caused by demyelination, underscoring PTN's protective role in MS. PTN cooperates with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 (PTPRZ1) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptors to activate the AKT signaling pathway, thereby enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition in demyelinated mice. These findings illuminate novel effects of astrocyte-derived PTN on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Salt added at the table, APOE genotype and incident dementia.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The frequency of salt added at the table (i.e., to food after it has been prepared, during consumption) could reflect an individual's long-term dietary preference and habitual intake in Western countries. However, little is known about the association between the frequency of salt added at the table and incident dementia. This study investigates the association of the frequency of salt added at the table with the risk of dementia and explores differences in the associations among people with apolipoprotein E \u03b54 genotypes. METHODS: Individuals indicated whether they added salt to their food at the table (salt used for cooking was not included) \"never/rarely\", \"sometimes\", \"usually\", or \"always\". Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios with 95\u00a0% confidence intervals and evaluate the association between the frequency of salt added at the table and incident dementia. RESULTS: We observed a graded relation between the frequency of salt added at the table and spot urine sodium concentrations and estimated 24-h sodium excretion. Over a median follow-up of 13.7\u00a0years, there were 9373 cases of all-cause dementia, including 4119 of Alzheimer's disease and 2052 of vascular dementia. With a higher frequency of salt added at the table, the risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia increased in a monotonic manner after adjustment for potential confounding factors (all P-trend <0.001). These associations of the frequency of salt added at the table with the risks of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia were greater in apolipoprotein E \u03b54 heterozygotes and homozygotes. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that a higher frequency of salt added at the table was associated with a higher risk of incident dementia. This positive association was more prominent among individuals with apolipoprotein E \u03b54 heterozygotes and homozygotes.",

        "AbstractText": "Bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase C (B. cereus SMase), which plays a crucial role in bacterial virulence, has emerged as a new therapeutic target for treating opportunistic infections caused by this pathogen. It also shares catalytic domain similarity with human neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, a series of quinazoline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibition of B. cereus SMase, electric eel acetylcholinesterase (EeAChE), and equine butyrylcholinesterase (eqBuChE). Moreover, the antibacterial, anti-hemolytic and metal chelation properties of the selected compounds were determined. Among the synthesized compounds, 6-chloro-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-one (compound 4) and 6-fluoro-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-one (compound 5) exhibited promising inhibition of B. cereus SMase, with IC50 values of 6.43 and 6.50\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively. The mode of inhibition of compound 4 was determined as mixed-type inhibition by enzyme kinetic study. In addition, compounds 4 and 5 showed 59.50% and 51.66% eqBuChE inhibition at 50\u00a0\u00b5M concentration, respectively. Furthermore, compound 4 reduced B. cereus-induced hemolysis on sheep erythrocytes and able to form a complex with Cu2+ in ligand:metal ratio of 2:1. Additionally, cambinol, an inhibitor of both nSMase2 and B. cereus SMase, was found to exhibit inhibitory activity against eqBuChE, with IC50 value of 7.40\u00a0\u00b5M. The biological data were also supported by the results of molecular docking studies and in-silico physicochemical properties/ADME predictions of the selected compounds were determined.",

        "AbstractText": "Model organisms are commonly used to study human diseases; we set out to understand the relevance of several model organisms with relation to the \u03c31R protein. The study explored the interactions of \u03c31R with various agonists, antagonists across different species. Ligand and protein-protein (\u03c31R-BiP) docking approaches were used to understand the significance of \u03c31R in modulating neuroprotective mechanisms and its potential role in Alzheimer's. Ligand docking revealed that common \u03c31R antagonists generally exhibited stronger \u03c31R binding than commonly used agonists. Human \u03c31R showed high binding affinity for S1RA and NE100. Orthologs in yeast, slime mold, and C. elegans displayed varied binding affinities, indicating evolutionary adaptation in their binding pockets. We evaluated the relevance of \u03c31R-ligand interactions in C. elegans, measuring life-spans showing the impact of ligands on lifespan depends on genetic background and amyloid-beta pathology. Haloperidol (5-10\u202fmM) extended wild-type worms' lifespan, but this effect was absent in the \u03c31R-KO, suggesting at least a partial role for the \u03c31R. Fluoxetine (5-10\u202fmM) also promoted a small increase in longevity in wild-type worms but was not seen in the \u03c31R-KO strain. BD1047 (5 & 10\u202fmM) reduced the lifespan of amyloid-beta-expressing transgenic worms, whereas dipentylamine (DPA) (5\u202fmM) significantly increased the lifespan in a \u03c31R antagonist-sensitive manner. These findings highlight the importance of the \u03c31R in neurodegeneration and suggest that ligand interactions are modulated by BiP. Further research using in-vitro and in-vivo models is needed to clarify \u03c31R's therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases, where modulating \u03c31R could provide neuroprotective effects.",

Meanwhile, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of \u03b1-syn such as acetylation and phosphorylation play important yet distinct roles in regulating \u03b1-syn conformation, membrane binding, and amyloid aggregation. However, how PTMs regulate \u03b1-syn function in presynaptic terminals remains unclear. Here, based on our previous findings, we further demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation, which occurs under physiological conditions and is irreversible in mammalian cells, significantly enhances the functional activity of \u03b1-syn in clustering SVs. Mechanistic studies reveal that this enhancement is caused by the N-acetylation-promoted insertion of \u03b1-syn's N-terminus and increased intermolecular interactions on the LPC-containing membrane. N-acetylation in our work is shown to fine-tune the interaction between \u03b1-syn and LPC, mediating \u03b1-syn's role in synaptic vesicle clustering.",

However, there is a dearth of evidence-based research on advocacy strategies used to support dementia awareness. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use posts from X (formerly known as Twitter) to understand dementia advocacy strategies during World Alzheimer's Awareness Month in September 2022. METHODS: Posts were scraped from X during World Alzheimer's Awareness Month from September 1, 2022, to September 30, 2022. After applying filters, 1981 relevant posts were analyzed using thematic analysis, and measures were taken to support trustworthiness and rigor. RESULTS: Our study revealed a variety of advocacy strategies, including sharing the voices of lived experience, targeting ethnic and cultural groups, myth-busting strategies, and political lobbying. Although a range of strategies were identified, further research is needed to examine advocacy strategies within different countries and political contexts. Furthermore, the impact of specific strategies on stigma reduction, cognitive health promotion, and policy change needs to be scientifically evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers valuable insight into strategies to bolster dementia advocacy and awareness campaigns to support people living with dementia.

        "AbstractText": "IMPORTANCE: The number of older adults in long-term correctional facilities (prisons) has increased rapidly in recent years. The cognitive and functional status of this population is not well understood due to limitations in the availability of longitudinal data. OBJECTIVE: To comparatively examine the prevalence and disability status of the population of adults 55 years and older in prisons and adults living in community settings for a 14-year period (2008-2022). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This repeated cross-sectional study used nationally representative data from the American Community Survey to identify cohorts of community-dwelling adults 55 years or older and adults 55 years or older in prisons. Data were accrued from surveys from 2008 to 2022 and analyzed from August 25, 2023, to October 18, 2024. EXPOSURE: Residence in federal or state prison. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported cognitive, ambulatory, independent living, or self-care difficulties. RESULTS: The population of older adults in prisons increased between 2008 and 2022 from 102\u202f700 to 171\u202f700, but the pace of growth slowed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis included 32 623 adults 55 years or older in prison (mean [SD] age, 62.6 [8.3] years; 28 927 [89.64%] male) and 13\u202f877\u202f665 living in the community (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [9.5] years; 7 497 784 [54.02%] female). Disability prevalences in all categories, including cognitive, ambulatory, independent living, and self-care difficulties, were significantly higher compared with their community-dwelling peers. The difference was particularly stark for cognitive difficulty, which was 15.2% (95% CI, 14.8%-15.7%) for older adults in prisons vs 7.1% (95% CI, 7.1%-7.2%) in the community, after adjusting for demographic characteristics. These prevalences have remained stable over the sample period, including the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this cross-sectional study suggest that adults in prison are more likely to report disability than those in community settings, with the largest differences in cognitive difficulties. These differences persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The notable increase among older adults in prisons coupled with the high prevalences of disability has important implications for identifying care models and environmental policies to address the chronic and end-of-life care needs of this population, particularly within the context of constrained resources of health care in prisons.",

        "AbstractText": "The accurate diagnosis of aging-related neurocognitive disorders as early as possible, even in a phase that is characterized by the absence of clinical symptoms, is nowadays the holy grail of the neurosciences. R4Alz-R is a novel cognitive tool designed to objectively detect the subtle cognitive changes that emerge as the very first result of the aging processes and could be developed and broadened in a continuum from healthy aging to subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), before reaching some type of dementia. The goal of the present study was to examine whether the R4Alz-R battery has the potential to detect these subtle changes. The study sample comprised 184 people divided into (a) cognitively healthy young adults (HCya), (b) cognitively healthy older adults (HCoa), (c) people diagnosed with SCI, and (d) people diagnosed with MCI. The R4Alz-R comprises tests examining short-term memory storage, information processing, and updating of working memory, attention in different types of it, and main dimensions of executive functioning such as set-shifting, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility, as well as episodic memory. The flexibility and attention score showed an excellent potential to discriminate HCya from SCI (AUC 0.936, sensitivity 89.7%, specificity 88.4%). The executive functioning score almost excellently discriminated HCoa from SCI (AUC 0.898, sensitivity 87%, specificity 76.5%), while the fluid intelligence score had also an excellent potential to discriminate HCoa from MCI (AUC 0.953, sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 94.1%). The findings show that cognitive impairment in aging may start from the frontal lobe and prefrontal cortex, areas more closely related to cognitive control rather than memory. The lack of significant differences between HCya and HCoa proves that healthy older adults can keep their cognition at almost the same level as younger adults, a finding consistent with the new theoretical models regarding aging. The R4Alz-R battery is an innovative, free-of-demographic effect, valid, and reliable tool that can provide a highly accurate diagnosis of aging-related cognitive decline in its beginnings when it could still be possible to be reversed.",

Innate immune cells, such as macrophages, mast cells (MCs), natural killer cells and neutrophils, bear pattern recognition receptors and are thus able to recognize common molecular patterns, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the later occurring in the context of neuroinflammation. An inflammatory component in the pathology of otherwise \"primary cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative\" disease has recently been recognized and targeted as a means of therapeutic intervention. Activated MCs are multifunctional effector cells generated from hematopoietic stem cells that, together with dendritic cells, represent first-line immune defense mechanisms against pathogens and/or tissue destruction. METHODS: This review aims to summarize evidence of MC implication in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. RESULTS: In view of recent evidence that the gut-brain axis may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and the characterization of the neuroinflammatory component in the pathology of these diseases, this review also focuses on MCs as potential mediators in the gut-brain axis bi-directional communication and the possible role of Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen known to alter the gut-brain axis homeostasis towards local and systemic pro-inflammatory responses.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, a class of novel antidiabetic agents, have demonstrated promising therapeutic effects beyond glycemic control, with potential benefits extending to the cardiovascular and renal systems. Recently, research has increasingly focused on exploring the potential role of SGLT-2 inhibitors in preventing dementia. The aim of this review is to summarize the current research suggesting that SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, may have neuroprotective effects that reduce dementia risk and improve cognitive function in type 2 diabetes patients. These benefits are likely due to better glycemic control, reduced oxidative stress, and less advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation, all linked to neurodegeneration. Despite these promising findings, existing studies are limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up durations, which may not adequately capture long-term outcomes. To establish more robust evidence, larger-scale, long-term randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving diverse populations are needed. These studies should involve diverse populations and focus on understanding the mechanisms behind the neuroprotective effects. Addressing these limitations will provide clearer guidelines for using SGLT-2 inhibitors in dementia prevention and management. This will help improve therapeutic strategies for cognitive health in diabetic patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Circadian rhythms are intrinsic, 24 h cycles that regulate key physiological, mental, and behavioral processes, including sleep-wake cycles, hormone secretion, and metabolism. These rhythms are controlled by the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus, which synchronizes with environmental signals, such as light and temperature, and consequently maintains alignment with the day-night cycle. Molecular feedback loops, driven by core circadian \"clock genes\", such as Clock, Bmal1, Per, and Cry, are essential for rhythmic gene expression; disruptions in these feedback loops are associated with various health issues. Dysregulated lipid metabolism in the brain has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders by contributing to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction, as observed in conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Disruptions in circadian gene expression have been shown to perturb lipid regulatory mechanisms in the brain, thereby triggering neuroinflammatory responses and oxidative damage. This review synthesizes current insights into the interconnections between circadian rhythms and lipid metabolism, with a focus on their roles in neurological health and disease. It further examines how the desynchronization of circadian genes affects lipid metabolism and explores the potential mechanisms through which disrupted circadian signaling might contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders.",

Saliva, with its non-invasive and cost-effective nature, presents a promising alternative to cerebrospinal fluid and plasma for biomarker discovery. Methods: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of saliva samples (n = 20 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 20 Alzheimer's disease and age- and n = 40 gender-matched cognitively normal individuals), from the South Australian Neurodegenerative Disease (SAND) cohort, integrating proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiome data with plasma measurements, including pTau181. Results: Among the most promising findings, the protein Stratifin emerged as a top candidate, showing a strong negative correlation with plasma pTau181 (r = -0.49, p < 0.001) and achieving an AUC of 0.95 in distinguishing AD and MCI combined from controls. In the metabolomics analysis, 3-chlorotyrosine and L-tyrosine exhibited high correlations with disease severity progression, with AUCs of 0.93 and 0.96, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in vitamin B12 metabolism, with Transcobalamin-1 levels decreasing in saliva as AD progressed despite an increase in serum vitamin B12 levels (p = 0.008). Microbiome analysis identified shifts in bacterial composition, with a microbiome cluster containing species such as Lautropia mirabilis showing a significant decrease in abundance in MCI and AD samples. The overall findings were reinforced by weighted correlation network analysis, which identified key hubs and enriched pathways associated with AD.

In recent years, the integration of cutting-edge medical imaging technologies with forefront theories in artificial intelligence has dramatically enhanced the efficiency of identifying and diagnosing brain diseases such as AD. This paper presents an innovative two-stage automatic auxiliary diagnosis algorithm for AD, based on an improved 3D DenseNet segmentation model and an improved MobileNetV3 classification model applied to brain MR images. In the segmentation network, the backbone network was simplified, the activation function and loss function were replaced, and the 3D GAM attention mechanism was introduced. In the classification network, firstly, the CA attention mechanism was added to enhance the model's ability to capture positional information of disease features; secondly, dilated convolutions were introduced to extract richer features from the input feature maps; and finally, the fully connected layer of MobileNetV3 was modified and the idea of transfer learning was adopted to improve the model's feature extraction capability. The results of the study showed that the proposed approach achieved classification accuracies of 97.85% for AD/NC, 95.31% for MCI/NC, 93.96% for AD/MCI, and 92.63% for AD/MCI/NC, respectively, which were 3.1, 2.8, 2.6, and 2.8 percentage points higher than before the improvement.

Leveraging the geometric principles of non-Euclidean space, certain geometric deep learning approaches may offer an alternative means of improving model generalizability. This study investigates the potential advantages of hyperbolic convolutional neural networks (HCNNs) over traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in neuroimaging tasks. We conducted a comparative analysis of HCNNs and CNNs across various medical imaging modalities and diseases, with a focus on a compiled multi-modality neuroimaging dataset. The models were assessed for their performance parity, robustness to adversarial attacks, semantic organization of embedding spaces, and generalizability. Zero-shot evaluations were also performed with ischemic stroke non-contrast CT images. HCNNs matched CNNs' performance in less complex settings and demonstrated superior semantic organization and robustness to adversarial attacks. While HCNNs equaled CNNs in out-of-sample datasets identifying Alzheimer's disease, in zero-shot evaluations, HCNNs outperformed CNNs and radiologists. HCNNs deliver enhanced robustness and organization in neuroimaging data. This likely underlies why, while HCNNs perform similarly to CNNs with respect to in-sample tasks, they confer improved generalizability. Nevertheless, HCNNs encounter efficiency and performance challenges with larger, complex datasets. These limitations underline the need for further optimization of HCNN architectures. HCNNs present promising improvements in generalizability and resilience for medical imaging applications, particularly in neuroimaging. Despite facing challenges with larger datasets, HCNNs enhance performance under adversarial conditions and offer better semantic organization, suggesting valuable potential in generalizable deep learning models in medical imaging and neuroimaging diagnostics.",

Male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups: control (n = 6), scopolamine (SCP) (n = 7), SCP + MCP (n = 7), and MCP only (n = 7). MCP was administered orally at 100 mg/kg/day via drinking water for six weeks. SCP was injected intraperitoneally at 1 mg/kg for seven days to induce an Alzheimer's-type dementia model. The researchers assessed cognitive performance through the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. After behavioral tests, blood and brain tissues, including the hippocampus, were collected and stored at -80 \u00b0C for analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and inflammatory markers (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and galectin-3).

It contains the N-terminal, conserved kinase domain, a coiled-coil region, a proline-rich region, and a GCK, C-terminal domain with the Citron-NIK-Homology (CNH) domain. The kinase is an essential component of cellular signaling pathways, which include Wnt signaling, JNK signaling, pathways engaging Ras proteins, the Hippo pathway, and STRIPAK complexes. It thus contributes to regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, embryogenesis, or tissue homeostasis. MINK1 plays an important role in immunological responses, inhibiting Th17 and Th1 cell differentiation and regulating NLRP3 inflammasome function. It may be considered a link between ROS and the immunological system, and a potential antiviral target for human enteroviruses. The kinase has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, SLE, and more. It is also involved in tumorigenesis and drug resistance in cancer. Silencing MINK1 reduces cancer cell migration, suggesting potential for new therapeutic approaches. Targeting MINK1 could be a promising treatment strategy for patients insensitive to current chemotherapies, and could improve their prognosis. Moreover, MINK1 plays an important role in the nervous system and the cardiovascular system development and function. The modulation of MINK1 activity could influence the course of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Further exploration of the activity of the kinase could also help in gaining more insight into factors involved in thrombosis or congenital heart disease.

In this study, we investigated the ability of the P300 indices evoked during a visual oddball task to differentiate pre-clinically diagnosed participants from normal healthy adults (HCs). Two preclinical stages, named asymptomatic AD (AAD) and prodromal AD (PAD), were included in this study, and a total of 79 subjects participated, including 35 HCs, 22 AAD patients, and 22 PAD patients. A mixed-design ANOVA test was performed to compare the P300 indices among groups during the processing of the target and non-target stimuli. Additionally, the correlation between these neurophysiological variables and the neuropsychological tests was evaluated. Our results revealed that neither the peak amplitude nor latency of P300 can distinguish AAD from HCs. Conversely, the peak latency of P300 can be used as a biomarker to differentiate PAD from AAD and HCs. The correlation results revealed a significant relationship between the peak latency of P300 and memory domain tasks, showing that less time-demanding neuropsychological assessments can be used. In summary, our findings showed that a combination of P300 latency and memory-requiring tasks can be used as an efficient biomarker to differentiate individuals with AAD from HCs.",

        "AbstractText": "Background/Objectives: The annual incidence of falls is high in older adults with impaired cognitive function and dementia, and injuries have a detrimental effect on disability-adjusted life-years and public health spending. In this registry-based study, fall incidence and characteristics of the fallers were explored in a large population with cognitive impairment. Methods: NorCog, \"The Norwegian Registry of Persons Assessed for Cognitive Symptoms\", is a national research and quality registry with a biomaterial collection. This study included 9525 persons from the registry who had answered the question about falls. Fall incidence was studied, and the characteristics of fallers and non-fallers were compared. Results: The annual fall incidence was 3774/9525 (39.6%). The incidence varied between types of dementia, from 22.4% in persons with the debut of Alzheimer's disease before 65 years of age to 55.3% in persons with vascular dementia and with increasing degrees of cognitive impairment. A wide range of personal characteristics, symptoms, signs, laboratory tests, and physical, psychological, and cognitive tests differed between fallers and non-fallers, most in disfavour of the fallers. Age, reduced Personal Activities of Daily Living, reduced gait speed, delayed recall, use of a walking aid, and depression were independent predictors of falls. Conclusions: Among cognitively impaired persons with a history of falls, frailty was an independent predictor of falls. Neither the type of dementia nor the degree of cognitive impairment were independent predictors of falls. Prevention of frailty by physical training and social activity may be important in mitigating fall risk among older adults with impaired cognition.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Social activity is associated with better cognitive health in old age. To better translate epidemiological research for public health communication, we estimated relations of levels of social activity to average age at dementia onset. METHODS: In the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), we followed 1923 dementia-free older adults and conducted annual clinical evaluations of dementia/mild cognitive impairment (MCI). RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 6.7 (SD\u00a0=\u00a04.7) years, 545 participants developed dementia, and 695 developed MCI. Using Accelerated Failure Time models adjusted for age, sex, education, race/ethnicity, and marital status, we found predicted mean age of dementia onset for the least socially active was 87.7 years, approximately 5 years earlier than the most socially active (mean age\u00a0=\u00a092.2, p <\u00a0.01); we found a similar 5-year difference in age at MCI onset by social activity. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the value of social activity as a possible community-level intervention for reducing dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Accelerated failure time models estimated age at dementia onset by social activity level to aid interpretation. Higher social activity was associated with a 5-year older age at dementia onset. Economic research shows a 5-year delay translates to US$500,000 of healthcare savings per capita.

        "AbstractText": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), characterized by insulin resistance, is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrovascular dysfunction is manifested in both T2DM and AD, and is often considered as a pathological link between the two diseases. Insulin signaling regulates critical functions of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and endothelial insulin resistance could lead to BBB dysfunction, aggravating AD pathology. However, insulin signaling is intrinsically dynamic and involves interactions among numerous molecular mediators. Hence, a mechanistic systems biology model is needed to understand how insulin regulates BBB physiology and the consequences of its impairment in T2DM and AD. In this study, we investigated the pharmacodynamic effect of insulin on the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), a marker of cerebrovascular inflammation. Intriguingly, normal insulin concentrations selectively activated the PI3K-AKT pathway, leading to decreased VCAM1 expression. However, exposure to supraphysiological insulin levels, which is present in insulin resistance, activated both PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK pathways, and increased VCAM1 expression. We developed a mathematical model that adequately described the dynamics of various insulin signaling nodes and VCAM1 expression. Further, the model was integrated with in\u00a0vitro proteomics and transcriptomics data from AD patients to simulate VCAM1 expression under pathological conditions. This approach allowed us to establish a quantitative systems pharmacology framework to investigate BBB dysfunction in AD and metabolic syndrome, thereby offering opportunities to identify specific disruptions in molecular networks that will enable us to identify novel therapeutic targets.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: There are numerous communication barriers between family caregivers and providers of people living with dementia, which can pose challenges to caregiving and clinical decision-making. To address these barriers, a new web and mobile-enabled app, called CareHeroes, was developed, which promotes the collection and secured sharing of clinical information between caregivers and providers. It also provides caregiver support and education. OBJECTIVE: The primary study objective was to examine whether dementia caregivers would use CareHeroes as an adjunct to care and gather psychosocial data from those who used the app. METHODS: This paper presents the implementation process used to integrate CareHeroes into clinical care at 2 memory clinics and preliminary outcome evaluation. Family caregivers receiving services at clinics were asked to use the app for a 12-month period to collect, track, and share clinical information with the care recipient's provider. They also used it to assess their own mental health symptoms. Psychosocial outcomes were assessed through telephone interviews and user data were collected by the app. RESULTS: A total of 21 caregivers enrolled in the pilot study across the 2 memory clinics. Usage data indicated that caregivers used many of the features in the CareHeroes app, though the chatbot was the most frequently used feature. Outcome data indicated that caregivers' depression was lower at 3-month follow-up (t11=2.03, P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment and retention of the pilot study were impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, and therefore more testing is needed with a larger sample to determine the potential impact of CareHeroes on caregivers' mental health. Despite this limitation, the pilot study demonstrated that integrating a new supportive app for caregivers as an adjunct to clinical dementia care is feasible. Implications for future technology intervention development, implementation planning, and testing for caregivers of people living with dementia are discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "Recombinant antibodies are a promising class of therapeutics to treat protein misfolding associated with neurodegenerative diseases, and several antibodies that inhibit aggregation are approved or in clinical trials to treat Alzheimer's disease. Here, we developed antibodies targeting the aggregation-prone \u03b2-propeller olfactomedin (OLF) domain of myocilin, variants of which comprise the strongest genetic link to glaucoma and cause early onset vision loss for several million individuals worldwide. Mutant myocilin aggregates intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subsequent ER stress causes cytotoxicity that hastens dysregulation of intraocular pressure, the primary risk factor for most forms of glaucoma. Our antibody discovery campaign yielded two recombinant antibodies: anti-OLF1 recognizes a linear epitope, while anti-OLF2 is selective for natively folded OLF and inhibits aggregation in vitro. By binding OLF, these antibodies engage autophagy/lysosomal degradation to promote degradation of two pathogenic mutant myocilins. This work demonstrates the potential for therapeutic antibodies to disrupt ER-localized protein aggregates by altering the fate of folding intermediates. This approach could be translated as a precision medicine to treat myocilin-associated glaucoma with in situ antibody expression. More generally, the study supports the approach of enhancing lysosomal degradation to treat proteostasis decline in glaucoma and other diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Modifiable risk factors play an important role in preventing dementia and reducing its progression. Regular physical activity already in midlife, which relies on intact multisensory balance control, can help to decrease the risk of dementia. However, our understanding of the relationship between postural balance and cognitive functions remains limited. The objective of our study was to investigate the association of postural balance during different sensory conditions with specific cognitive domains in older adults. METHODS: Participants were from the population-based prospective \"Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases\" (LIFE-Adult) cohort in Leipzig, Germany. Executive, memory and processing speed functions were tested by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) plus battery. Assessment of visuospatial abilities was based on the short form of the Judgment of Line Orientation Test (JLO). Postural sway was recorded on a force plate with eyes open and closed. Romberg's ratios were calculated for sway path and sway area as a proxy for balance without visual control and tested in generalized linear regression models with the summary scores of executive function, memory, processing speed and visuospatial function as dependent variables. All models were adjusted for sex, age, ApoE status, socioeconomic status, anamnestic stroke, and diabetes. RESULTS: In total, we analyzed 460 participants with a mean age of 68.6\u202fyears, range 60 to 80, 47.6% female. A higher Romberg's ratio for sway area was a significant indicator for impaired visuospatial abilities as measured by the dichotomized JLO (Odds Ratio\u202f=\u202f1.42, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.88). Romberg's ratios were not significantly associated with executive functions, procedural speed or memory functions. DISCUSSION: It may be worthwhile to examine in the future whether inclusion of balance testing enhances the value of screening programs for cognitive impairment. Inversely, it may be appropriate to apply routine cognitive tests when balance problems are detected in older patients.",

METHODS: Two hundred twenty Penn Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participants with unimpaired cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia completed the T-Cog during their annual UDS evaluation. We assessed administration feasibility and diagnostic group differences cross-sectionally across telephone versus videoconference modalities, and compared T-Cog to prior in-person UDS scores longitudinally. RESULTS: Administration time averaged 54 min and 79% of participants who initiated a T-Cog completed all 12 subtests; completion time and rates differed by diagnostic group but not by modality. Performance varied expectedly across groups with moderate to strong associations between most T-Cog measures and in-person correlates, although select subtests demonstrated lower comparability. DISCUSSION: The T-Cog is feasibly administered and shows preliminary validity in a cognitively heterogeneous cohort. Normative data from this cohort should be expanded to more diverse populations to enhance utility and generalizability. HIGHLIGHTS: This study examined the feasibility and validity of the remote Uniform Data Set (also known as the T-Cog) and contributes key normative data for widespread use.A remote neuropsychological battery was feasibly administered with high overall engagement and completion rates, adequate reliability compared to in-person testing, and evidence of validity across diagnostic groups.Typical barriers to administration included hearing impairment, technology issues, and distractions; hearing difficulties were particularly common among cognitively impaired groups.Certain tests were less closely related to their in-person correlates and should be used with caution.",

Integrate VGG-16 with Random Forest (VGG-16-RF) and VGG-16 with Support Vector Machine (VGG-16-SVM) to enhance the binary classification accuracy of Alzheimer's disease, comparing their performance against traditional classifiers. METHOD: OpenNeuro and Harvard's Data verse provides Alzheimer's coronal functional MRI data. Ventricles and hippocampus are segmented using a Deep-Residual-UNet and Deep labV3+ system. The functional features were extracted from each segmented component and classified using SVM, Adaboost, Logistic regression, and VGG 16, DenseNet-169, VGG-16-RF, and VGG-16-SVM classifier. RESULTS: This research proposes a precise and efficient deep-learning architecture like DeepLab V3+ and Deep Residual U-NET for hippocampus and ventricle segmentation in detection of AD. DeepLab V3+ has produced a good segmentation accuracy of 94.62% with Jaccard co-efficient of 85.5% and dice co-efficient of 84.75%. Among the three ML classifiers used, SVM has provided a good accuracy of 93%. Among some DL techniques, VGG-16-RF classifier has given better accuracy of 96.87%. CONCLUSION: The novelty of this work lies in the seamless integration of advanced segmentation techniques with hybrid classifiers, offering a robust and scalable framework for early AD detection. The proposed study demonstrates a significant advancement in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease by integrating state-of-the-art deep learning models and comprehensive functional connectivity analysis.

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Abnormal intracellular accumulation of Tau aggregates is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other Tauopathies, such as Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Tau deposits primarily affect neurons, but evidence indicates that glial cells may also be affected and contribute distinctively to disease progression. Cells can respond to toxic insults by orchestrating global changes in posttranslational modifications of their proteome. Previous studies suggest that SUMOylation, a posttranslational modification consisting of conjugation of SUMO (Small ubiquitin-like modifier) to target proteins, was decreased in the hippocampus of AD patients and in animal model of AD compared with controls. This decrease in SUMOylation was correlated with increased Tau pathology and cognitive decline. Other studies have reported increased levels of SUMO in AD brains. The goal of our study was to evaluate whether SUMO conjugation modifies the neurodegenerative disease pathology associated with the aggregation-prone mutant TauP301L, in neurons and in glial cells. METHODS: We used viral approaches to express mutant TauP301L and SUMO2 in the hippocampus of wild-type mice. We assessed Tau distribution by immunostaining and Tau aggregation by insolubility assays followed by western blotting. We assessed neuronal toxicity and performed cell count and shape descriptor analyses on astrocytes and microglial cells. RESULTS: We found that mutant TauP301L, when expressed exclusively in neurons, is toxic not only to neurons but also to glial cells, and that SUMO2 counteracts TauP301L toxicity in neurons as well as in glia. DISCUSSION: Our results uncover an endogenous neuroprotective mechanism, whereby SUMO2 conjugation reduces Tau neuropathology and protects against toxic effects of Tau in glial cells.",

How the latent processes of selective attention (i.e., from perception to motor response) contribute to these inhibition deficits remains unclear. Therefore, the present study examined contributions of selective attention to aMCI-related inhibition deficits using computational modeling of attentional dynamics. Two models of selective attention - the dual-stage two-phase model and the shrinking spotlight model - were fitted to individual participant data from a flanker task completed by 34 individuals with single-domain aMCI (sdaMCI, 66-86\u2009years), 20 individuals with multiple-domain aMCI (mdaMCI, 68-88\u2009years), and 52\u00a0healthy controls (64-88\u2009years). Findings showed greater commission errors in the mdaMCI group compared to controls. Final-fitting model parameters indicated inhibitory and early perceptual deficits in mdaMCI , and impaired spatial allocation of attention in both MCI groups. Model parameters differentiated mdaMCI from sdaMCI and controls with moderate-to-high sensitivity and specificity. Impairments in perception and selective attention may contribute to inhibition deficits in both aMCI subtypes.",

This study aimed to clarify the regulatory mechanism underlying the PgOMV-induced AD-like phenotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We intraperitoneally injected PgOMVs into the periphery of wild-type and CatB knockout mice for 4 or 8\u2009weeks to assess the effect of CatB on PgOMV-induced AD pathology. Mice were evaluated for cognitive change, tau phosphorylation, microglial activation, neuroinflammation and synapse loss. Microglial and primary neuron culture were prepared to verify the in\u00a0vivo results. RESULTS: CatB deficiency significantly alleviated PgOMV-induced cognitive dysfunction, microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation and synapse loss. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting suggested that CatB modulates microglia-mediated neuroinflammation through stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK)/Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) signals after administration of PgOMVs, which in turn regulates neuronal tau phosphorylation and synapse loss in a SAPK/JNK-dependent manner.

        "AbstractText": "The microglial triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is required for diverse microglia responses in neurodegeneration, including immunometabolic plasticity, phagocytosis, and survival. We previously identified that patient iPSC-derived microglia (iPS-Mg) harboring the Alzheimer's disease (AD) TREM2R47H hypomorph display several functional deficits linked to metabolism. To investigate whether these deficits are associated with disruptions in metabolite signaling, we generated common variant, TREM2R47H and TREM2-/- variant human iPS-Mg. We assessed the ability of supplementation with citrate or succinate, key metabolites and cell cycle breaking points upon microglia activation, to overcome these functional deficits with potential impact on neurons. Succinate supplementation was more effective than citrate at overcoming mitochondrial deficits in OXPHOS and did not promote a glycolytic switch. Citrate enhanced the lipid content of TREM2R47H iPS-Mg and was more effective at overcoming \u0391\u03b2 phagocytic deficits, whereas succinate increased lipid content and phagocytic capacity in TREM2-/- iPS-Mg. Microglia cytokine secretion upon pro-inflammatory activation was moderately affected by citrate or succinate showing a condition-dependent increasing trend. Neither metabolite altered basal levels of soluble TREM2 shedding. In addition, neither citrate nor succinate enhanced glycolysis; instead, drove their effects through oxidative phosphorylation. IPS-neurons exposed to conditioned medium from TREM2 variant iPS-Mg showed changes in oxidative phosphorylation, which could be ameliorated when iPS-Mg were first treated with citrate or succinate.

However, the pathogenic mechanism of neurological symptoms associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is poorly understood. METHODS: We used Drosophila as a model to systematically analyze SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding structural and accessory proteins and identified the membrane protein (M) that disrupted mitochondrial functions in vivo. The M protein was stereotaxically injected to further assess its effects in the brains of wild-type (WT) and 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009FAD mice. Omics technologies, including RNA sequencing and interactome analysis, were performed to explore the mechanisms of the effects of M protein both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Systematic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 structural and accessory proteins in Drosophila identified that the M protein induces mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction, leading to reduced ATP production, ROS overproduction, and eventually cell death in the indirect flight muscles. In WT mice, M caused hippocampal atrophy, neural apoptosis, glial activation, and mitochondrial damage. These changes were further aggravated in 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009FAD mice. M was localized to the Golgi apparatus and genetically interacted with four wheel drive (FWD, a Drosophila homolog of mammalian PI4KIII\u03b2) to regulate Golgi functions in flies. Fwd RNAi, but not PI4KIII\u03b1 RNAi, reversed the M-induced Golgi abnormality, mitochondrial fragmentation, and ATP reduction. Inhibition of PI4KIII\u03b2 activity suppressed the M-induced neuronal cell death. Therefore, M induced mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis likely through disruption of Golgi-derived PI(4)P-containing vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: M disturbs the distribution and function of Golgi, leading to mitochondrial abnormality and eventually neurodegeneration via a PI4KIII\u03b2-mediated mechanism.

Imputation of missing values is an inevitable step in every incomplete univariate time series. Most of the existing studies focus on comparing the distributions of imputed data. There is a gap of knowledge on how different imputation methods for univariate time series affect the forecasting performance of time series models. We evaluated the prediction performance of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network models on imputed time series data using ten different imputation techniques. METHODS: Missing values were generated under missing completely at random (MCAR) mechanism at 10%, 15%, 25%, and 35% rates of missingness using complete data of 24-h ambulatory diastolic blood pressure readings. The performance of the mean, Kalman filtering, linear, spline, and Stineman interpolations, exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), simple moving average (SMA), k-nearest neighborhood (KNN), and last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) imputation techniques on the time series structure and the prediction performance of the LSTM and ARIMA models were compared on imputed and original data. RESULTS: All imputation techniques either increased or decreased the data autocorrelation and with this affected the forecasting performance of the ARIMA and LSTM algorithms. The best imputation technique did not guarantee better predictions obtained on the imputed data. The mean imputation, LOCF, KNN, Stineman, and cubic spline interpolations methods performed better for a small rate of missingness. Interpolation with EWMA and Kalman filtering yielded consistent performances across all scenarios of missingness. Disregarding the imputation methods, the LSTM resulted with a slightly better predictive accuracy among the best performing ARIMA and LSTM models; otherwise, the results varied. In our small sample, ARIMA tended to perform better on data with higher autocorrelation. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend to the researchers that they consider Kalman smoothing techniques, interpolation techniques (linear, spline, and Stineman), moving average techniques (SMA and EWMA) for imputing univariate time series data as they perform well on both data distribution and forecasting with ARIMA and LSTM models. The LSTM slightly outperforms ARIMA models, however, for small samples, ARIMA is simpler and faster to execute.",

However, the mechanisms linking HL to AD are not fully understood. This study explored the effects of drug-induced hearing loss (DIHL) on the expression of proteins associated with AD progression in mouse models. METHODS: DIHL was induced in 5xFAD and Tg2576 mice aged 3 to 3.5\u00a0weeks using kanamycin (700\u00a0mg/kg, subcutaneous) and furosemide (600\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneal). The accumulation and expression of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured through immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Additionally, the expression of proteins involved in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, including downstream effectors p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) and S6, as well as proinflammatory cytokines, was analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to control conditions, HL led to a significant increase in the accumulation of A\u03b2 in the hippocampus and cortex. Elevated levels of neuroinflammatory markers, including Iba1 and GFAP, as well as proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), were observed. Moreover, DIHL enhanced phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and S6, indicating activation of the mTOR pathway. CONCLUSIONS: HL significantly increases A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain. Furthermore, HL activates astrocytes and microglia, leading to increased neuroinflammation and thereby accelerating AD progression. These findings strongly suggest that HL contributes autonomously to neuroinflammation, highlighting the potential for early intervention in HL to reduce AD risk.",

The validation of the model also yielded a favorable discriminatory ability with the AUC of 0.91, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 82%, 91%, 0.93, and 0.77 to identify AD patients from NC. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This novel AI-driven eye-tracking technology has the potential to reliably identify differences in eye-movement abnormalities in AD. The model shows excellent diagnostic performance in identifying AD based on the current data collected. The use of mobile devices makes it accessible for AD patients to complete tasks in primary clinical settings or follow up at home.",

        "AbstractText": "Spatial impairment characterizes Alzheimer's disease (AD) from its earliest stages. We present the design and preliminary evaluation of \"Barn Ruins,\" a serious virtual reality (VR) wayfinding game for early-stage AD. Barn Ruins is tailored to the cognitive abilities of this population, featuring simple controls and error-based scoring system. Ten younger adults, ten cognitively healthy older adults, and ten age-matched individuals with AD participated in this study. They underwent cognitive assessments using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before gameplay. The game involves navigating a virtual environment to find a target room, with increasing levels of difficulty. This study aimed to confirm the cognitive sensitivity of the Barn Ruins' spatial learning score by studying its relationship with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. MoCA scores and spatial learning scores had a correlation coefficient of 0.755 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Logistic regression further revealed that higher spatial learning scores significantly predicted lower odds of cognitive impairment (OR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI [0.274, 0.746], p\u2009<\u20090.005). The initial results suggest that the game is effective in differentiating performance among participant groups. This research demonstrates the potential of the Barn Ruins game as an innovative tool for assessing spatial navigation in AD, highlighting areas for future validation and investigation as a training tool.",

Symptoms appear gradually, and pathological brain changes may occur twenty years before the physical and psychological signs, pointing to the urgent development of preventive interventions. Physical activity has been investigated as a preventive tool to defeat the main biological features of AD: pathological amyloid protein plaques, tau tangles, myelin degeneration, and iron deposits in the brain. This work quantifies tau tangles, amyloid, iron, and ferroptosis in oligodendrocytes in the aged rat hippocampal formation and statistically correlates neuron-neuron, neuron-glia, and glia-glia crosstalk and the effect of physical exercise on it. Our results indicate that iron overload in the oligodendrocytes is an inducer of ferroptosis; physical exercise reduces inflammaging, and improves axon-myelin volume relations; tau, amyloid, iron, and hippocampal formation cells present statistical correlations. Our data suggest the beneficial effects of physical exercise in AD and a mathematical relationship between the hippocampal formation cells in sedentary and active individuals, which should be considered in human and animal studies as a guide to a better understanding of crosstalk physiology.",

Recent research has deepened our understanding of AD heterogeneity; however, translating these insights from bench to bedside via neuroimaging heterogeneity frameworks presents significant challenges. In this review, we systematically revisit prior studies and summarize the existing methodology of data-driven neuroimaging studies for AD heterogeneity. We organized the current methodology into 1) a subtyping clustering strategy for patients with AD, and we also subdivided it into subtyping analysis based on cross-sectional multimodal neuroimaging profiles and the identification of long-term disease progression from short-term datasets; 2) a stratified strategy that integrates neuroimaging measures with biomarkers; and 3) individual-specific abnormal patterns based on the normative model. Then, we evaluated the characteristics of these studies along 2 dimensions: 1) the understanding of pathology and 2) clinical application. We systematically address the limitations, challenges, and future directions of research into AD heterogeneity. Our goal is to enhance the neuroimaging heterogeneity framework for AD, thereby facilitating its transition from bench to bedside.",

        "AbstractText": "A\u03b2-amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in the brain are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. The spreading of A\u03b2 amyloidosis in the brain appears to be mediated by a seeding mechanism, where preformed fibrils (called seeds) accelerate A\u03b2 fibril formation by bypassing the rate-determining nucleation step. Several studies have demonstrated that A\u03b2 amyloidosis can be induced in transgenic mice, producing human A\u03b2, by injecting A\u03b2-rich brain extracts (seeds) derived from transgenic mice and human AD brains. However, studies on recombinant seeds are limited. Therefore, we investigated the seeding activity of pure recombinant human A\u03b2 fibrils of different compositions. Seeds were inoculated into APP23 mice at the age of 3\u00a0months and were analyzed after 6\u00a0months of incubation. Recombinant fibril seeds made from A\u03b2-peptides with an N-terminal methionine (i.e. (preformed fibrils from A\u03b2M1-42, A\u03b2M1-40, and A\u03b2M1-40\u00a0+\u00a0A\u03b2M1-42) accelerated A\u03b2-amyloid plaque formation in vivo compared to non-inoculated transgenic control mice of the same age. In addition, all seeds induced CAA pathology. Interestingly, A\u03b2M1-42 containing seeds produced significantly more CAA and amyloid plaques than seeds containing pure A\u03b2M1-40, which was surprising given that APP23 mice produce approximately four-fold more A\u03b21-40 substrate than A\u03b21-42. This study showed that A\u03b2M1-42 fibrils are highly potent in seeding CAA and implies that conformational templating occurs in amyloid plaque as deduced by comparative amyloid ligand staining. Our results verify that recombinant A\u03b2 fibrils are transmissible amyloids, and that in vivo seeding can accelerate, and redirect A\u03b2 amyloidosis patterns compared to spontaneous age dependent amyloidosis.",

The vicious circle between amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) overgeneration and microglial dysfunction is an important pathological event that promotes AD progression. However, therapeutic strategies toward only A\u03b2 or microglial modulation still have many problems. Herein, inspired by the A\u03b2 transportation, an A\u03b2-derived peptide (CKLVFFAED) engineered biomimetic nanodelivery system (MK@PC-R NPs) is reported for realizing BBB penetration and reprogram neuron and microglia in AD lesion sites. This hollow mesoporous Prussian blue-based MK@PC-R NPs carrying curcumin and miRNA-124 can down-regulate \u03b2 secretase expression, thereby inhibiting A\u03b2 production and reducing A\u03b2-induced neurotoxicity. Meanwhile, MK@PC-R NPs with excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties could normalize the microglial phenotype and promote A\u03b2 degradation, providing neuroprotection. As expected, after treatment with MK@PC-R NPs, the A\u03b2 burdens, neuron damages, neuroinflammation, and memory deficits of transgenic AD mice (APP/PS1 mice) are significantly attenuated. Overall, this biomimetic nanodelivery system with anti-A\u03b2 and anti-inflammatory properties provides a promising strategy for the multi-target therapy of early AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Cholesterol dysregulation, disorder of neuronal membrane lipid packing, and lipid rafts lead to the synthesis and accumulation of toxic amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study shows that near-infrared (NIR) transcranial photobiomodulation therapy (tPBMT) can reduce A\u03b2 load and restore the properties of neuronal plasma membrane, including A\u03b2 production, bilayer order, rafts, lipid content, and Ca2+ channels during AD. Mice in the experiments were exposed to 808-nm LED for 1\u00a0h daily over 3\u00a0months. In the APOE transgenic model with cholesterol dysregulation, the cholesterol levels increased by 22 times, causing healthy neurons to produce toxic A\u03b2 three times faster, increasing its load by five times. Consequently, A\u03b2 disrupts the membrane bilayer and prompts the formation of lipid rafts and pores. NIR-tPBMT can nearly half attenuate A\u03b2 load, restore membrane lipid order and rigidity, reduce the number of lipid rafts, modulate cholesterol synthesis, normalize Ca2+ influx by activated endocytosis, and reduce neuronal death. The Ca2+ influx induced by light does not cause excitotoxicity but modulates Ca2+/calmodulin signaling involved in AD mechanisms and cell viability. The transcriptome analysis of the brain cortex and hippocampus shows that light can downregulate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent AD-risk genes BACE, PSEN, and APP, and normalize cholesterol homeostasis via the HMGCR, DHCR7, and INSIG1 genes. Additionally, light enhances neuron resistance to the endoplasmic reticulum stress via activating transcription factors of the unfolded protein response. Thus, red/NIR light could be promising in combating AD, restoring synaptic plasticity in degenerating neurons and reducing A\u03b2 load.",

Current procedures are often costly and invasive, lacking consideration of sex-based differences. This study introduces an explainable machine learning (ML) system to predict and differentiate the progression of AD based on sex, using non-invasive, easily collectible predictors such as neuropsychological test scores and sociodemographic data, enabling its application in every day clinical settings. The ML model uses SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to provide clear insights into its decision-making, making complex outcomes easier to interpret. The system includes a user-friendly graphical interface designed in collaboration with clinicians, supporting its integration into medical practice. The study extends the cohort to include healthy and Mild Cognitive Impairment subjects, aiming to support early diagnosis in AD pre-clinical stages. The ML system was trained on a large dataset of 2407 subjects from the ADNI open dataset, enhancing its robustness and applicability. By focusing on sex-specific features and utilizing longitudinal data, the system aims to improve prediction accuracy and early detection of AD, ultimately advancing personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Key findings highlight the significance of the Mini-Mental State Examination, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Logical Memory - Delayed Recall, and educational attainment in AD diagnosis and progression, with sex-based disparities.

Much less is known about their ability to predict risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an earlier disease stage. This study examined whether levels of blood biomarkers of amyloid (A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio), tau (p-tau181), neurodegeneration (NfL), and glial activation and neuroinflammation (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], YKL40, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 [sTREM2]) collected when participants were cognitively normal are associated with the time to onset of MCI. METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired participants from the longitudinal observational BIOCARD study provided blood plasma at their baseline evaluation (\"baseline 1\"). A second \"baseline\" specimen (collected using slightly different procedures) was evaluated for participants who were still cognitively normal approximately 7 years later. The plasma assays were based on the NeuroToolKit (cobas Elecsys assays, Roche Diagnostics). Cox regression models tested the association of biomarker levels with time to MCI symptom onset, separately for both baselines. RESULTS: Participants included 271 individuals at \"baseline 1\" (mean age = 57.5 years, 60.5% female, including 82 who progressed to MCI/dementia) and 202 individuals at \"baseline 2\" (mean age = 64.5 years, 62.4% female, including 31 progressors). The mean clinical follow-up was 15.5 years for \"baseline 1\" and 9.9 years for \"baseline 2.\" For both baselines, lower plasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio (both hazard ratios, HRs \u2264 0.69, 95% CIs \u2264 0.55-0.87, p \u2264 0.034), higher GFAP (HRs \u2265 1.83, CIs \u2265 1.28-2.60, p < 0.002), and a higher ratio of p-tau181/(A\u03b242/A\u03b240) (HRs \u2265 1.64, CIs \u2265 1.25-2.13, p \u2264 0.001) were each associated with an earlier time to MCI symptom onset. For baseline 2, higher p-tau181 (HR = 2.07, CI = 1.12-3.83, p = 0.021) and higher NfL (HR = 1.75, CI = 0.99-3.10, p = 0.05) were also associated with earlier MCI symptom onset for progression within 7 years. When combining biomarkers, neither GFAP nor NFL was associated with MCI symptom onset after accounting for AD biomarker levels (e.g., p-tau181/(A\u03b242/A\u03b240)), which remained significant. YKL40 and sTREM2 were not associated with MCI onset. DISCUSSION: Results indicate that during preclinical AD, more abnormal blood biomarker levels of amyloid (A\u03b242/A\u03b240), p-tau181, neurodegeneration (NfL), and neuroinflammation (GFAP) individually are associated with progression from normal cognition to MCI, but the AD-nonspecific neurodegeneration and inflammation markers were not associated with symptom onset after accounting for amyloid and p-tau levels.",

        "AbstractText": "pH and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) are two critical biomarkers to unveil the corresponding status of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are closely related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Simultaneously monitoring pH and ONOO- fluctuations in the ER and mitochondria during AD progression is pivotal for clarifying the interplay between the disorders of the two organelles and revealing AD pathogenesis. Herein, we designed and synthesized a dual-channel fluorescent probe (DCFP) to visualize pH and ONOO- in the ER and mitochondria. DCFP possessed excellent sensitivity and selectivity to pH and ONOO- without spectral crosstalk and was utilized in monitoring the two analytes within AD model cells and larval zebrafish. Importantly, DCFP could preferentially target mitochondria in normal cells and be enriched in the ER after mitochondrial depolarization. With the aid of DCFP, the slower acidification rate of the ER than that of mitochondria induced by A\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2Os) was first identified, which could be ascribed to the relief of the A\u03b2Os-triggered ER stress through the Ca2+ migration from the ER to mitochondria. Moreover, continuous exposure to A\u03b2Os led to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, accelerating the acidification and ONOO- overproduction within mitochondria. As a result, intracellular oxidative stress levels were elevated, further exacerbating ER stress and aggravating ER acidification in turn. The advanced understanding of the potential interplay between the ER and mitochondria in this work may offer new insights and methodologies for studying AD pathogenesis. The DCFP developed in this work could also be employed to study other diseases related to ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide. AD brains are characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 peptides (A\u03b2) that bind Cu2+ and have been associated with several neurotoxic mechanisms. Although the use of copper chelators to prevent the formation of Cu2+-A\u03b2 complexes has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy, recent studies show that copper is an important neuromodulator that is essential for a neuroprotective mechanism mediated by Cu2+ binding to the cellular prion protein (PrPC). Therefore, in addition to metal selectivity and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, an emerging challenge for copper chelators is to prevent the formation of neurotoxic Cu2+-A\u03b2 species without perturbing the neuroprotective Cu2+-PrPC interaction. Previously, we reported the design of a tetrapeptide (TP) that withdraws Cu2+ from A\u03b2(1-16) and impacts the Cu2+-induced aggregation of A\u03b2(1-40). In this study, we improved the drug-like properties of TP in a BBB model, evaluated the metal selectivity of the optimized peptide (TP*), and tested its effect on Cu2+ coordination to PrPC and proteins involved in copper trafficking, such as copper transporter 1 and albumin. Our results show that changing the stereochemistry of the first residue prevents TP degradation in the BBB model and coadministration of TP with a peptide that increases BBB permeability allows its passage through the BBB model. TP* is highly selective toward Cu2+ in the presence of Zn2+ ions, transfers Cu2+ to copper-trafficking proteins, and forms a ternary TP*-Cu2+-PrP species that does not perturb the physiological conformation of PrP and displays only a minor impact in the neuroprotective Cu2+-dependent interaction of PrPC with the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. Overall, these results show that TP* displays desirable features for a copper chelator with therapeutic potential against AD. Moreover, this is the first study that explores the effect of a Cu2+ chelator with therapeutic potential for AD on Cu2+ coordination to PrPC (an emerging key player in AD pathology), integrating recent knowledge about metalloproteins involved in AD with the design of copper chelators against AD.",

The CSF p-tau/A\u03b242 ratio, a biomarker combining information from both pathophysiological processes, has emerged as a promising tool for monitoring disease progression, even at pre-clinical stages. Here, we studied the association between the CSF p-tau/A\u03b242 ratio with downstream markers of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease progression including brain structure, glucose metabolism, fibrillary A\u03b2 deposition and cognitive performance in 234 cognitively unimpaired individuals, who underwent cognitive testing, a lumbar puncture, MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-flutemetamol PET scanning. We evaluated both main effects and interactions with Alzheimer's disease risk factors, such as older age, female sex and the apoliporoptein E (APOE)-\u025b4 allele, in a priori defined regions of interest and further examined the associations on the whole-brain using voxel-wise regressions. In addition, as the association between CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and brain structure and function may be non-linear, we tested the interaction between the CSF p-tau/A\u03b242 ratio and stages of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease defined using the amyloid (A) and tau (T) classification. We found significantly positive associations between CSF p-tau/A\u03b242 and both cortical A\u03b2 deposition and regional grey matter volume while no effect was observed for brain metabolism. A significant interaction with age indicated that, for the same level of CSF p-tau/A\u03b242, older individuals displayed both increased A\u03b2 deposition and lower grey matter volume, in widespread cortical areas. In addition, we found that women compared with men had a greater A\u03b2 fibrillary accumulation in midline cortical areas and inferior temporal regions, for the same level of the CSF biomarker. The impact of CSF p-tau/A\u03b242 on grey matter volume was modulated by AT stages, with A+T+ individuals displaying significantly less positive associations in areas of early atrophy in the Alzheimer's continuum. Finally, we found that sex and APOE-\u025b4 modulated the association between the CSF biomarker and episodic memory as well as abstract reasoning, respectively. Our data indicate that the CSF p-tau/A\u03b242 ratio is strongly associated with multiple downstream neuropathological events in cognitively unimpaired individuals and may thus serve as a potent biomarker to investigate the earliest changes in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease. Given that its impact on both A\u03b2 deposition and grey matter volume is modulated by specific risk factors, our results highlight the need to take into account such predisposing variables in both clinical practice and prevention trials.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Quantitative global or regional brain imaging measurements, known as imaging-specific or -derived phenotypes (IDPs), are commonly used in genotype-phenotype association studies to explore the genomic architecture of the brain and how it may be affected by neurological diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), mental health (e.g., depression), and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]). For this purpose, medical images have been used as IDPs using a voxel-wise or global approach via principal component analysis. However, these methods have limitations related to multiple testing or the inability to isolate high variation regions, respectively. METHODS: To address these limitations, this study investigates a localized, principal component analysis-like approach for dimensionality reduction of cross-sectional T1-weighted MRI datasets utilizing diffeomorphic morphometry. This approach can reduce the dimensionality of images while preserving spatial information and enables the inclusion of spatial locality in the analysis. In doing so, this method can be used to explore morphometric brain changes across specific components and spatial scales of interest and to identify associations with genome regions in a multivariate genome-wide association study. For a first clinical feasibility study, this method was applied to data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, including adolescents with ADHD (n = 1,359), obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 1,752), and depression (n = 1,766). RESULTS: Meaningful associations of specific morphometric features with genome regions were identified with the data and corresponded to previous found brain regions in the respective mental health and neurodevelopmental disorder cohorts. DISCUSSION: In summary, the localized, principal component analysis-like approach can reduce the dimensionality of medical images while still being able to identify meaningful local brain region alterations that are associated with genomic markers across multiple scales. The proposed method can be applied to various image types and can be easily integrated in many genotype-phenotype association study setups.",

In some cases, such as cataract development and diabetes, clear links between nPTMs, aging, and disease progression have been established. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, a key question is whether accumulation of nPTMs is a cause or consequence of protein aggregation. This review focuses on major nPTMs found on proteins with central roles in neurodegenerative diseases such as \u03b1-synuclein, \u03b2-amyloid, and tau. We summarize current knowledge on the formation of these modifications and discuss their potential impact on disease onset and progression. Additionally, we examine what is known to date about how nPTMs impair cellular detoxification, repair, and degradation systems. Finally, we critically discuss the available methodologies to systematically investigate nPTMs at the molecular level and outline suitable approaches to study their effects on protein aggregation. We aim to foster more research into the role of nPTMs in neurodegeneration by adapting methodologies that have proven successful in studying enzymatic posttranslational modifications. Specifically, we advocate for site-specific incorporation of these modifications into target proteins using advanced chemical and molecular biology techniques.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and incidence of dementia in patients with non-overtly functional adrenal tumours (NOFATs). DESIGN: A national retrospective register-based study was conducted on patients diagnosed with NOFAT and controls diagnosed between 2005 and 2019, in Sweden. Individuals diagnosed with overt adrenal hormone excess or previous malignancies were excluded. Sensitivity analyses were performed in subgroups with a combination of gallbladder/biliary tract/pancreatic disease. and acute appendicitis, as well as 3- and 12-months of malignancy-free survival. MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence and incidence of dementia. The secondary outcomes were Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. RESULTS: Among 20,390 cases, 12,120 (59.4%) were women, and the median (IQR) age was 66 (57-73) years. Among the 125,392 controls, 69,994 (55.8%) were women and the median (IQR) age was 66 (57-73) years. Patients with NOFATs had a lower prevalence of dementia compared to controls (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% CI 0.50-0.68, adjusted OR [aOR] 0.47, 95% CI 0.40-0.56). During the follow-up period (median 4.9 years, IQR 2.2-8.2), incidence of dementia was similar in NOFATs and controls (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.15, adjusted HR [aHR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.97-1.15). Similar results obtained for Alzheimer's dementia (aOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.34-0.57; aHR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10) and vascular dementia (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.94, aOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35-0.64; HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08-1.53, aHR 1.13, 95% CI 0.95-1.35) as well as in the sensitivity analyses. Adrenalectomy did not change the results. CONCLUSION: NOFAT was not associated with an increased risk of dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "The effect of digestion on nanocarriers will affect the release and pharmacological effects of bioactive compounds in delivery systems. The digestion of cellulose is limited to gut microbiota, which offers a new research strategy for targeted delivery of bioactive compounds. Herein, positively charged cellulose-like chitosan/polyvinylpyrrolidone nanofiber was prepared to improve the residence time, colon target and gut microbiota regulation activity of quercetin decorated selenium nanoparticles (QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs). Selenium nanoparticles block the degradation of quercetin and QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs only decompose when caused by chitosanase secretion from gut microbiota. In vivo imaging showed that the residence time of QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs was longer than that of QUE@SeNPs. Thus, it significantly decreased the lipid concentrations in liver, which further inhibited insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs treatment improves gut barrier integrity, increased the relative abundance of anti-obesity and anti-inflammation related bacterial including Akkermansia, Lactobacillus and Bacteroides. Consequently, the inflammatory factor (IL-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) levels in gut, liver and brain were also decreased. Nissl and PSD-95 staining indicated that QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs ameliorated synapse dysfunction in the brain. Therefore, QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs has a greater effect than QUE@SeNPs in improving cognitive ability in Morris water maze. Overall, QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs with prolonged residence time attenuates cognitive disorder via gut-liver-brain axis in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "The deposition of aggregated amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) is considered as a key factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Previously, we demonstrated that a carboxylated Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) inhibits A\u03b2 fibril formation, consequently protects neurons in culture. This study evaluated the effects of ZnPc on pathological changes in an AD mouse model (J20). Nine-month-old J20 mice received weekly intraperitoneal injection of ZnPc (2 and 4\u00a0mg/kg) for 12\u00a0weeks. Cognitive performance was assessed using Y-maze and open field tests. ZnPc levels in the tissues were evaluated using near-infrared microscopy and spectroscopy. ZnPc accumulated primarily in the liver and kidney. A considerable amount was also detected in brain tissue, where it co-localized with neurons, microglia, and extracellularly deposited A\u03b2. ZnPc treatment (2\u00a0mg/kg) significantly improved cognitive functions of J20 mice. Immunostaining results showed that A\u03b2 was positive intracellularly in neurons, and extracellularly around the vessels and parenchyma in the cortex and hippocampus of PBS-treated J20 mice, which was significantly decreased in ZnPc-treated J20 mice in a dose-dependent manner. Nissl staining demonstrated that neuronal numbers were increased both in the cortex and hippocampus. GFAP-positive astrocytes and Iba-1 positive microglia were decreased by ZnPc treatment. Also, vessel numbers were increased in ZnPc-treated groups. In PBS-treated group, aquaporin 4 immunopositive area extended beyond STL-positive vessels into the parenchyma, which was confined primarily around the vessels in the ZnPc-treated group. Claudin 5 levels were increased in ZnPc-treated group. Therefore, ZnPc can decrease brain A\u03b2 deposition in J20 mice, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic agent for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the predominant form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by a subtle onset and a spectrum of cognitive and functional declines. The clinical manifestation of AD encompasses memory deficits, cognitive deterioration, and behavioral disturbances, culminating in a severe impairment of daily living skills. Despite its high prevalence, accounting for 60-70% of all dementia cases, there remains an absence of curative therapeutics. Microglia (MG), the resident immune cells of the CNS, exhibit a bifurcated role in AD pathogenesis. Functioning in a neuroprotective capacity, MGs express scavenger receptors, facilitating the clearance of [Formula: see text]-amyloid protein (A[Formula: see text]) and cellular debris. Conversely, aberrant activation of MGs can lead to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby propagating neuroinflammatory responses that are detrimental to neuronal integrity. The dynamics of MG activation and the ensuing neuroinflammation are pivotal in the evolution of AD. Chinese medicine (CM), a treasure trove of traditional Chinese cultural practices, has demonstrated significant potential in the therapeutic management of AD. Over the past triennium, CM has garnered considerable research attention for its multifaceted approaches to AD, including the regulation of MG polarization. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the origins, polarization dynamics, and mechanistic interplay of MG with AD pathology. It further explores the nexus between MG polarization and cardinal pathological hallmarks of AD, such as A[Formula: see text] plaque deposition, hyperphosphorylation of tau, synaptic plasticity impairments, neuroinflammation, and brain-gut-axis dysregulation. The review also encapsulates the therapeutic strategies of CM, which encompass monomers, formulae, and acupuncture. These strategies modulate MG polarization in the context of AD treatment, thereby providing a robust theoretical framework in which to conduct future investigative endeavors in both the clinical and preclinical realms.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is one of the primary contributors to the pathogenesis of AD. Withanolides, the main constituents in the leaves of Datura stramonium L., exhibit anti-neuroinflammatory activity. It is unknown if total withanolide from Datura stramonium L. leaves (TWD) reduces nerve inflammation and potentially mitigates the pathogenic elements of AD. This study examined the potential effects of TWD on neuroinflammation in triple transgenic AD (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Tg-AD) mice and LPS-induced BV-2, as well as associated signaling pathways. HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used in this study to examine the main chemical components of the TWD extract. 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Tg-AD as in vivo AD models and LPS induce BV-2 cells in vitro AD models. The molecular process was investigated by ELISA, WB, IHC, and IF. In 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Tg-AD mice, TWD dramatically ameliorates cognitive impairment. Treatment with TWD can counteract the increased activation of microglia and A\u03b2 deposits observed in 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Tg-AD mice. Further research indicates that TWD can enhance TOM 1 and mitigate inflammatory responses by reducing the levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL1R1, and IL-18. Additionally, TWD may inhibit neuroinflammation through the pathways of IL1R1/MyD88/NF-\u03baB and NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1. In summary, this study reveals for the first time that TWD effectively improves cognitive deficits in 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Tg-AD mice by modulating the IL1R1/MyD88/NF-\u03baB and NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 pathways. It also alleviates excessive activation of microglia and suppresses A\u03b2 accumulation. Therefore, TWD has the potential as a therapeutic agent for AD.",

However, it is unknown whether PVS can predict dementia risk and brain atrophy trajectories in participants without dementia, as longitudinal studies on PVS are scarce and current methods for PVS assessment lack robustness and inter-scanner reproducibility. METHODS: We developed a robust algorithm to automatically assess PVS count and size on clinical MRI, and investigated 1) their relationship with dementia risk and brain atrophy in participants without dementia, 2) their longitudinal evolution, and 3) their potential use as a screening tool in simulated clinical trials. We analysed 46,478 clinical measurements of cognitive functioning and 20,845 brain MRI scans from 10,004 participants (71.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.7 years-old, 56.6% women) from three publicly available observational studies on ageing and dementia (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre database, and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). Clinical and MRI data collected between 2004 and 2022 were analysed with consistent methods, controlling for confounding factors, and combined using mixed-effects models. FINDINGS: Our fully-automated method for PVS assessment showed excellent inter-scanner reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.8). Fewer PVS and larger PVS diameter at baseline predicted higher dementia risk and accelerated brain atrophy. Longitudinal trajectories of PVS markers differed significantly in participants without dementia who converted to dementia compared with non-converters. In simulated placebo-controlled trials for treatments targeting cognitive decline, screening out participants at low risk of dementia based on our PVS markers enhanced the power of the trial independently of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. INTERPRETATION: These robust cerebrovascular markers predict dementia risk and brain atrophy and may improve risk-stratification of patients, potentially reducing cost and increasing throughput of clinical trials to combat dementia.

We investigate Single-Metal (SM), Dual-Metal (DM), and Tri-Metal Double Gate (DG) configurations, where cavities have been created by etching the oxide layer underneath the gate to immobilize grey matter samples collected through Solid-phase microextraction (SPME). Healthy and AD-affected grey matter have different dielectric characteristics at high frequencies. The dielectric constant of the etched nanocavities changes when the sample, which was formerly filled with air, is immobilized in the nanocavities. The alteration in the device drain current as well as performance at 2.4\u00a0GHz has been connected to the specimen's modified dielectric constant. To distinguish between the grey matter samples from AD patients and healthy individuals, the ION/IOFF of the suggested device along with the variation in device drain current, has been utilized as the foundation for the identification. The SM configuration has been examined by varying the cavity orientation and gate oxide stacking. To monitor the functioning of the suggested devices, the gate metal of the DM and TM devices has been altered, and a comparison has been made between SM, DM, and TM structures.

An underrepresented population in AD research, Latinos will be disproportionately affected by AD in the coming decades. To better aid efforts in education and genetic risk counseling for Latino populations, we must first understand the anticipated psychological and behavioral consequences of APOE genetic risk counseling. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 216 Latinos between the ages of 40 and 64 (average age\u2009=\u200953 years) in northern Manhattan to ascertain their hypothetical reactions to learning that they had a higher risk of developing AD compared to other Latinos within their community. Responses were categorized as emotional, practical, and mixed responses. Among our sample, women were more likely to anticipate an emotional response to hearing that they had a higher risk of AD, and participants above the age of 60 were more likely to anticipate disclosing their risk information to immediate family members.

Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. However, traditional diagnostic tools, such as MRI and PET scans, are costly and less accessible. This study aims to develop an automated, cost-effective digital diagnostic approach using deep learning (DL) and computer-aided detection (CAD) methods for early AD identification and classification. METHODS: The proposed framework utilizes pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, integrated with two classifiers: multi-class support vector machine (MSVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). A dataset categorized into four groups-non-demented, very mild demented, mild demented, and moderate demented-was employed for evaluation. To optimize the classification process, a texture-based algorithm was applied for feature reduction, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing processing time. RESULTS: The system demonstrated high statistical performance, achieving an accuracy of 91%, precision of 95%, and recall of 90%. Among the initial set of twenty-two texture features, seven were identified as particularly effective in differentiating normal cases from mild AD stages, significantly streamlining the classification process. These results validate the robustness and efficacy of the proposed DL-based CAD system. CONCLUSION: This study presents a reliable and affordable solution for early AD detection and diagnosis. The proposed system outperforms existing state-of-the-art models and offers a valuable tool for timely treatment planning.

In this study, we performed cross-sectional surveys using large-scale patient and caregiver data to identify the prevalence and average impact of symptoms and symptomatic themes experienced by adults with AD, MCI, and dementia. Subsequent analyses were used to determine which demographic and disease-specific factors are associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Fifteen adults with AD (6), MCI (8), and dementia (1) and 15 caregivers of adults with AD (7), MCI (6), and dementia (2) participated in qualitative interviews providing 1,166 and 1,097 unique quotes pertaining to symptom burden. Using open-ended questions from a comprehensive interview guide, participants were asked to identify the symptoms of AD that have the greatest effect on their lives or the lives of the individual for whom they provide care. A cross-sectional survey was then implemented inquiring about the potential symptoms of importance identified during preliminary qualitative interviews. Four-hundred thirty-three individuals (patients and caregivers) participated in the cross-sectional survey, providing more than 35,000 symptom rating responses. Subsequent analyses were conducted to determine how demographic and disease-specific characteristics correlate with symptomatic theme prevalence. RESULTS: The most frequent symptomatic themes reported by individuals with AD, MCI, and dementia in the cross-sectional survey were memory problems (99.0%), problems thinking (90.3%), and communication difficulties (80.4%). Patients identified decreased satisfaction in social situations (1.45), fatigue (1.45), and memory problems (1.41) as the most impactful symptomatic themes (range 0-4). Patient-reported symptomatic theme prevalence was strongly associated with the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for neurologic disability.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: This systematic review analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on dementia patients' functional, cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and health related outcomes. It hypothesizes that dementia patients infected with SARS-CoV-2experience more pronounced deterioration compared to those who are uninfected. METHODS: Research from 01/03/2020 to 07/10/2023 was conducted using Medline, Web of Science, and Embase databases, and adhering to PRISMA guidelines and the PICO framework. The study aimed to determine if SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with worse outcomes in dementia patients. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022352481), and bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Among 198 studies reviewed, only three met the criteria. Chen et al. (2023) identified higher mortality in SARS-CoV-2-infected dementia patients, while Merla et al. (2023) observed faster cognitive decline in infected individuals with increased hospital admissions. Additionally, Cascini et al. (2022) reported an increased risk of infection and significantly elevated mortality in dementia patients, highlighting comorbidities and antipsychotic medication use as key risk factors. CONCLUSION: These limited data suggest higher mortality and cognitive decline in dementia patients following COVID-19, underscoring the need for extensive research in this area.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), including transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), is widely studied for its potential to modulate brain oscillations and connectivity, offering treatment options for neurological disorders like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and insomnia. In this study, we focus on investigating the efficacy of tACS and tDCS in entraining intrinsic cortical network oscillations through a computational model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a 2D computational cortical neuron model with 2000 neurons (1600 pyramidal and 400 inhibitory), based on the Izhikevich neuron model. The network was structured to generate low-frequency oscillations, particularly within the delta (4\u00a0Hz) range. Both tACS and tDCS were simulated to assess their effect on network synchronization. An algorithm was employed to extract the network's intrinsic frequency and align stimulation frequencies accordingly. RESULTS: Our model successfully generated 4\u00a0Hz oscillations, characteristic of delta waves, associated with sleep states. t-ACS stimulation enhanced the power of the 4\u00a0Hz frequency, achieving effective synchronization with the intrinsic network dynamics. In contrast, tDCS failed to increase the power of 4\u00a0Hz oscillations and disrupted the excitatory-inhibitory balance of the network, reducing connectivity and synchronization. Our results demonstrate that tACS effectively enhances network synchronization and maintains excitatory-inhibitory balance by aligning with the network's intrinsic oscillatory frequency. In contrast, tDCS disrupts these dynamics, reducing connectivity and failing to entrain the target frequency. These findings suggest that tACS may hold greater potential for applications requiring precise network synchronization, while tDCS may have distinct but more limited efficacy in influencing oscillatory activity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the superior efficacy of tACS over tDCS in enhancing the synchronization of cortical networks by entraining intrinsic frequencies. Future research may extend this model by incorporating long-term plasticity mechanisms to better understand tES effects over longer time scales.",

However, the accurate detection of glycosylated amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) proteins, which serve as important biomarkers for AD, remains challenging due to their extremely low levels. To address these issues, we proposed a method for fabricating a flexible and stable sensor platform based on an innovative boronic acid-based covalent organic framework COF-B(OH)2. After in situ formation on carbon cloth (CC) by facile interfacial perturbation, this CC-based COF substrate could further serve as an electrochemical platform for detecting glycosylated-A\u03b216 via molecular interactions. The substrate offers abundant molecular recognition sites, a large specific surface area, and excellent electrical conductivity. Furthermore, poly(thymine)-templated copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) linked to the aptamer of glycosylated-A\u03b216 were employed as electrochemical probes, providing an amplified signal. The proposed assay for the detection of glycosylated-A\u03b216 proteins demonstrated a wide detection range of 5-1800\u00a0pg/mL, with an ultralow detection limit of 0.32\u00a0pg/mL and high stability.

Yet, the mechanisms by which microglia can drive neurodegeneration remain unresolved. Here, we discover that a conserved stress signaling pathway, the integrated stress response (ISR), characterizes a microglia subset with neurodegenerative outcomes. Autonomous activation of ISR in microglia is sufficient to induce early features of the ultrastructurally distinct \"dark microglia\" linked to pathological synapse loss. In AD models, microglial ISR activation exacerbates neurodegenerative pathologies and synapse loss while its inhibition ameliorates them. Mechanistically, we present evidence that ISR activation promotes the secretion of toxic lipids by microglia, impairing neuron homeostasis and survival in\u00a0vitro. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of ISR or lipid synthesis mitigates synapse loss in AD models. Our results demonstrate that microglial ISR activation represents a neurodegenerative phenotype, which may be sustained, at least in part, by the secretion of toxic lipids.",

Microglial proliferation, differentiation, and survival are highly dependent on the CSF-1 signaling pathway, which can be pharmacologically modulated by inhibiting its receptor, CSF-1R. Pharmacological inhibition of CSF-1R leads to an almost complete microglial depletion whereas treatment arrest allows for subsequent repopulation. Microglial depletion has shown promising results in many animal models of neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis) where transitory microglial depletion reduced neuroinflammation and improved behavioral test results. In this review, we will focus on the comparison of three different pharmacological CSF-1R inhibitors (PLX3397, PLX5622, and GW2580) regarding microglial depletion. We will also highlight the promising results obtained by microglial depletion strategies in adult models of neurological disorders and argue they could also prove promising in neurodevelopmental diseases associated with microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Finally, we will discuss the lack of knowledge about the effects of these strategies on neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in adults and during neurodevelopment.",

However, the animal models for studying HS are relatively scarce. METHODS: CRISPR/Cas-mediated genetic engineering was used to generate targeted knockout offspring mice (C57BL/6J). Different doses (10\u00a0mg/kg, 20\u00a0mg/kg, and 30\u00a0mg/kg) and injection methods (subcutaneous/intraperitoneal/gavage injection) of tamoxifen were used to induce the construction of NCSTN knockout mice (mice model). The expressions of nicastrin, NICD1, hes1 in skin, brain, and liver tissue in mice model and wild-type (WT) mice were measured by qRT-PCR and IHC. RESULTS: The construction of mice model was successfully induced by tamoxifen, knockout efficiency was 93%, there was no difference in knockout efficiency among three doses, injection methods, genders (P\u2009>\u20090.05). HS-like lesions appeared on the skin of NCSTN knockout mice after 1\u00a0month of treatment with tamoxifen, male mice had a higher number of skin lesions compared to female mice (male vs female\u2009=\u200976.5% vs 41.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.027). Compared with WT mice, the expressions of nicastrin (skin P\u2009=\u20090.0009, brain P\u2009=\u20090.0194, liver P\u2009=\u20090.0066), NICD1 (skin P\u2009=\u20090.0115, brain P\u2009=\u20090.0307, liver P\u2009=\u20090.008), hes1 (skin P\u2009=\u20090.0476, brain P\u2009=\u20090.0143, liver P\u2009=\u20090.0003) in mice model all decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The NCSTN knockout mouse might be employed as HS animal model; Reducing nicastrin may affect the expression of notch1-hes1 pathway molecules in skin, brain, and liver tissues; low dose (10\u00a0mg/kg/d) tamoxifen could be used to induce the deletion of the target gene in mice.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that affects 47.5\u00a0million people worldwide. AD is characterised by the formation of plaques containing extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins (pTau). A\u03b2 gradually accumulates in the brain up to 20\u00a0years before the clinical onset of dementia, making it a compelling candidate for early detection of AD. It has been shown that there is increased deposition of A\u03b2s in AD patients' retinas. However, little is known about microglia's ability to function and clear A\u03b2 within the retina of AD and control eyes. We labelled microglia with ionised calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1) in AD and age-matched control donor retinas. We then used interactive machine learning to segment individual microglia in 3D. In the temporal mid-peripheral region, we found that the number of microglia was significantly lower in AD retinas compared to controls. Unexpectedly, the size of the microglia was significantly larger in the AD retinas compared to controls. We also labelled retinal microglia for Cluster of Differentiation 68 (CD68), a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by cells in the monocyte lineage and a marker of phagocytic activity and activated microglia. The size of CD68\u2009+\u2009cells was statistically different between AD and control microglial, with CD68\u2009+\u2009cells being larger in AD. In contrast, there was no difference in either size or shape for CD68- microglia between the two groups, suggesting an important difference in the active states of CD68\u2009+\u2009microglia in AD retina. There was also significantly increased CD68 immunoreactivity in individual microglia within the AD group. Overall, this study reveals unique differences in the size and activity of the retinal microglia, which may relate to their potential chronic activation due to increased levels of A\u03b2s in the AD retina.",

Even with extensive research and studies, presently, there is no effective treatment for the management of AD. Besides, most of drugs used in the treatment of AD did not avert the AD neuropathology, and the disease still in a progressive status. For example, acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors are associated with many adverse effects, such as insomnia and nightmares. As well, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors augment cholinergic neurotransmission leading to the development of adverse effects related to high acetylcholine level, such as salivation, rhinorrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and seizure. Furthermore, tacrine has poor bioavailability and causes hepatotoxicity. These commonly used drugs do not manage the original causes of AD. For those reasons, natural products were repurposed for the treatment of AD and neurodegenerative diseases. It has been shown that phytochemicals produce neuroprotective effects against the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases by different mechanisms, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Quercetin (QCN) has been reported to exert an effective neuroprotective effect against AD and other neurodegenerative diseases by lessening oxidative stress. In this review, electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for possible relevant studies and article linking the effect of QCN on AD. Findings from this review highlighted that many studies highlighted different mechanistic signaling pathways regarding the neuroprotective effect of QCN in AD.

We have developed a series of targeted mice expressing frontotemporal-dementia-causing mutations in the humanized MAPT gene to investigate the earliest stages of tauopathy.

Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau was accompanied by neurite degeneration, loss of viable synapses and indicators of behavioral abnormalities.

However, the precise mechanisms of their molecular functions within the A\u03b2 aggregation cascade have not been clarified so far. This research aimed to uncover the structural and functional characteristics of globular-shaped A\u03b2 oligomers (gA\u03b2O) under in vitro conditions. We performed thioflavin T (ThT) assays on low-molecular-weight (LMW) A\u03b242, testing different concentrations of A\u03b242 mature fibril (MF) seeds and gA\u03b2O. Fibril formation was continuously observed using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) in LMW A\u03b242 with different sample conditions. Conformational changes of A\u03b242 aggregates in the presence of gA\u03b2O was also evaluated using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results of the ThT analysis and HS-AFM observation indicated that gA\u03b2O promoted fibril formation of LMW A\u03b242 while gA\u03b2O itself did not form fibrous aggregates, indicating that gA\u03b2O would have a catalytic effects on LMW A\u03b242 aggregation. We also showed that the molecular interaction of gA\u03b2O was altered by the presence and amount of MF seeds in the reaction buffers, indicating that complex interactions would exist among different A\u03b2 species. The results of our present research demonstrated that gA\u03b2O would have significant roles to accelerate A\u03b2 aggregation in AD pathogenesis. 225\u00a0<\u00a0250 words.",

These caregivers may experience high levels of financial, mental, and physical strain associated with providing care. CareVirtue is a web-based tool created to connect and support multiple individuals across a care network to coordinate care activities and share important information, thereby reducing care burden. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use a computational informatics approach to thematically analyze open text written by AD/ADRD caregivers in the CareVirtue platform. We then explore relationships between identified themes and use patterns. METHODS: We analyzed journal posts (n=1555 posts; 170,212 words) generated by 51 unique users of the CareVirtue platform. Latent themes were identified using a neural network approach to topic modeling. We calculated a sentiment score for each post using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner. We then examined relationships between identified topics; semantic sentiment; and use-related data, including post word count and self-reported mood. RESULTS: We identified 5 primary topics in users' journal posts, including descriptions of specific events, professional and medical care, routine daily activities, nighttime symptoms, and bathroom/toileting issues. This 5-topic model demonstrated adequate fit to the data, having the highest coherence score (0.41) among those tested. We observed group differences across these topics in both word count and semantic sentiment. Further, posts made in the evening were both longer and more semantically positive than other times of the day. CONCLUSIONS: Users of the CareVirtue platform journaled about a variety of different topics, including generalized experiences and specific behavioral symptomology of AD/ADRD, suggesting a desire to record and share broadly across the care network.

RESULTS: Among 783 patients included (54.0% female, median age 48\u00a0years [IQR 33-64], median BMI 24.7\u00a0kg/m2 [IQR 21.8-28.3], 111 [14.2%] receiving APT), complications were observed in 182 (23.2%) patients.

Therapy with AAMAs requires that candidates be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, have elevated brain amyloid-\u03b2, have good physical, psychiatric, and medical health, and lack clinical or biomarker evidence of potentially impactful non-Alzheimer brain disorders. The first three diagnostic activities are the core of the Clinical Practice Guidelines, but the last element of the precision diagnosis requires new decision-making tools for recognizing multi-etiology cognitive impairment. Within the context of shared decision-making between clinician, patient, and family, proper diagnosis is essential. In addition to discussing the benefits and risks of AAMA therapy, the experienced clinician must empathetically assist in bridging the gap between expectations of benefit and the patient's overall diagnostic suitability for AAMA therapy. HIGHLIGHTS: In order to prescribe an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) to the right patients, those selected for treatment should be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, have elevated brain amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), and have good physical, psychiatric, or medical health. Persons with Alzheimer's biology as the primary etiology are the ideal AAMA treatment recipients. A novel activity necessary to optimize therapeutic response is to exclude persons with clinical or biomarker evidence of alternative contributory brain disorders. While mild clinical severity and elevated brain amyloid-\u03b2 are essential elements for selecting patients for AAMA treatment, clinical judgment is required to weigh the implications of more advanced disease severity, other medical co-morbidities, and the presence of other contributory neuropathologies.",

In 2-month-old male and female mice, we measured non-esterified (free) PUFA/oxylipin profiles using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and characterized microglia morphology via immunohistochemistry. The hypothalamus and hippocampus exhibit a different free PUFA/oxylipin profile, independent of sex. The hippocampus was characterized by a higher density of complex Iba1+ microglial cells than the hypothalamus, without sex effects. Hypothalamic microglial morphology correlated more strongly with free PUFA- and oxylipin species than hippocampal microglia, correlating with species from both the N-3 and N-6 PUFA metabolization pathways, while hippocampal microglial parameters correlated only with N-6 pathway-related species. Our findings provide a basis for future studies to investigate the relationship between PUFAs, their derivatives and neuroinflammation in the context of diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "MS4A (membrane-spanning 4-domain, subfamily A) molecules are categorized into tetraspanins, which possess four-transmembrane structures. To date, eighteen MS4A members have been identified in humans, whereas twenty-three different molecules have been identified in mice. MS4A proteins are selectively expressed on the surfaces of various immune cells, such as B cells (MS4A1), mast cells (MS4A2), macrophages (MS4A4A), Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T cells (MS4A4B), and type 3 innate lymphoid cells (TMEM176A and TMEM176B). Early research confirmed that most MS4A molecules function as ion channels that regulate the transport of calcium ions. Recent studies have revealed that some MS4A proteins also function as chaperones that interact with various immune molecules, such as pattern recognition receptors and/or immunoglobulin receptors, to form immune complexes and transmit downstream signals, leading to cell activation, growth, and development. Evidence from preclinical animal models and human genetic studies suggests that the MS4A superfamily plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer, infection, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases and autoimmune diseases. We review recent progress in this field and focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which different MS4A molecules regulate the progression of tumors, Alzheimer's disease, and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, in-depth research into MS4A superfamily members may clarify their ability to act as candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets for these diseases. Eighteen distinct members of the MS4A (membrane-spanning four-domain subfamily A) superfamily of four-transmembrane proteins have been identified in humans, whereas the MS4A genes are translated into twenty-three different molecules in mice. These proteins are selectively expressed on the surface of various immune cells, such as B cells (MS4A1), macrophages (MS4A4A), mast cells (MS4A2), Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T cells (MS4A4B), type 3 innate lymphoid cells (TMEM176A and TMEM176B) and colonic epithelial cells (MS4A12). Functionally, most MS4A molecules function as ion channels that regulate the flow of calcium ions [Ca2+] across cell membranes. Recent studies have revealed that some MS4A proteins also act as molecular chaperones and interact with various types of immune receptors, including pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and immunoglobulin receptors (IgRs), to form signaling complexes, thereby modulating intracellular signaling and cellular activity. Evidence from preclinical animal models and human genetic studies suggests that MS4A proteins play critical roles in various diseases (2). Therefore, we reviewed the recent progress in understanding the role of the MS4A superfamily in diseases, particularly in elucidating its function as a candidate biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "SIGNIFICANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a predominant form of dementia that can lead to a decline in the quality of life and mortality. The understanding of the pathological changes requires monitoring of multiple cerebral biomarkers simultaneously with high resolution. Photoacoustic microscopy resolves single capillaries, allowing investigations into the most affected types of vessels. Combined with confocal fluorescence microscopy, the relationship between plaque deposition and small vessel pathology could be better understood. AIM: We aim to introduce a dual-modality imaging system combining photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) to provide a comprehensive view of both cerebral cortical vessels and amyloid- \u03b2  ( A \u03b2  ) plaque in AD mouse model in vivo and to identify the pathological changes of these two biomarkers. APPROACH: We developed a dual-modality imaging system to image both cerebral vessel structure and A \u03b2  plaque on groups of mice with different ages and phenotypes. Vessel imaging is enabled by PAM, whereas A \u03b2  plaque is imaged by CFM with the aid of fluorescent dye. RESULTS: The small vessel density in the AD group was significantly lower than in the control group, whereas the A \u03b2  plaque density in the AD group was not only higher but also increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: This dual-modality system provides a powerful platform for biomarker monitoring of AD expressing multi-dimensional pathological changes.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cerebral amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and disruption of large-scale brain networks (LSBNs). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a potential non-invasive AD treatment that may serve as an adjunct therapy with FDA approved medications. METHODS: We conducted a 10-subject open label, single site study evaluating the effect of functional connectivity-resting state functional MRI guided-approach to TMS targeting with dysfunctional LSBNs in subjects with biomarker-confirmed early-stage AD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05292222). Subjects underwent pre-post imaging and testing to assess connectivity dysfunction and cognition. All participants received intermittent theta burst stimulation [(iTBS), (80% motor threshold; 5 sessions per day; 5\u202fdays; 3 targets; 18,000 pulses/day)] over 2\u202fweeks. Three Human Connectome Project (HCP) defined parcellations were targeted, with one common right temporal area G dorsal (RTGd) target across all subjects and two personalized. RESULTS: We identified the following parcellations to be dysfunctional: RTGd, left area 8A ventral (L8Av), left area 8B lateral (L8BL), and left area 55b (L55b). There were no changes in these parcellations after treatment, but subjects showed improvement on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status attention index (9.7; p\u202f=\u202f0.01). No subject dropped out of the treatment, though 3 participants were unable to tolerate the RTGd target due to facial twitching (n\u202f=\u202f2) and anxiety (n\u202f=\u202f1). CONCLUSION: Accelerated iTBS protocol was well-tolerated and personalized target-based treatment is feasible in early-stage AD. Further sham-controlled clinical trials are necessary to determine if this is an effective adjunctive treatment in early-stage AD.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) lead to neuronal loss; neurocognitive disorders (e.g., delirium, dementia) show cognitive decline. Early detection is crucial for effective management. Machine learning aids in more precise disease identification, potentially transforming healthcare. This comprehensive systematic review discusses how machine learning (ML), can enhance early detection of these disorders, surpassing traditional diagnostics' constraints. METHODS: In this review, databases were examined up to August 15th, 2023, for ML data on neurodegenerative and neurocognitive diseases using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Two investigators used the RAYYAN intelligence tool for systematic reviews to conduct the screening. Six blinded reviewers reviewed titles/abstracts. Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for quality assessment. RESULTS: Our search found 7,069 research studies, of which 1,365 items were duplicates and thus removed. Four thousand three hundred and thirty four studies were screened, and 108 articles met the criteria for inclusion after preprocessing. Twelve ML algorithms were observed for dementia, showing promise in early detection. Eighteen ML algorithms were identified for Parkinson's, each effective in detection and diagnosis. Studies emphasized that ML algorithms are necessary for Alzheimer's to be successful. Fourteen ML algorithms were discovered for mild cognitive impairment, with LASSO logistic regression being the only one with unpromising results. CONCLUSION: This review emphasizes the pressing necessity of integrating verified digital health resources into conventional medical practice. This integration may signify a new era in the early detection of neurodegenerative and neurocognitive illnesses, potentially changing the course of these conditions for millions globally. This study showcases specific and statistically significant findings to illustrate the progress in the area and the prospective influence of these advancements on the global management of neurocognitive and neurodegenerative illnesses.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Psychological telephone triage system for outpatient memory clinics - a way for adaptation to new challenges of increasing dementia prevalence and new treatment options?",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of dementia and new therapeutic developments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have created an urgent need for rapid and cost-effective methods to diagnose those affected in the early stages of the disease. Unlike emergency departments, memory clinics lack triage systems, e.g. the Manchester Triage System. METHOD: This retrospective, observational study evaluated the effects of a psychological telephone triage (PTT) system for people requesting an initial assessment at a specialized outpatient memory clinic over a 15-months period in terms of waiting times, staff resources, and as a screening method for cognitive disorders. The PTT consisted of an interdisciplinary pre-screening of available preliminary patient information prior to telephone contact, a semi-structured interview of approximately 30 min with a clinical psychologist, and telephone psychological counseling if there was no indication for an on-site dementia assessment. Based on the PTT interview, patients were triaged using a 4-level priority system (red = acute, yellow = subacute, green = not acute, blue = no indication/counseling). The results were compared with data from the two years prior to the introduction of PTT. RESULTS: The data of 612 people (327 before and 285 after the introduction of PTT) who called the secretary's office between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2024 and requested an initial assessment were analyzed. Of the original sample who called after the introduction of PTT, 66.7% had an indication for an on-site visit and were invited to do so. This was accepted by 51.6%. A further 14% received psychological telephone counseling, resulting in a 34% reduction in on-site visits. Patients triaged as acute cases had the shortest waiting time and presented with the most severe cognitive and functional symptoms at the on-site visit. DISCUSSION: Our study shows that PTT is an effective method to identify patients with urgent need for an initial dementia assessment and to provide psychological counseling as an alternative to on-site visits. We expect that this will reduce the number of emergency admissions and thus the burden on caregivers and the healthcare system. This PTT concept can thus help to better manage the increasing need for initial assessments in the context of new therapies for AD and the increasing prevalence of dementia in general.",

This study investigates A\u03b242:A\u03b240 oligomers in different ratios, examining their adverse effects on endothelial cells, neurons, astroglia, and microglia, as well as in a human blood-brain barrier (BBB) model. Combining label-free Raman microscopy with complementary imaging techniques and biochemical assays, we show the prominent impact of A\u03b240 on A\u03b242 fibrillation, suggesting an inhibitory effect on aggregation. Mixed oligomers, especially with low proportions of A\u03b242, were equally detrimental as pure A\u03b242 oligomers regarding cell viability, functionality, and metabolism. They also differentially affected lipid droplet metabolism in BBB-associated microglia, indicating distinct pathophysiological responses.

RESULTS: Acute exposure to 2 Gy X-rays induced the strongest response in the formation of \u03b3H2AX foci 30 min post irradiation, while \u03b1- and mixed beam-induced damage (\u03b1:X-ray\u202f=\u202f3:1) sustained longer. Fractionation of the same total dose (0.4 Gy daily) induced a similar number of \u03b3H2AX foci as after acute radiation, however, \u03b1- or mixed irradiation caused a higher expression of DNA damage response genes CDKN1A and MDM2 24 h after the last fraction, as well as a stronger decrease in cell viability and clonogenic survival compared to acute exposure. Phosphorylation of STING, followed by phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB subunit p65, was rapidly induced (1 or 3 h, respectively) after the last fraction by all radiation qualities. This led to IL-1\u03b2 secretion into the medium, strongly elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes and enhanced phagocytosis after fractionated exposure to \u03b1- and mixed beam-irradiation compared to their acute counterparts 24 h post-irradiation. Nevertheless, all inflammatory changes were returning to basal levels or below 10-14 days post irradiation. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, we demonstrate strong transient pro-inflammatory induction by daily high-LET radiation in a microglia model, triggering phagocytosis which may aid in clearing amyloid beta, but importantly, from a safety perspective, without long-term alterations.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Mutations in genes and precursors of \u03b2 amyloid (A\u03b2) are found in the familial form of the disease. This led to the evaluation of seven monoclonal antibodies against A\u03b2 in subjects with AD, two of which were approved for use by the FDA. They caused only a small improvement in cognitive function, probably because they were given to those with much more prevalent sporadic forms of dementia. They also have potentially serious adverse effects. Oxidative stress and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines are present in all subjects with AD and are well correlated with the degree of memory impairment. Drugs that affect these processes include TNF\u03b1 blocking antibodies and MAPK p38 inhibitors that reduce cognitive impairment when given for other inflammatory conditions. However, their adverse effects and inability to penetrate the brain preclude their use for dementia. Rosiglitazone is used to treat diabetes, a risk factor for AD, but failed in a clinical trial because it was given to subjects that already had dementia. Ladostigil reduces oxidative stress and suppresses the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from activated microglia without blocking their effects. Chronic oral administration to aging rats prevented the decline in memory and suppressed overexpression of genes adversely affecting synaptic function in relevant brain regions. In a phase 2 trial, ladostigil reduced the decline in short-term memory and in whole brain and hippocampal volumes in human subjects with mild cognitive impairment and had no more adverse effects than placebo.",

Natural compounds rich in polyphenols have garnered attention as a non-pharmacological means of treating and preventing AD. The primary component of wine, grape seeds, and nuts is polyphenols. Research suggests that polyphenols slow down the rate of neurodegeneration in AD and lessen learning impairment. Furthermore, polyphenols lessen brain impairments related to cognition. Additionally, polyphenols can specifically restructure amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) structures and soluble oligomers into non-toxic alternative species. They have also been revealed to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factors expression, suggesting that they have a positive impact on the creation of neurotrophins.

Currently, miglustat is the only approved drug for NPC1, thus the identification of new treatments is mandatory. We have previously demonstrated that the drug dipyridamole (DIP), an enhancer of adenosine signaling, can reduce the pathological phenotype in patient-derived fibroblasts. In this paper, we evaluated the in vivo effects of DIP in NPC1 mice. Male and female NPC1nih mice were treated with DIP 30\u2009mg/kg\u2009i.p. from 28 to 64\u2009days of age. Motor function was assessed by Erasmus Ladder test, hippocampal cognitive decline by Novel Object Recognition test and brain pathology by immunofluorescence and biochemical assays. Peripheral pathology was evaluated by analyzing lipid accumulation in spleen and liver (HP-TLC). In NPC1, mice DIP rescued recognition memory and increased hippocampal expression of calbindin. On the contrary, the drug was unable to improve motor function, cerebellar pathology and lipid accumulation in spleen and liver. Our results demonstrated that DIP selectively ameliorates the cognitive impairment in NPC1 mice.

Earlier strategies to treat AD such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) drugs are not showing effectiveness due to the inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, traditional AChEI provides limited efficacy in terms of bioavailability and solubility for treating AD treatment. Many of the current drugs such as donepezil taken to treat the disease exhibited harmful side effects. Hence, researchers are keen to find the alternative effective therapeutic agents for treating AD. This review summarizes the recent advancement in nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems of herbal drugs such as Curcumin, Ginkgo biloba, Salvia officinalis, etc for the prevention and cure of AD. Herbal drugs proved useful in treating neuronal disorders such as AD but exhibited some limitations like low bioavailability via oral drug delivery. Such limitations were overcome by tagging these drugs by nanoparticles which enables them to cross the blood-brain barrier and offer the delivery of greater concentration of herbal drugs to the brain. Inorganic nanoparticle-based drugdelivery systems such as gold nanoparticles and magnetic nanoparticles, organic nanoparticulate systems like polymeric micelles and dendrimers, and solid polymeric nanoparticles were some of the effective methods that have earlier shown potential for enhancing the delivery of herbal drugs to the brain. Long-term repeated injection of drugs loaded on nanomaterials can lead to the accumulation of nanomaterials in the body without timely and effective degradation which can cause serious issues to the brain. Hence, nanotechnology-based strategies should involve the formulation of nontoxic nanoparticles in such a way that they can significantly transport the drugs across the BBB followed by effective degradation of nanoparticles.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterised by gradual memory loss and neurodegeneration, is an important risk to global health. Despite the recent advances in the field of neuroscience, the complex biological mechanisms underlying the aetiology and pathology of AD have not been elucidated yet. The development of amyloid-beta plaques, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation have been identified as important components. The genesis of AD has been illuminated by advances in molecular techniques, which have shown the contributions of environmental, genetic, and epigenetic variables. Ongoing research is focused on the potential of bioactive compounds as therapeutic agents. Quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate, huperzine A, ginsenosides, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, zinc, bacosides from brahmi, and withanolide A from ashwagandha are among the compounds that have demonstrated encouraging effects in modifying disease pathways. These bioactive substances demonstrate their potential for symptomatic relief by providing neuroprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cognitive-enhancing properties. The present review presents the recent findings on AD pathogenesis, molecular mechanisms, and the impact of natural compounds, offering a comprehensive perspective on current and emerging strategies for managing this debilitating condition.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Apathy Associated with Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Apathy is a multidimensional and complex disease that is the primary neuropsychiatric symptom among those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, apathy in AD is sometimes underestimated. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search utilized specific keywords related to apathy and Alzheimer's disease (e.g., \"apathy,\" \"Alzheimer's disease,\" \"neuropsychiatric symptoms,\" \"front-striatal circuitry\"). The studies were selected based on pre-defined criteria, including publication date (within the last 10 years), peer-reviewed status, and relevance to neurobiological, neurochemical, and behavioral aspects of apathy in AD. The articles were screened through title and abstract reviews, followed by full-text evaluations to ensure they met the inclusion criteria, such as relevance to apathy in Alzheimer's patients, study design rigor, and methodological quality. RESULTS: Some research on the behavioral and neurobiological characteristics of apathy in AD points to the role of the front-striatal circuitry, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In addition, we reviewed the neurochemical, neuropsychological, and neuropathological characteristics believed to be associated with apathy symptoms. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that understanding the intricate neurobiological underpinnings of apathy in AD is crucial for developing targeted interventions. Our analysis suggests that a multimodal approach, incorporating both pharmacological and personalized non-pharmacological strategies, could enhance therapeutic efficacy and improve patient outcomes. This highlights the need for future research to explore these combined treatment modalities and their potential to alleviate apathy in AD patients.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The lack of effective therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease demands both the search for new drugs and the reconsideration of already known substances currently used in other areas of medicine. Drosophila melanogaster offers the potential to model features of Alzheimer's disease, study disease mechanisms, and conduct drug screening. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to analyze the neuroprotective properties of the drug \"carnicetine\", which is an acetylated form of the natural low molecular weight compound L-carnitine. The drug is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and is currently used as a means of improving cellular metabolism. METHODS: Using tissue-specific drivers, direct expression of amyloid beta peptide (42 amino acids) was exhibited in certain groups of neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster brain, namely in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. The effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (carnicetine) on the death of these neurons and the memory of flies was analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of amyloid beta peptide in dopaminergic or cholinergic neurons resulted in neurodegeneration of cholinergic neurons in the Drosophila brain and memory impairment. The use of carnicetine added to animal food made it possible to treat these disorders. At the same time, no effect on dopaminergic neurons was noted. CONCLUSION: The data obtained confirmed the neuroprotective properties of the drug under study, demonstrating its participation in the restoration of the cholinergic system and the feasibility of using carnicetine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Sense of coherence (SOC) is a disposition to perceive things as comprehensible, manageable and meaningful. Lower SOC is associated with subjective burden and psychological morbidity in family caregivers, including in dementia. However, the evidence-base mainly comprises small-scale or cross-sectional studies. More should be known about SOC stability, causal relationships, and international contexts. We aimed to study longitudinal links between dementia caregivers' SOC, subjective burden, and anxiety and depression symptoms in a multinational sample. METHODS: We analyzed the EU-Actifcare cohort (451 dyads of community-dwelling people with mild-moderate dementia and their caregivers). Caregivers' assessments included: SOC scale, Relatives' Stress Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A cross-lagged panel model was used to investigate associations between these measures at baseline, 6 and 12-month follow-ups, controlling for covariates. RESULTS: Caregivers' subjective burden, anxiety and depression symptoms increased over time, SOC remaining overall stable. Considering the first six-month follow-up, we found bidirectional relationships between SOC and subjective burden, and SOC and anxiety symptoms, while lower SOC predicted depression symptoms but not vice versa. For the remaining follow-up period, both anxiety and depression symptoms predicted lower SOC but not vice versa. LIMITATIONS: Convenience sampling precludes full generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: This large longitudinal study shed more light on interplays between SOC, subjective burden and mental health outcomes in dementia caregivers. Findings were consistent with SOC potential protective role against burden and psychological morbidity. However, they also supported reverse causality regarding part of the associations. Caregivers' SOC levels may be directly influenced by subjective burden and psychological morbidity.",

In recent years, there have been hints linking endosomal transport abnormalities to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, the related mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we provide an overview of endosomal-centered transport pathways and highlight potential physiological processes regulated by these pathways, with a particular focus on the correlation of endosomal trafficking disorders with common pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and glial response, complementing Alzheimer's disease (AD) core biomarkers, have improved the pathophysiological characterization of the disease. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the co-expression of multiple CSF biomarkers will help the identification of AD-like phenotypes when biomarker positivity thresholds are not met yet. METHODS: Two hundred and seventy cognitively unimpaired adults with family history (FH) of sporadic AD (mean age\u2009=\u200960.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.85 years, 64.8% women) underwent lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging (n\u2009=\u2009266) and positron emission tomography imaging (n\u2009=\u2009239) protocols, and clinical evaluations. CSF A\u03b242, A\u03b240, p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, NfL, neurogranin, sTREM2, YKL40, GFAP, S100, \u03b1-Synuclein, SYT1, and SNAP25 were measured. Participants were clustered based on CSF biomarker co-expression with an agglomerative algorithm. The predictive value of the classification against brain and cognitive outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS: Three clusters (C) were identified. Higher A\u03b2 burden and CSF p-tau was the hallmark of C1. The other two clusters showed lower A\u03b2 burden but higher expression of glial (C2) or synaptic markers (C3). Participants in C1 showed an AD-like clinical phenotype, comprising participants with the overall highest percentage of two parent FH and\u00a0APOE-\u03b54 carriers, in addition to comprising more females compared to C2. C3 displayed better vascular health compared to C1. C2 were older and comprised a lower percentage of females compared to C3. C1 showed an AD-like gray matter reduction in medial temporal (notably hippocampus) and frontal regions that were not observed in A\u03b242/40\u2009+\u2009compared with A\u03b242/40\u2009-\u2009. Furthermore, A\u03b242/40\u2009-\u2009participants in C1 showed GM reduction in inferior temporal areas compared with A\u03b242/40\u2009+\u2009participants overall. C1 membership also predicted cognitive decline in executive function, but not memory, beyond A\u03b2\u2009+\u2009status, overall suggesting a better prognosis in A\u03b242/40\u2009+\u2009participants without C1 membership. Additionally, C1 displayed a higher rate of conversion to A\u03b2\u2009+\u2009(25%) over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that examining multiple CSF biomarkers reflecting diverse pathological pathways may complement and/or outperform AD core biomarkers and thresholding approaches to identify individuals showing a clinical and cognitive AD-like phenotype, including higher conversion to A\u03b2\u2009+\u2009, GM reductions and cognitive decline. The clinical utility of this approach warrants further investigation and replication in other cohorts.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between anti-diabetic agents and the risks of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: Literature retrieval was conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Clinicaltrial.gov between January 1995 and October 2024. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with T2D, which intercompared anti-diabetic agents or compared them with placebo, and reported the incidence of dementia were included. Conventional and network meta-analyses of these studies were implemented. Results were exhibited as the odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 41 observational studies (3,307,483 participants) and 23 RCTs (155,443 participants) were included. In the network meta-analysis of observational studies, compared with non-users, sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) (OR\u2009=\u20090.56, 95%CI, 0.45 to 0.69), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) (OR\u2009=\u20090.58, 95%CI, 0.46 to 0.73), thiazolidinedione (TZD) (OR\u2009=\u20090.68, 95%CI, 0.57 to 0.81) and metformin (OR\u2009=\u20090.89, 95%CI, 0.80 to 0.99) treatments were all associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with T2D.

        "ArticleTitle": "Retinal thickness predicts the risk of cognitive decline over five years.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Dementia poses a significant burden on healthcare systems. Early identification of individuals at risk for cognitive decline is crucial. The retina, an extension of the central nervous system, reflects neurodegenerative changes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive tool for assessing retinal health and has shown promise in predicting cognitive decline. However, prior studies produced mixed results. METHODS: This study investigated a large cohort (n\u2009=\u2009490) of Asian individuals attending memory clinics. Participants underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing annually for five years. Retinal thickness was measured by OCT at baseline. We assessed the association between baseline retinal thickness and subsequent cognitive decline. RESULTS: Participants with a significantly thinner macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) at baseline (\u2264\u200979\u00a0\u03bcm) had a 38% greater risk of cognitive decline compared to those who did not (\u2265\u200988\u00a0\u03bcm; p\u2009=\u20090.037). In a multivariable model accounting for age, education, cerebrovascular disease status, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and smoking, thinner GCIPL was associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.14, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01-1.30, p\u2009=\u20090.035). Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was not associated with cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that OCT-derived macular GCIPL thickness may be a valuable biomarker for identifying individuals at risk of cognitive decline. Our findings highlight GCIPL as a potentially more sensitive marker compared to RNFL thickness for detecting early neurodegenerative changes.

        "AbstractText": "A high-fat diet (HFD) induces obesity and insulin resistance, which may exacerbate amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) pathology during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) accumulate in obese or insulin-resistant patients and animal models. However, roles of accumulated BCAAs and their metabolites, branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs), in the HFD-induced deterioration of AD and the underlying mechanisms remains largely unclear. In this study, APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were fed a HFD for 6\u00a0months, and the BCAAs content of the HFD was adjusted to 200% or 50% to determine the effects of BCAAs. The HFD-fed APP/PS1 mice accumulated BCAAs and BCKAs in the serum and cortex, which was accompanied by more severe cognitive deficits and AD-related pathology. The additional or restricted intake of BCAAs aggravated or reversed these phenomena. Importantly, BCAAs and BCKAs repressed microglial phagocytosis of A\u03b2 in vivo and in BV2 cells, which might be relevant for triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) dysfunction and autophagy deficiency. We found that BCAAs and BCKAs could bind to TREM2 in silico, in pure protein solutions and in the cellular environment. These molecules competed with A\u03b2 for binding to TREM2 so that the response of TREM2 to A\u03b2 was impaired. Moreover, BCAAs and BCKAs decreased TREM2 recycling in an mTOR-independent manner, which might also lead to TREM2 dysfunction. Our findings suggest that accumulated BCAAs and BCKAs contribute to the HFD-induced acceleration of AD progression through hypofunctional TREM2-mediated disturbances in A\u03b2 clearance in microglia. Lowering BCAAs and BCKAs levels may become a potential dietary intervention for AD.",

This study aimed to explore the molecular intersections between TBI and AD, focusing on the role of adipose mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC)-derived exosomes and hub genes involved in microglial polarization. Transcriptome profiles from TBI (GSE58485) and AD (GSE74614) datasets were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The hub genes were validated in independent datasets (GSE180811 for TBI and GSE135999 for AD) and localized to specific cell types using single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing data (GSE160763 for TBI and GSE224398 for AD). Experimental validation was conducted to investigate the role of these genes in microglial polarization using cell culture and ADMSC-derived exosomes interventions. Our results identified three hub genes-Bst2, B2m, and Lgals3bp-that were upregulated in both TBI and AD, with strong associations to inflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and tissue repair processes. scRNA sequencing revealed that these genes are predominantly expressed in microglia, with increased expression during M1 polarization. Knockdown of these genes reduced M1 polarization and promoted M2 phenotype in microglia. Additionally, ADMSC-derived exosomes attenuated M1 polarization and downregulated the expression of hub genes. This study provides novel insights into the shared molecular pathways between TBI and AD, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for mitigating neuroinflammation and promoting recovery in both conditions.",

        "AbstractText": "Essential for brain formation and protective against tauopathy, activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is critical for neurogenesis and cognitive functions, while regulating steroid hormone biogenesis. As such, de novo mutations in ADNP lead to syndromic autism and somatic ADNP mutations parallel Alzheimer's disease progression. Furthermore, clinical trials with the ADNP fragment NAP (the investigational drug davunetide) showed efficacy in women suffering from the tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy and differentially boosted memory in men (spatial) and women (verbal), exhibiting prodromal Alzheimer's disease. While autism is more prevalent in boys and Alzheimer's disease in women, both involve impaired neurogenesis. Here, we asked whether ADNP sex-dependently regulates neurogenesis. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a marker of neurogenesis, we identified two-fold higher labeling in the hippocampal sub-ventricular zone of ADNP-intact male versus female mice. Adnp haplo-insufficient (Adnp+/-) mice or mice CRSIPR/Cas9-edited to present the most prevalent neurodevelopmental ADNP syndrome mutation, p.Tyr718* (Tyr) showed dramatic reductions in male BrdU incorporation, resulting in mutated females presenting higher labeling than males. Treatment with NAP compensated for the male reduction of BrdU labeling. Mechanistically, hippocampal RNAseq revealed male-specific Tyr down-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response genes critical for sex-dependent organogenesis. Newly discovered mitochondrial accessibility of ADNP was inhibited by the Tyr718* mutation further revealing female-specific Tyr downregulation of mitochondrial ATP6. NAP moderated much of the differential expression caused by p.Tyr718*, accompanied by the down-regulation of neurotoxic, pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes. Thus, ADNP is a key regulator of sex-dependent neurogenesis that acts by controlling canonical pathways, with NAP compensating for fundamental ADNP deficiencies, striding toward clinical development targeting the ADNP syndrome and related neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative diseases.",

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals with early-onset (age <65 years at onset) and/or atypical dementia (features other than memory at onset), who were evaluated at a tertiary care memory clinic. All participants underwent measurements of CSF biomarkers (A\u03b242, p-tau181, and total tau levels), as well as [18F]FDG-PET scans, amyloid-PET scans, and plasma p-tau217 quantifications. To determine whether the [18F]FDG-PET images were compatible with AD, images were visually rated by 2 nuclear medicine experts. Using a contingency analysis, we evaluated the accuracy of [18F]FDG-PET scan interpretation and plasma p-tau217 for an AD biomarker profile in CSF and for amyloid-PET positivity. RESULTS: A total of 81 individuals with early onset and/or atypical dementia were included in this study (mean age = 65 years; 48/81 female (59%). Both [18F]FDG-PET and plasma p-tau217 showed high levels of agreement with reference standard AD biomarkers ([18F]FDG-PET area under the curve [AUC]: 71%; plasma p-tau217 AUC: 81%). Although both biomarkers had similar specificity for AD [18F]FDG-PET: 70%, CI: 0.56-0.81; plasma p-tau217: 70%, CI: 0.56-0.81), plasma p-tau217 had higher sensitivity for AD (plasma p-tau217: 97%, CI: 0.85-0.99 vs [18F]FDG-PET: 73%, CI: 0.57-0.85) (p = 0.01).

Recent studies on AD stage classification are increasingly using multimodal data. However, few studies have applied graph neural networks to multimodal data comprising F-18 florbetaben (FBB) amyloid brain positron emission tomography (PET) images and clinical indicators. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of graph convolutional network (GCN) for AD stage classification using multimodal data, specifically FBB PET images and clinical indicators, collected from Dong-A University Hospital (DAUH) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The effectiveness of GCN was demonstrated through comparisons with the support vector machine, random forest, and multilayer perceptron across four classification tasks (normal control (NC) vs. AD, NC vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI), MCI vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI vs. AD). As input, all models received the same combined feature vectors, created by concatenating the PET imaging feature vectors extracted by the 3D dense convolutional network and non-imaging feature vectors consisting of clinical indicators using multimodal feature fusion method. An adjacency matrix for the population graph was constructed using cosine similarity or the Euclidean distance between subjects' PET imaging feature vectors and/or non-imaging feature vectors. The usage ratio of these different modal data and edge assignment threshold were tuned by setting them as hyperparameters. In this study, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com were the GCN models that received the adjacency matrix constructed using cosine similarity (CS) and the Euclidean distance (ED) between the subjects' PET imaging feature vectors and non-imaging feature vectors, respectively. In modified nested cross validation, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com respectively achieved average test accuracies of 98.40%, 94.58%, 94.01%, 82.63% and 99.68%, 93.82%, 93.88%, 90.43% for the four aforementioned classification tasks using DAUH dataset, outperforming the other models. Furthermore, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com respectively achieved average test accuracies of 76.16% and 90.11% for NC vs. MCI vs. AD classification using ADNI dataset, outperforming the other models.

In this study, we established a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease via intracerebroventricular injection of fibrillar amyloid-\u03b2 to investigate the effect of D30 on fibrillar amyloid-\u03b2-induced neuropathology. Our results showed that D30 alleviated fibrillar amyloid-\u03b2-induced cognitive impairment, promoted fibrillar amyloid-\u03b2 clearance from the hippocampus and cortex, suppressed oxidative stress, and inhibited activation of microglia and astrocytes. D30 also reversed the fibrillar amyloid-\u03b2-induced loss of dendritic spines and synaptic protein expression. Notably, we demonstrated that exogenous fibrillar amyloid-\u03b2 introduced by intracerebroventricular injection greatly increased galectin-3 expression levels in the brain, and this increase was blocked by D30. Considering the role of D30 in clearing amyloid-\u03b2, inhibiting neuroinflammation, protecting synapses, and improving cognition, this study highlights the potential of galectin-3 as a promising treatment target for patients with Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is emerging as a promising therapeutic agent for neuropathic and other pain-related conditions. This naturally occurring fatty acid has drawn interest because of its ability to regulate pain and inflammation. Initially identified in food sources, PEA has been the subject of extensive research to elucidate its properties, efficacy, and clinical applications. PEA primarily exerts its effects through interaction with its primary receptor PPAR \u03b1, this interaction influences pain signalling pathways and neuroinflammatory processes by modulating the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mast cell degranulation, microglial activation, and decrease of oxidative stress. PEA's interaction with endocannabinoid receptors decreases the inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and thereby a descending pain sensation. The pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characteristics of PEA are examined in this paper, along with its potential for efficiency when used in in combination additional therapies in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's. Experimental evidence shows that PEA not only reduces pain and inflammation but also lowers the need for higher dosages of other drugs hence minimizing the risk of drug toxicity. The bioavailability of PEA has been enhanced by recent technological developments, which emphasize continuous research efforts to maximize PEA's therapeutic potential in pain treatment and associated medical sectors.",

RasGEF Domain Family Member 1C (RASGEF1C) could regulated Alzheimer's disease. However, its function in various cancers, including LUAD, is poorly understood. In the present study, we discovered that high expression of RASGEF1C in LUAD was associated with poorer prognosis, unfavorable histological features, and poorer pathological staging. In addition, RASGEF1C expression was an independent predictor of overall survival, disease specific survival, and progress free interval in patients with LUAD. High expression of RASGEF1C was linked to signaling pathways that are involved in the immune response and cell proliferation, according to KEGG enrichment analysis. Additionally, we verified that RASGEF1C was highly expressed in LUAD cell lines and that RASGEF1C knockdown dramatically decreased the capacity of LUAD cell lines to invade, migrate, and proliferate. Our research provides mechanistic insights into the function of RASGEF1C in the progression of LUAD and suggests that RASGEF1C is a prospective target for future therapy.",

However, the association of immune-mediated diseases with the risk of incident dementia has not been well characterised. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the prospective association of 27 immune-mediated diseases and incident dementia risk and to explore the underlying mechanisms driven by brain structures. METHODS: We included 487\u00a0459 UK Biobank participants aged 37-73 years without dementia at enrolment. Immune-mediated diseases and dementia cases were ascertained according to the International Classification of Diseases codes. Time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression and general linear regression models were used to examine the association of immune-mediated disease with incident dementia risk and brain morphometric measures, respectively. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 1654 cases of incident dementia were documented in 86\u00a0243 patients with immune-mediated diseases. Overall, immune-mediated diseases were associated with a higher all-cause dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.32). Five out of 27 immune-mediated diseases were associated with an increased risk of dementia individually. Comorbidity of multiple immune-mediated diseases further increased the risk. Moreover, the immune-mediated disease was associated with smaller total surface areas of both left (\u03b2, -286.51; SE, 102.58; P = .014) and right hemispheres (\u03b2, -298.56; SE, 103.96; P = .016), greater white matter hyperintensities volume (\u03b2, 1.02; SE, 0.13; P < .001) and less healthy white matter microstructures.

A cortical signature of EOAD was recently proposed and may facilitate EOAD investigation. Here, we aimed to validate this proposed MRI biomarker of EOAD neurodegeneration in an Appalachian clinical cohort. We also compared differences in EOAD signature atrophy in participants with biomarker-positive EOAD, LOAD, early-onset non-AD pathologies, and cognitively normal individuals. Cortical thinning was reliably detected in eight of nine signature areas of persons with EOAD relative to cognitively normal individuals despite very early disease stage. Additionally, individuals with EOAD showed thinner cortex in most signature regions relative to those with early-onset non-AD pathologies. EOAD and LOAD showed similar cortical atrophy within most EOAD signature regions. Whole-brain vertex-wise cortical analyses supported these findings. Furthermore, signature cortical atrophy showed expected relationships with measures of global and specific cognitive and functional status. This investigation further validates and expands upon the recently defined EOAD signature and suggests its robustness within a rural population, even at early disease stage. Larger scale and longitudinal studies employing this marker of EOAD neurodegeneration are needed to further understand clinical effects and appropriate management of persons with EOAD.",

        "AbstractText": "Oxidative stress is an important driver of aging and has been linked to numerous neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. A key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's are filamentous inclusions made of the microtubule associated protein Tau. Based on alternative splicing, Tau protein can feature either three or four microtubule binding repeats. Distinctively, three-repeat Tau contains a single cysteine; four-repeat Tau contains two. Although there is evidence that the cysteines in pathological Tau filaments exist in the reduced form, very little is known about the alternative disulfide-bonded state. It is unclear whether it can exist nontransiently in the reducing environment of the cytosol. Such knowledge, however, is important as different redox states of Tau could modulate aggregation. To address this question, we transfected HEK293 cells expressing the P301S variant of four-repeat Tau with fibril seeds composed of compact, disulfide-bonded Tau monomers. In vitro, these fibrils are observed to recruit only compact Tau, but not Tau in which the cysteines are reduced or replaced by alanines or serines. In line with this characteristic, the fibrils dissociate when treated with a reducing agent. When offered to HEK293 cells, variant Tau protein is recruited to the seeds forming intracellular fibrils with the same seeding properties as the in vitro counterparts. Markedly, the proteins in these fibrils have a compact, disulfide-bonded configuration and dissociate upon reduction. These findings reveal that uptake of exogeneous fibril seeds triggers oxidation of Tau monomers, modulating intracellular aggregation.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (ALZ) is a neurodegenerative disease that damages neuronal cells and causes decline in cognitive abilities. Administration of cholinesterase inhibitor compounds is the primary choice in the treatment of ALZ, one of which is rivastigmine (RVT). Several routes of administration of RVT are available, such as oral and transdermal. However, in the oral route, RVT has low bioavailability, undergoes first-pass metabolism, and the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) reduces the therapeutic concentration of RVT. The transdermal route is nonselective target in the brain. This study aims to combine thermosensitive mucoadhesive gel (TG) and lipid microspheres (LM) as a drug delivery system to improve the efficacy of RVT. Combining these will prevent systemic side effects of RVT and increase drug concentration in the brain. LM was formulated with varying concentrations of Compritol polymer. The results of LM evaluation showed the values of particle size, PDI, and %EE and %DL were 8.519 \u03bcm, 0.018 \u00b1 0.004, 72.54%, and 76.43%, respectively. The TG formulation can provide a liquid form at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) and a gel at nasal temperature (35 \u00b0C). Hemolytic and HET-CAM tests confirmed TG RVT LM's safety for use. Ex vivo studies showed controlled and sustained release of TG RVT LM, and in vivo studies showed TG RVT LM a higher pharmacokinetic profile in the brain than oral formulations and injections. The Cmax was found to be 7.05 \u00b1 0.55 \u03bcg/cm3, Tmax was 24 h, and AUC0-24, which is related to the effectiveness of brain targeting, was 225.73 \u03bcg/cm3. In conclusion, this study shows the successful development of TG RVT LM, as evidenced by improved drug delivery to the brain, which is characterized by higher concentrations of RVT in the brain compared with oral and injectable RVT, this delivery system shows potential as a future treatment for Alzheimer's disease.",

There are currently no specific causes or conditions for this disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess AD prevalence across different stages using machine learning (ML) approaches comprehensively. METHODS: The selection of papers was conducted in 3 phases, as per PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) 2020 guidelines: identification, screening, and final inclusion. The final analysis included 24 papers that met the criteria. The selection of ML approaches for AD diagnosis was rigorously based on their relevance to the investigation. The prevalence of patients with AD at 2, 3, 4, and 6 stages was illustrated through the use of forest plots. RESULTS: The prevalence rate for both cognitively normal (CN) and AD across 6 studies was 49.28% (95% CI 46.12%-52.45%; P=.32). The prevalence estimate for the 3 stages of cognitive impairment (CN, mild cognitive impairment, and AD) is 29.75% (95% CI 25.11%-34.84%, P<.001). Among 5 studies with 14,839 participants, the analysis of 4 stages (nondemented, moderately demented, mildly demented, and AD) found an overall prevalence of 13.13% (95% CI 3.75%-36.66%; P<.001). In addition, 4 studies involving 3819 participants estimated the prevalence of 6 stages (CN, significant memory concern, early mild cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and AD), yielding a prevalence of 23.75% (95% CI 12.22%-41.12%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The significant heterogeneity observed across studies reveals that demographic and setting characteristics are responsible for the impact on AD prevalence estimates. This study shows how ML approaches can be used to describe AD prevalence across different stages, which provides valuable insights for future research.",

METHODS: A total of 26,554 residents aged 50 years and older were recruited. Multinomial logistic regression models were applied to assess the risk factors of cognition levels. Propensity score matching and linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate the relationship between key risk factors and the circulating biomarkers. RESULTS: Shared and distinct risk factors for MCI and dementia were identified. Age, lower education, medical history of stroke, hypertension, and epilepsy influenced mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression to dementia. Correlations between key risk factors and circulating neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2)40, and A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio suggest underlying mechanisms contributing to cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION: The common and distinct risk factors across cognitive decline stages emphasize the need for tailored interventions. The correlations with blood biomarkers provide insights into potential management targets. HIGHLIGHTS: From a large community-based cohort study on the residents in Chongqing, we have identified that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia share several common risk factors, including age, female gender, rural living, lower education levels, and a medical history of stroke. However, each condition also has its own unique risk factors. Several factors contribute to the progression of MCI into dementia including age, education levels, occupation, and a medical history of hypertension and epilepsy. We discover the correlations between the risk factors for dementia and blood biomarkers that indicate the presence of axonal damage, glial activation, and A\u03b2 pathology.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) manifests prior to the age of 65, and affects 4%-8% of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current analyses sought to examine longitudinal cognitive trajectories of participants with early-onset dementia. METHODS: Data from 307 cognitively normal (CN) volunteer participants and those with amyloid-positive EOAD or amyloid-negative cognitive impairment (EOnonAD) were compared. Cognitive trajectories across a comprehensive cognitive battery spanning 42 months were examined using mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS: The EOAD group displayed worse cognition at baseline relative to EOnonAD and CN groups, and more aggressive declines in cognition over time. The largest effects were observed on measures of executive functioning domains, while memory declines were blunted in EOAD. DISCUSSION: EOAD declined 2-4\u00d7 faster than EOnonAD, and EOAD pathology is not restricted to memory networks. Early identification of deficits is critical to ensure that individuals with sporadic EOAD can be considered for treatment using disease-modifying medications. HIGHLIGHTS: Represents the most comprehensive longitudinal characterization of sporadic EOAD to date. The trajectory of cognitive declines was steep for EOAD participants and worse than for other groups. Executive functioning measures exhibited the greatest declines over time in EOAD.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether the cerebellum develops neuropathology that correlates with well-accepted Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathological markers and cognitive status. METHODS: We studied cerebellar cytoarchitecture in a cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a030) of brain donors. In a larger cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a0605), we queried whether the weight of the contents of the posterior fossa (PF), which contains primarily cerebellum, correlated with dementia status. RESULTS: Although there was no granular layer (GL) cell loss, GL area was lower in AD cases, particularly in the lateral cerebellum. Lower numbers of mossy fiber synaptic terminals in the cerebellar GL of AD cases correlated with Braak stages IV-VI. PF content weight correlated with dementia independently of age, neuropathology, and education. In addition, we found that a measure of the relative size of the PF content weight to total brain weight correlated with less dementia. DISCUSSION: These results confirm that the cerebellum is not spared neuropathological damage in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Novel evidence of cerebellar atrophy in the granule cell layer of the lateral cerebellar cortex (or 'cognitive cerebellum'), and loss of a specific cerebellar synapse type in this region, the cerebellar glomerulus. Both correlated with dementia status and Braak stages IV through VI, in a cohort with complete neuropathological characterization. Although there have been recent brain imaging studies suggesting a role for cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease, we believe our study constitutes some of the most concrete neuropathological evidence to date of anatomic and synaptic substrates that are disrupted in AD. These changes in this cerebellar region may even play a role in the etiology of cognitive symptoms. Novel evidence that individuals with lower postmortem cerebellar weights showed more cognitive decline, independent of classical neuropathology markers such as Braak stage, Thal phase, or Corsortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) score, suggesting a role for this brain region in dementia, using advanced statistical analysis of a large unbiased population cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0605), the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. Conversely, a measure of how intact the cerebellum was correlated with less dementia, independent of classical neuropathology markers and cerebral cortical weight, again, in the ACT cohort of 605 brain donors. We believe that this novel finding has relevance and implications for the identification of resilience factors, which may protect against the development of dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies are characterized by intracellular aggregates of microtubule-associated protein tau that are actively released and promote proteopathic spread. Microglia engulf pathological proteins, but how they endocytose tau is unknown. METHODS: We measured endocytosis of different tau species by microglia after pharmacological modulation of macropinocytosis or clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) or antagonism/genetic depletion of known tau receptors heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). RESULTS: Dynamin inhibition decreased microglial endocytosis of all tested tau species. Meanwhile, HSPG antagonism blocked only fibril uptake, and LRP1 antagonism or genetic depletion inconsistently inhibited the endocytosis of fibrils and monomers. Cre recombinase robustly enhanced tau uptake with partial selectivity for fibrils. DISCUSSION: These data show that microglia take up both tau monomers and aggregates via a dynamin-dependent form of endocytosis (eg, CME) but may differ in using HSPGs for entry depending on species. HIGHLIGHTS: Microglial endocytosis of tau monomers and fibrils is dynamin-dependent. HSPG antagonism blocks microglial uptake of tau fibrils but not monomers.

MAMs vary in thickness and length, impacting their functions. Here, we examined the effect of MAM thickness on A\u03b2 in our 3D neural model of AD. METHODS: We employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or fluorescence-based MAM stabilizers, electron microscopy, A\u03b2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and live-cell imaging with kymography to assess how stabilizing MAMs of different gap widths influence A\u03b2 production and MAM axonal mobility. RESULTS: Stabilizing tight MAMs (\u223c6\u00a0nm gap width) significantly increased A\u03b2 levels, whereas basal (\u223c25\u00a0nm) and loose MAMs (\u223c40\u00a0nm) maintained or reduced A\u03b2 levels, respectively. Tight MAMs reduced mitochondrial axonal velocity compared to basal MAMs, while loose MAMs showed severely reduced axonal distribution. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that stabilizing MAMs of specific gap widths, particularly in axons, without complete destabilization could be an effective therapeutic strategy for AD. HIGHLIGHTS: The stabilization of MAMs exacerbates or ameliorates A\u03b2 generation from AD neurons in a MAM gap width-dependent manner. A specific stabilization threshold within the MAM gap width spectrum shifts the amyloidogenic process to non-amyloidogenic. Tight MAMs slow down mitochondrial axonal transport compared to lose MAMs offering a quantitative method for measuring MAM stabilization.",

Herein, this work designs a mitochondria-targeted micelle CsA-TK-SS-31 (CTS) to block the progression of AD by simultaneously alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia and neurons. The mitochondria-targeted peptide SS-31 drives cyclosporin A (CsA) to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and delivers CsA to mitochondria of microglia and neurons in the brains of 5 \u00d7 FAD mice. Under the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) environment in damaged mitochondria of microglia and neurons, the linker (thioketal, TK) between CsA and SS-31 is broken and CsA and SS-31 are released while consuming ROS in the microenvironment. The released CsA and SS-31 synergistically restore the mitochondrial membrane potential and the balance between the fission and fusion of mitochondria, which subsequently protect neurons from apoptosis and reduce the activation of microglia in the brains of 5 \u00d7 FAD mice. Ultimately, the neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment of 5 \u00d7 FAD mice are ameliorated. This research provides a synergistic treatment strategy for AD through alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction to reduce neuroinflammation and restore the function of neurons simultaneously.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Adjustable lifestyle factors, such as diet, are associated with cognitive functions, structural and functional brain measures, but the association between the functional connectivity (FC) and the Mediterranean Diet (Medicine) in population without dementia is yet to be explored. METHODS: The association between MeDi and brain FC in 105 individuals without dementia aged 63 (SD \u00b1 8.72) years old who underwent brain MRI including resting-state (rs) functional MRI (fMRI) was examined. Dietary intake was evaluated through four 24-h recalls using the multiple-pass method and adherence to the MeDi was estimated using the MedDietScore, with higher values indicating greater adherence to MeDi. Multivariable linear regression models were used to investigate the associations between FC (both positive and negative associations) and MedDietScore. RESULTS: Rs-fMRI analysis revealed significant associations between FC and MedDietScore. The FC between the medial prefrontal cortex and a cluster located in left postcentral gyrus and in the left supramarginal gyrus was positively associated with MedDietScore. On the other hand, the FC between medial visual and right posterior division of both middle and superior temporal gyrus was negatively associated with MedDietScore. Of note, a temporal negative correlation was detected between above-mentioned FC networks. The FC between superior temporal gyrus and occipital regions was associated with participants' attention, executive functions, and memory scores. Furthermore, the associations for attention and executive functions were pronounced in participants with high adherence to MeDi compared to those with low adherence to MeDi. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our study documented an association between higher adherence to MeDi and rs-FC in fronto-parietal and temporo-occipital regions, particularly in areas that are involved in cognitive processes altered across normal and pathological aging. From a clinical point of view, our findings support a favorable role of MeDi on FC which may have significant clinical implications in the rapidly aging population. Rs-fMRI is also proposed as a useful tool in the emerging field of nutritional neuroscience and a candidate non-invasive biomarker of brain aging.",

Herein we report the discovery of 3-thio-1,2,4-triazole series as selective and high affinity SST4 agonists. Thirty-three compounds show <100 nM binding affinity, five of which had sub-nanomolar binding affinity and >300-fold selectivity over other SST subtypes. SST4 cAMP inhibition assay activity data aligned with the ligand binding affinity. Comparative docking results of the ligands under investigation with the cryo-EM and most recent model-built SST4 structures suggest similar trends in binding. Amino acids responsible for high and moderate affinity were identified, whereas poorer ligand conformations and limited interactions were observed with the low-affinity compounds.

        "AbstractText": "Tau pathology in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) follows a distinct pattern, beginning in the entorhinal cortex (ERC) and spreading to interconnected brain regions. Early-stage tau pathology, characterized by soluble phosphorylated tau, is difficult to study in human brains post-mortem due to rapid dephosphorylation. Rhesus macaques, which naturally develop age-related tau pathology resembling human AD, provide an ideal model for investigating early tau etiology. This study examines the molecular processes underlying tau pathology in the macaque ERC, focusing on calcium and inflammatory signaling pathways. Our findings reveal age-related decreases in PDE4 phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze cAMP and increases in calpain-2 and GCPII that occur in parallel with early-stage tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple epitopes (pS214-tau, pT181-tau, pT217-tau). These findings suggest that dysregulated calcium signaling in ERC, beginning in middle-age, primes tau for hyperphosphorylation, potentially driving the early stages of AD, advancing our understanding of how ERC vulnerabilities contribute to neurodegeneration in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite multiple studies reporting this connection, the mechanism by which T2D exacerbates AD is poorly understood. It is challenging to design studies that address co-occurring and comorbid diseases, limiting the number of existing evidence bases. To address this challenge, we expanded the applications of a computational framework called Translatable Components Regression (TransComp-R), initially designed for cross-species translation modeling, to perform cross-disease modeling to identify biological programs of T2D that may exacerbate AD pathology. Using TransComp-R, we combined peripheral blood-derived T2D and AD human transcriptomic data to identify T2D principal components predictive of AD status. Our model revealed genes enriched for biological pathways associated with inflammation, metabolism, and signaling pathways from T2D principal components predictive of AD. The same T2D PC predictive of AD outcomes unveiled sex-based differences across the AD datasets. We performed a gene expression correlational analysis to identify therapeutic hypotheses tailored to the T2D-AD axis. We identified six T2D and two dementia medications that induced gene expression profiles associated with a non-T2D or non-AD state. Finally, we assessed our blood-based T2DxAD biomarker signature in post-mortem human AD and control brain gene expression data from the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. Using partial least squares discriminant analysis, we identified a subset of genes from our cross-disease blood-based biomarker panel that significantly separated AD and control brain samples. Our methodological advance in cross-disease modeling identified biological programs in T2D that may predict the future onset of AD in this population. This, paired with our therapeutic gene expression correlational analysis, also revealed alogliptin, a T2D medication that may help prevent the onset of AD in T2D patients.",

It is influenced by many factors, including environmental exposures, genotype, cell type, sex, and aging. Since age is the primary risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases, it is important to determine if aging-related DNA methylation is retained when cells are reprogrammed to an induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) state. Here, we selected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; n = 99) from a cohort of diverse and healthy individuals enrolled in the Genetic and Epigenetic Signatures of Translational Aging Laboratory Testing (GESTALT) study to convert to iPSCs. After reprogramming we evaluated the resulting iPSCs for DNA methylation signatures to determine if they reflect the confounding factors of age and environmental factors. We used genome-wide DNA methylation arrays in both cell types to show that the epigenetic clock is largely reset to an early methylation age after conversion of PBMCs to iPSCs. We further examined the epigenetic age of each cell type using an Epigenome-wide Association Study (EWAS). Finally, we identified a set of methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (methQTL) in each cell type. Our results show that age-related DNA methylation is largely reset in iPSCs, and each cell type has a unique set of methylation sites that are genetically influenced.",

In an AD mouse model, this combination therapy significantly improved memory function and reduced AD-related pathologies compared to vehicle and single-drug treatments. Single-nuclei transcriptomic analysis confirmed that the therapy reversed disease-associated gene networks in a cell-type-specific manner.

One potential contributor to age-related memory decline is diminished neural selectivity -- i.e., a decline in the differential response of cortical regions to preferred vs. non-preferred stimuli during event perception -- yet the factors driving variability in neural selectivity with age remain unclear. We examined the impact of top-down attention and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology on neural selectivity during memory encoding in 156 cognitively unimpaired older participants who underwent fMRI while performing a word-face and word-scene associative memory task. Neural selectivity in face- and place-selective cortical regions was greater during events that were later remembered compared to forgotten. Critically, neural selectivity during learning positively scaled with memory-related variability in top-down attention, whereas selectivity negatively related to early AD pathology, evidenced by elevated plasma pTau181. Path analysis revealed that neural selectivity at encoding mediated the effects of age, top-down attention, and pTau181 on associative memory. Collectively, these data reveal multiple pathways that contribute to memory differences among older adults -- AD-independent reductions in top-down attention and AD-related pathology alter the precision of cortical representations of events during experience, with consequences for remembering.",

This study aimed to analyze the association between anemia and brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging data from brain health checkups. METHOD: Participants underwent brain health checkups between January 2015 and March 2022. Blood samples were collected to measure hemoglobin concentrations and mean corpuscular volumes. The modified Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate cognitive function. Magnetic resonance images were analyzed using voxel-based Morphometry to evaluate the overall patterns of brain volume. After extracting the principal components (PCs) from PC analysis, we investigated their association with MMSE scores and anemia. RESULTS: This study included 1,029 participants and identified principal components, representing smaller volume in the frontal lobe (PC1), and smaller volume in the limbic system to the temporal lobe (PC2). A higher PC2 score was significantly associated with a lower MMSE score. Male participants with anemia had smaller bilateral PC1 volumes and left hippocampal volumes, and female participants with anemia had smaller bilateral PC2 volumes and hippocampus volumes. DISCUSSION: PC2 may represent the extent of disease affecting limbic system volume, such as Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest that anemia may be associated with smaller volumes in the limbic system, especially in women.

Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether there are common aging genes across organs or tissues, and whether these aging genes play a pivotal role in the development of age-related diseases. METHODS: In this study, we screened for aging genes using RNAseq data of 32 human tissues from GTEx. RNAseq datasets from GEO were used to study whether aging genes drives age-related diseases, or whether anti-aging solutions could reverse aging gene expression. RESULTS: Aging transcriptome alterations showed that brain aging differ significantly from the rest of the body, furthermore, brain tissues were divided into four group according to their aging transcriptome alterations. Numerous genes were downregulated during brain aging, with functions enriched in synaptic function, ubiquitination, mitochondrial translation and autophagy. Transcriptome analysis of age-related diseases and retarding aging solutions showed that downregulated aging genes in the hippocampus further downregulation in Alzheimer's disease but were effectively reversed by high physical activity. Furthermore, the neuron loss observed during aging was reversed by high physical activity. CONCLUSION: The downregulation of many genes is a major contributor to brain aging and neurodegeneration. High levels of physical activity have been shown to effectively reactivate these genes, making it a promising strategy to slow brain aging.",

Enzymes that catalyse the complete breakdown of proteins are known as proteases. The peptide bonds in proteins are degraded by these serine proteases, which cause amyloid disaggregation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We have searched for related articles using the search engines Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus for the past 10 years, selected the relevant articles, and written the outcomes and benefits of protease using the medical topic \"serine protease\" and the following text phrases -keratinase, lumbrokinase, serratiopeptidase, nattokinase. KEY RESULTS: Alkaline serine proteases exhibit activity within the neutral to alkaline pH range. They are most capable of degrading host complement proteins, cytokines, and host clotting factors mostly due to their serine centre or metallotype. Because of its potential usage in food, pharmaceutical, and other industrial domains, this category of enzymes has been extensively investigated. Specifically, serine proteases are a group of enzymes that can be consumed orally and are stable in our gastrointestinal tract.

        "AbstractText": "Dementia probably due to Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that manifests in cognitive decline and impairs patients' daily life. Affected patients show great heterogeneity in their symptomatic progression, which hampers the identification of efficacious treatments in clinical trials. Using artificial intelligence approaches to enable clinical enrichment trials serves a promising avenue to identify treatments. In this work, we used a deep learning method to cluster the multivariate disease trajectories of 283 early dementia patients along cognitive and functional scores. Two distinct subgroups were identified that separated patients into 'slow' and 'fast' progressing individuals. These subgroups were externally validated and independently replicated in a dementia cohort comprising 2779 patients. We trained a machine learning model to predict the progression subgroup of a patient from cross-sectional data at their time of dementia diagnosis. The classifier achieved a prediction performance of 0.70 \u00b1 0.01 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in external validation. By emulating a hypothetical clinical trial conducting patient enrichment using the proposed classifier, we estimate its potential to decrease the required sample size. Furthermore, we balance the achieved enrichment of the trial cohort against the accompanied demand for increased patient screening. Our results show that enrichment trials targeting cognitive outcomes offer improved chances of trial success and are more than 13% cheaper compared with conventional clinical trials. The resources saved could be redirected to accelerate drug development and expand the search for remedies for cognitive impairment.",

        "AbstractText": "The brain-age gap, i.e. the difference between the brain age estimated from structural MRI data and the chronological age of an individual, has been proposed as a summary measure of brain integrity in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we aimed to determine the brain-age gap in genetic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease and its association with surrogate markers of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease pathology and with rates of cognitive and motor function decline. We studied 1200 cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort, including idiopathic Parkinson's disease, asymptomatic and clinical mutation carriers in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) and the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), and normal controls using a cohort study design. For comparison, we studied 187 Alzheimer's disease dementia cases and 254 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. We used Bayesian ANOVA to determine associations of the brain-age gap with diagnosis, and baseline measures of motor and cognitive function, dopamine transporter activity and CSF markers of Alzheimer's disease type amyloid-\u03b242 and phosphotau pathology. Associations of brain-age gap with rates of cognitive and motor function decline were determined using Bayesian generalized mixed effect models. The brain-age gap in idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients was 0.7 years compared to controls, but 5.9 years in Alzheimer's disease dementia cases. In contrast, asymptomatic LRRK2 individuals had a 1.1. year younger brain age than controls. Across all cases, the brain-age gap was associated with motor impairment and (in the clinically manifest PD cases) reduced dopamine transporter activity, but less with CSF amyloid-\u03b242 and phosphotau. In idiopathic Parkinson's disease cases, however, the brain-age gap was associated with lower CSF amyloid-\u03b242 levels. In sporadic and genetic Parkinson's disease cases, a higher brain-age gap was associated with faster decline in episodic memory, and executive and motor function, whereas in asymptomatic LRRK2 cases, a smaller brain-age gap was associated with faster cognitive decline. In conclusion, brain age was sensitive to Alzheimer's disease like rather than Parkinson's disease like brain atrophy. Once an individual had idiopathic Parkinson's disease, their brain age was associated with markers of Alzheimer's disease rather than Parkinson's disease. Asymptomatic LRRK2 cases had seemingly younger brains than controls, and in these cases, younger brain age was associated with poorer cognitive outcome. This suggests that the term brain age is misleading when applied to disease stages where reactive brain changes with apparent volume increases rather than atrophy may drive the calculation of the brain age.",

        "AbstractText": "Understanding the nature and onset of neurophysiological changes, and the selective vulnerability of central hub regions in the functional network, may aid in managing the growing impact of Alzheimer's disease on society. However, the precise neurophysiological alterations occurring in the pre-clinical stage of human Alzheimer's disease remain controversial. This study aims to provide increased insights on quantitative neurophysiological alterations during a true early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Using high spatial resolution source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography, we investigated regional and whole-brain neurophysiological changes in a unique cohort of 11 cognitively unimpaired individuals with pathogenic mutations in the presenilin-1 or amyloid precursor protein gene and a 1:3 matched control group (n = 33) with a median age of 49 years. We examined several quantitative magnetoencephalography measures that have been shown robust in detecting differences in sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients and are sensitive to excitation-inhibition imbalance. This includes spectral power and functional connectivity in different frequency bands. We also investigated hub vulnerability using the hub disruption index. To understand how magnetoencephalography measures change as the disease progresses through its pre-clinical stage, correlations between magnetoencephalography outcomes and various clinical variables like age were analysed. A comparison of spectral power between mutation carriers and controls revealed oscillatory slowing, characterized by widespread higher theta (4-8\u2005Hz) power, a lower posterior peak frequency and lower occipital alpha 2 (10-13\u2005Hz) power. Functional connectivity analyses presented a lower whole-brain (amplitude-based) functional connectivity in the alpha (8-13\u2005Hz) and beta (13-30\u2005Hz) bands, predominantly located in parieto-temporal hub regions. Furthermore, we found a significant hub disruption index for (phase-based) functional connectivity in the theta band, attributed to both higher functional connectivity in 'non-hub' regions alongside a hub disruption. Neurophysiological changes did not correlate with indicators of pre-clinical disease progression in mutation carriers after multiple comparisons correction. Our findings provide evidence that oscillatory slowing and functional connectivity differences occur before cognitive impairment in individuals with autosomal dominant mutations leading to early onset Alzheimer's disease. The nature and direction of these alterations are comparable to those observed in the clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, suggest an early excitation-inhibition imbalance, and fit with the activity-dependent functional degeneration hypothesis. These insights may prove useful for early diagnosis and intervention in the future.",

Emerging research suggests that long non-coding RNAs play a role in neural development and function. Nevertheless, the precise relationship between lncRNAs and Alzheimer's disease remains uncertain. The authors' recent discoveries have uncovered an unconventional mechanism involving the regulation of synaptic plasticity and the functioning of the hippocampal fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1)-neurotrophin 3 (NTF3) pathway, which is mediated by cancer susceptibility candidate 15 (CASC15). Subsequently, functional rescue experiments were performed to illustrate the efficient delivery of exosomes harboring a significant amount of 2610307p16Rik transcripts, which is the murine equivalent of human CASC15, to the hippocampal region of mice. This resulted in significant improvements in synaptic morphological plasticity and cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. Given the pivotal involvement of CASC15 in synaptic plasticity and the distinctive regulatory mechanisms of the CASC15-FMR1-NTF3 axis, CASC15 emerges as a promising biomarker for Alzheimer's disease and may even possess potential as a feasible therapeutic target.",

        "AbstractText": "A considerable amount of morbidity and disability are caused by a wide variety of neurological illnesses together referred to as neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are the most prevalent and have been thoroughly studied. The development of intervention techniques that focus on the unfavorable elements of these diseases, particularly those that could help halt their course, has become increasingly important. This study aims to explain the most current findings about the function of neurotrophins, the signaling pathways they follow in neurodegenerative illnesses, and their possible therapeutic applications. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 criteria served as the foundation for this systematic review. In April 2024, a thorough search was conducted through the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, PubMed, PubMed Central, and ScienceDirect databases. The predetermined criteria used to choose the research were the English language, narrative and systematic reviews,\u00a0observational studies, and randomized and non-randomized clinical trials published within the last ten years. Subsequently, each study type-specific quality assessment was conducted utilizing the available assessment method. Of the 3,322 studies found during the first search, 15 were ultimately chosen for inclusion in the final selection. One cohort, one non-randomized clinical trial, one randomized clinical trial, three meta-analyses and systematic reviews, and nine narrative reviews were included. This review has explained in detail the current understanding of how neurotrophins play an essential role in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, as well as their complex downstream signaling that leads to the process of neurodegeneration. Our study has also highlighted previous studies showing the efficacy of neurotrophins in clinical trials, but the data is limited; more preclinical and clinical studies are needed in this regard. These have also drawn our attention to future clinical trials that will address the challenges faced in their delivery and associated complications. Altogether, neurotrophins could serve as promising targets for therapeutic intervention that could stop or even reverse the development of neuropathology associated with neurodegenerative illnesses.",

        "AbstractText": "Protein citrullination (PC) is a posttranslational modification (PTM) that converts a peptidyl arginine into a peptidyl citrulline. Aberrant PC is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion disease, and multiple sclerosis. Common among these diseases is a dramatic increase of PC in reactive astrocytes. Some citrullinated proteins have been identified. The most prominent are astrocytic cytoskeletal proteins such as GFAP and vimentin, and myelin protein MBP. Recent investigation in ALS has revealed new changes, including a decreased PC in neurons and an association of PC with myelin protein aggregates. These findings suggest that PC contributes to protein aggregation, neuronal dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and axonal degeneration. However, how PC impact neurodegeneration remains to be understood. Further studies are needed to understand a range of questions, from how PC modulates individual protein functions to its impact on diseases. Because of the PC's robust changes in neurodegenerative diseases, there are also prospects that this PTM may be harnessed as biomarkers, and modulation of this PTM may be an avenue for therapy. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of PC in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases, the investigative methods for PC, and PC's potential as a biomarker and a therapeutic target.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (ad) is a progressive and degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that is associated with cognitive and memory impairment. The main factors which have been implicated in neurodegeneration of ad are oxidative stress and cholinergic neurons dysfunction. Here, we examined the effects of auraptene, a novel acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death in PC12 cells. METHODS: Thereby, we measured cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, AChE inhibitory activity, cell damage and apoptosis with AlmarBlue, 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), Ellman method, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, propidium iodide (PI) staining and western blot analysis, respectively. RESULTS: H2O2 (150\u00a0\u03bcM) resulted in the cell death and apoptosis while, pretreatment with auraptene (10, 20 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) significantly increased the viability (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and at 5-50\u00a0\u03bcM decreased ROS amount (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Pretreatment with auraptene (10, 20 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) lessened AChE activity (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and at 20 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM reduced the release of LDH (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and at (10, 20 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) diminished the percentage of apoptotic cells (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Also, pretreatment with auraptene at 10,20 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM prevented from poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and cytochrome c release (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The amount of caspase 3 activity (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and survivin (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were elevated after pretreatment of cells with auraptene at 10-50\u00a0\u03bcM and 10 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM. CONCLUSION: It seems that auraptene has the ability to slow down or stop H2O2-induced nerve cells death by reducing the activity of AChE and suppression of internal pathway of apoptosis.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder that courses with chronic neuroinflammation. Pleiotrophin (PTN) is an endogenous inhibitor of Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (RPTP) \u03b2/\u03b6 which is upregulated in different neuroinflammatory disorders of diverse origin, including AD. To investigate the role of RPTP\u03b2/\u03b6 in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, we used eight-to ten-month-old APP/PS1 AD mouse model. They were administered intragastrically with MY10, an inhibitor of RPTP\u03b2/\u03b6, at different doses (60 and 90\u00a0mg/kg) every day for 14\u00a0days. Treatment with 90\u00a0mg/kg MY10 significantly reduced the number and size of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques in the dorsal subiculum of the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In addition, we observed a significant decrease in the number and size of astrocytes in both sexes and in the number of microglial cells in a sex-dependent manner. This suggests that RPTP\u03b2/\u03b6 plays an important role in modulating A\u03b2 plaque formation and influences glial responses, which may contribute to improved A\u03b2 clearance. In addition, MY10 treatment decreased the interaction of glial cells with A\u03b2 plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, the analysis of proinflammatory markers in the hippocampus revealed that MY10 treatment decreased the mRNA levels of Tnfa and Hmgb1. Notably, treatment with MY10 increased Bace1 mRNA expression, which could be involved in enhancing A\u03b2 degradation, and it decreased Mmp9 levels, which might reflect changes in the neuroinflammatory environment and impact A\u03b2 plaque dynamics. These results support the therapeutic potential of inhibition of RPTP\u03b2/\u03b6 in modulating A\u03b2 pathology and neuroinflammation in AD.",

CP progression increases the risk of dementia and accelerates Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, risk diagnostic models and biomarkers for CP-related CI remain insufficient. Previous research has highlighted the relationships between several complete blood count parameters for CP or CI-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, while the specific values of complete blood count parameters in CP-related CI patients remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the correlation between complete blood count parameters and CP-related CI to establish a risk diagnostic model for the early detection of CP-related CI. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at West China Hospital, Sichuan University. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to classify patients into either the CP with CI group or the CP without CI group. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to screen the related factors of CP-related CI for constructing a risk diagnostic model, and the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The study ultimately included 163 eligible patients.

The diagnostic model was evaluated by the ROC curve, demonstrating good diagnostic value with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.803, a sensitivity of 0.603 and a specificity of 0.871.

There is increasing evidence that astrocytes are the primary targets of A\u03b2. A\u03b2 can cause abnormal synaptic glutamate, aberrant extrasynaptic glutamate, and astrocytic calcium dysregulation through astrocyte glutamate transporters facing the synaptic cleft (GLT-syn), astrocyte glutamate transporters facing the extrasynaptic space (GLT-ess), metabotropic glutamate receptors in astrocytes (mGluR), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in astrocytes (NMDAR), and glutamatergic gliotransmitter release (Glio-Rel). However, it is difficult to experimentally identify the extent to which each pathway affects synaptic glutamate, extrasynaptic glutamate, and astrocytic calcium signaling. Motivated by these findings, this work established a concise mathematical model of astrocyte  Ca 2 +   dynamics, including the above A\u03b2-mediated glutamate-related multiple pathways. The model results presented the extent to which five mechanisms acted upon by A\u03b2 affect synaptic glutamate, extrasynaptic glutamate, and astrocytic intracellular  Ca 2 +   signals. We found that GLT-syn is the main pathway through which A\u03b2 affects synaptic glutamate. GLT-ess and Glio-Rel are the main pathways through which A \u03b2 affects extrasynaptic glutamate. GLT-syn, mGluR, and NMDAR are the main pathways through which A\u03b2 affects astrocytic intracellular  Ca 2 +   signals.

Early detection of dementia and differential diagnosis between AD and FTD can lead to more effective management of the disease and contributes to the advancement of knowledge and potential treatments. In this approach, several features were extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of 36 subjects diagnosed with AD, 23 FTD subjects, and 29 healthy controls (HC). Mann-Whitney U-test and t-test methods were employed for the selection of the best discriminative features. The Fp1 channel for FTD patients exhibited the most significant differences compared to AD. In addition, connectivity features in the delta and alpha subbands indicated promising discrimination among these two groups. Moreover, for dementia diagnosis (AD\u2009+\u2009FTD vs. HC), central brain regions including Cz and Pz channels proved to be determining for the extracted features.

Care groups were introduced in the Netherlands to promote integration of chronic primary care, but it remains unknown to which degree they facilitate this. This study therefore aims to determine whether Dutch general practices perceive themselves to be capable of delivering integrated chronic care and uncover the role of care groups. METHODS: We performed a survey study amongst 39 care groups and 65 healthcare providers within general practices (GPs and nurse practitioners). RESULTS: 43% of healthcare providers within general practices are (very) dissatisfied with capabilities for chronic care to patients and 56% do not feel capable of delivering integrated care. Care groups and providers show alignment in their perception of some of the most important facilitators and barriers such as motivation and lack of time, but other factors are valued differently at both levels. DISCUSSION: Our findings show inability of general practices to deliver integrated chronic care despite a health system that is inherently supportive of care integration and point to a mismatch between barriers and facilitators amongst practices and care groups, resulting in providers partly relying on their motivation in accommodating integrated chronic care. CONCLUSION: General practices are not sufficiently supported by care groups and national policies in delivering integrated chronic care. The identified mismatch between policy and practice warrants redesign of support from care groups to align policies with identified barriers and facilitators at the provider level.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Understanding Healthcare Barriers for Latino/a/e/x Families with Alzheimer's Disease: Insights from Primary Care Provider interviews.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease and Related dementias (ADRD) are disproportionately underdiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and undertreated in Latino/a/e/x populations living in the U.S. Latino/a/e/x families also experience low access to ADRD caregiver support services and high levels of depression. Primary care providers (PCPs) are the first point of contact for patients and their families, and they are critical in understanding the factors associated with disparities in accessing services. This project aims to reflect on the barriers that Latino/a/e/x families experience in accessing and using healthcare services from the perspective of PCPs. METHODS: The data was collected through structured interviews with 23 diverse PCPs across the US via videoconference or phone calls. Participants were recruited via snowball sampling. Two reviewers used an inductive coding approach to conduct qualitative thematic analysis. The Rigorous and Accelerated Data Reduction (RADaR) technique was used to extract relevant data and organize it into relevant categories. RESULTS: Some of the themes identified reflect the experiences of individuals in the diagnostic process and subsequent care: 1) Family members are usually the first ones to notice the symptoms, 2) Delays in seeking care might be partially influenced by denial from individuals and their families, 3) Language congruency promotes the disclosure of symptoms, 4) Care that is linguistically and literacy appropriate requires additional support of patients and families, and 5) Caregiving expectations and preferences by Latino/a/e/x families do not shield caregivers from feeling burnout. Overall, PCPs reflected that the experiences of individuals are highly influenced by socioeconomic factors, which also influence their care plans. CONCLUSION: Most Latino/a/e/x older adults with ADRD will be cared for by a PCP at some point during their disease, which means that they require additional support and resources at primary care appointments to address the barriers to accessing care services and enhance health equity in Latino/a/e/x communities.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The associations of PM 2.5 mass and various adverse health outcomes have been widely investigated. However, fewer studies focused on the potential health impacts of PM 2.5 components, especially for dementia and Alzheimer's diseases (AD). METHODS: We constructed a nationwide population-based open cohort study among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older during 2000-2018. This dataset was linked with the predicted levels of 15 PM 2.5 components, including 5 major mass contributors (EC, OC, NH 4 + , NO 3 - , SO 4 2- ) and 10 trace elements (Br, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Ni, Pb, Si, V, Zn) across contiguous US territory. Data were aggregated by ZIP code, calendar year and individual level demographics. Two mixture analysis methods, weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) and quantile g-computation (qgcomp), were used with quasi-Poisson models to analyze the health effects of the total mixture of PM 2.5 components on dementia and AD, as well as the relative contribution of individual components. RESULTS: Exposure to PM 2.5 components over the previous 5 years was significantly associated with increased risks of both dementia and AD, with stronger associations observed for AD. SO 4 2- , OC, Cu were identified with large contributions to the combined positive association of the mixture from both WQS and qgcomp models. CONCLUSION: We found positive associations between the 15 PM 2.5 components and the incidence of dementia and AD. Our findings suggest that reducing PM 2.5 emissions from traffic and fossil fuel combustion could help mitigate the growing burden of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "MOTIVATION: This study aims to develop an AI-driven framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate scientific reasoning and peer review to predict efficacious combinatorial therapy when data-driven prediction is infeasible. RESULTS: Our proposed framework achieved a significantly higher accuracy (0.74) than traditional knowledge-based prediction (0.52). An ablation study highlighted the importance of high quality few-shot examples, external knowledge integration, self-consistency, and review within the framework. The external validation with private experimental data yielded an accuracy of 0.82, further confirming the framework's ability to generate high-quality hypotheses in biological inference tasks. Our framework offers an automated knowledge-driven hypothesis generation approach when data-driven prediction is not a viable option.

        "ArticleTitle": "Prioritizing Parkinson's disease risk genes in genome-wide association loci.",
        "AbstractText": "Recent advancements in Parkinson's disease (PD) drug development have been significantly driven by genetic research. Importantly, drugs supported by genetic evidence are more likely to be approved. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful tool to nominate genomic regions associated with certain traits or diseases, pinpointing the causal biologically relevant gene is often challenging. Our aim was to prioritize genes underlying PD GWAS signals. The polygenic priority score (PoPS) is a similarity-based gene prioritization method that integrates genome-wide information from MAGMA gene-level association tests and more than 57,000 gene-level features, including gene expression, biological pathways, and protein-protein interactions. We applied PoPS to data from the largest published PD GWAS in East Asian- and European-ancestries. We identified 120 independent associations with P < 5\u00d710-8 and prioritized 46 PD genes across these loci based on their PoPS scores, distance to the GWAS signal, and presence of non-synonymous variants in the credible set. Alongside well-established PD genes (e.g., TMEM175 and VPS13C), some of which are targeted in ongoing clinical trials (i.e., SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA1), we prioritized genes with a plausible mechanistic link to PD pathogenesis (e.g., RIT2, BAG3, and SCARB2). Many of these genes hold potential for drug repurposing or novel therapeutic developments for PD (i.e., FYN, DYRK1A, NOD2, CTSB, SV2C, and ITPKB). Additionally, we prioritized potentially druggable genes that are relatively unexplored in PD (XPO1, PIK3CA, EP300, MAP4K4, CAMK2D, NCOR1, and WDR43). We prioritized a high-confidence list of genes with strong links to PD pathogenesis that may represent our next-best candidates for disease-modifying therapeutics. We hope our findings stimulate further investigations and preclinical work to facilitate PD drug development programs.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Single-Nucleus Atlas of Cell-Type Specific Genetic Regulation in the Human Brain.",
        "AbstractText": "Genetic risk variants for common diseases are predominantly located in non-coding regulatory regions and modulate gene expression. Although bulk tissue studies have elucidated shared mechanisms of regulatory and disease-associated genetics, the cellular specificity of these mechanisms remains largely unexplored. This study presents a comprehensive single-nucleus multi-ancestry atlas of genetic regulation of gene expression in the human prefrontal cortex, comprising 5.6 million nuclei from 1,384 donors of diverse ancestries. Through multi-resolution analyses spanning eight major cell classes and 27 subclasses, we identify genetic regulation for 14,258 genes, with 857 showing cell type-specific regulatory effects at the class level and 981 at the subclass level. Colocalization of genetic variants associated with gene regulation and disease traits uncovers novel cell type-specific genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and other disorders, which were not detectable in bulk tissue analyses. Analysis of dynamic genetic regulation at the single nucleus level identifies 2,073 genes with regulatory effects that vary across developmental trajectories, inferred from a broad age range of donors. We also uncover 1,655 genes with trans-regulatory effects, revealing distal regulation of gene expression. This high-resolution atlas provides unprecedented insight into the cell type-specific regulatory architecture of the human brain, and offers novel mechanistic targets for understanding the genetic basis of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) or ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) is associated with cognitive impairment. However, the relationship between retinal asymmetry and cognitive frailty (CF) remains unknown. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-two community-dwelling older adults were assessed starting in 2015 and underwent biennial cognitive and frailty evaluations until 2022. Retinal asymmetry was defined as the absolute interocular retinal difference. Generalized linear mixed models estimated the risk of CF over time. RESULTS: Among the participants, 158 completed the 4-year follow-up. Greater baseline GC-IPL asymmetry was associated with worsening CF over time (adjusted odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a01.03, 1.10), with handgrip strength asymmetry significantly modifying this association (pinteraction\u00a0=\u00a00.02). GC-IPL asymmetry was associated with cognitive impairment (  \u03b2 \u0302 $\\hat{\\beta }$  =\u00a0-1.69\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-2; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-3.13\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-2, -0.25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-2) but not with physical frailty. RNFL showed no significant association with CF. DISCUSSION: Interocular GC-IPL asymmetry might be a new biomarker for CF in older adults. HIGHLIGHTS: Interocular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) asymmetry was associated with impaired memory-frailty, with handgrip strength asymmetry significantly modifying this association. Interocular GC-IPL asymmetry was associated with cognitive impairment. Interocular retinal asymmetry might be a structural biomarker of cognitive frailty.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: We aimed to identify unique proteomic signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). METHODS: We conducted a comparative proteomic analysis of 33 post mortem brains from AD, DLB, and\u00a0PDD individuals without dementia focusing on prefrontal, cingulate, and parietal cortices, using weighted gene co-expression network analyses with differential enrichment analysis. RESULTS: Network modules revealed hub proteins common to all dementias. Lewy body dementias differed from AD by reduced levels of the autophagy protein p62 (SQSTM1), whereas DLB was distinguished from both AD and PDD by altered TRIM33 and cysteine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11) across brain regions. An increase in mitochondrial and synaptic proteins was related to better cognition whereas enrichment in the\u00a0extracellular matrix, complement system, and autophagy proteins was associated with greater cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION: Our study offers valuable insights into the network-based biomarker characterization of molecular signatures of AD, DLB, and PDD. HIGHLIGHTS: Reduced levels of the autophagy protein p62 (SQSTM1) differentiated Lewy body dementias from Alzheimer's disease (AD) across multiple brain regions. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) was distinguished from both AD and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) by altered TRIM33 and cysteine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11) levels across brain regions. Key mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins (e.g., COX7A2, TOMM40L, NDUFV1), and synaptic proteins (e.g., GABRB3, GABRB2, GLUA3, GLUA4, SNAP47, dynamin1) were more abundant in preserved cognitive states. Extracellular matrix proteins and members of the complement system (decorin, biglycan, C4A, C4B) showed a\u00a0strong positive correlation with cognitive decline.",
