        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Palliative care addresses the comprehensive needs of advanced-stage cancer patients, enhancing their quality of life. However, due to cultural and linguistic differences, Chinese Australians encounter substantial barriers to accessing these services. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the barriers preventing Chinese Australians from accessing palliative care services. METHODS: Surveys and interviews were conducted with Chinese Australian cancer patients and their caregivers to assess their awareness, understanding, and challenges related to palliative care. RESULTS: Among 136 surveyed and eight interviewed participants, a significant lack of awareness and numerous misconceptions about palliative care were evident, with language as the primary barrier despite strong interest in such services. DISCUSSION: The results indicate a need to improve the awareness and accessibility of palliative care for the Chinese Australian community. Local health authorities and medical associations should collaborate in developing and disseminating culturally and linguistically appropriate information to increase service uptake among ethnic groups in Australia.",

        "AbstractText": "Biomarker enrichment clinical trial designs are versatile tools to assess the treatment effect and increase the efficiency of clinical trials. In this paper, we propose a two-stage enrichment clinical trial design with survival outcomes, and consider the situation where the biomarker assay and classification are possibly subject to errors. Specifically, the first stage is a randomized design, stratified by the biomarker appeared status. Depending on the result of the interim analysis and a pre-specified futility criterion, the second stage can be either enriched with only the biomarker appeared positive patients, or remain as the stratified design with both biomarker appeared positive and biomarker appeared negative patients. Compared to continuous and binary outcomes, test statistics to account for biomarker misclassification are much more complicated and require special care. We develop log-rank statistics for the interim and final analyses, with an adjustment for the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker assay. Control of Type I error rate is achieved by considering correlations between adjusted log-rank statistics from the same and/or different stages. R code is developed to calculate critical values, global/marginal power, and sample size. Our method is illustrated with examples of a recently successful development of immunotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Neoadjuvant systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: challenges and opportunities-a narrative review.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers with high mortality rate worldwide. Surgical resection, liver transplantation (LT), and thermal ablation are primary curative methods for early-stage HCC. However, the high recurrence rate following surgical intervention is the primary factor contributing to the unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, the critical aspect in improving the overall survival of HCC lies in reducing the postoperative recurrence rate. This review is aimed at summarizing the current evidence base regarding the safety and efficacy of systemic therapy administered in the neoadjuvant context for patients with resectable HCC. Furthermore, we will offer a perspective on the potential future trajectories of systemic therapy as a neoadjuvant modality in the management of HCC. METHODS: We searched PubMed with terms: hepatocellular carcinoma, neoadjuvant, preoperative, chemotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, targeted therapy, systemic therapy, immunotherapy. Relevant ongoing clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov are included. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: In the context of resectable solid organ cancers, neoadjuvant therapy is frequently administered to delay disease progression, ensure appropriate patient selection, reduce tumor burden and potentially eradicate micrometastases prior to surgical procedures. In recent years, the advancements in systemic therapy for advanced HCC, especially with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy combination, have significantly contributed to notable improvements in overall survival. These breakthroughs have prompted the exploration and implementation of systemic therapy in the setting of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for HCC. In this review, we aim to briefly summarize the current available evidence on the safety and efficacy of systemic therapy in neoadjuvant settings designed to improve the outcome of curative-intent liver resection or LT for patients with resectable HCC. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and issues that need to be further clarified before widespread adoption of neoadjuvant therapies, providing an outlook on future directions of systemic therapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant therapy involving immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, seems to exhibit the most promising characteristics of preventing recurrence and improving long-term survival of HCC patients following curative hepatectomy or LT, especially when combined with anti-angiogenic therapies and locoregional therapy. Further research is needed to identify suitable candidates, predictive biomarkers, optimal regimens for neoadjuvant therapy, and ideal timing for surgery.",

        "AbstractText": "Our study aimed to analyze the correlation of cancer-related parameters with tumor regression grade (TRG) and disease-free survival (DFS) by gender in 192 rectal cancer patients operated on after neoadjuvant long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT). Preoperative diagnostics revealed no significant gender differences in any clinical parameters other than obesity (p=0.031). We found that slightly overweight men had a lower incidence of distant metastases (p=0.042). The post-LCCRT pathologic finding showed that women had more positive lymph nodes (ypN, p=0.002) while no other pathologic parameter differed significantly between the genders. Overall, a poor response to therapy correlated with a shorter time to disease progression (p=0.002). Women achieved ypN0 in 50% of cases, but only 27% had a good TRG compared to 40.5% of men (p=0.073). Women had a worse DFS than men, even when complete response to therapy was achieved (p=0.003), and greater depth of residual tumor invasion (ypT, p=0.035) and higher ypN (p=0.002) correlated with shorter DFS. Positive resection margins (p<0.001), higher ypN stage (p=0.003), and poor TRG (p=0.025) correlated with shorter DFS in men. We conclude that women have a poorer response to LCCRT with the possibility that therapeutic approach to the neoadjuvant treatment of rectal cancer may be gender-specific.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is a highly malignant and lethal tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis which raised the need to identify other prognostic factors for better patient risk stratification. Tumor budding (TB), defined as isolated single cancer cells or small clusters of up to four cells at the invasive front, is an emerging histoprognostic factor associated with aggressiveness in various malignancies. This study investigated the prognostic significance of tumor budding (TB) in pancreatic carcinoma using artificial intelligence. METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected all cases of PC diagnosed (2008-2022). TB was assed using 2 methods: manual on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) slides and semi-automated using QUPATH software. The selected slide for each case was digitalized using NIS software version 4.00 connected to the microscope NIKON (Eclipse Ni-U). The pathological images were then incorporated into QUPATH. The budds were counted using cell count functionality based on the nucleus size and pixel variability, and TB scores were categorized as BUDD1(0-4), BUDD2(5-9) and BUDD3(\u226510). We analyzed the association between the TB score and prognostic clinicopathological factors and overall survival. RESULTS: 25 patients were included (mean age:62.3years;male-to-female ratio:2.57). TB was found in 100%of cases and a high TB score (BUDD2-3) was observed in 56%of cases (using QUPATH versus 48% using HE slides); statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two methods (p=0.589). A high TB score was associated with older age (>72 years), ductal histological subtype and advanced stage (pT>2).53.8% of patients with lymph node metastasis or advanced stage had high TB score. Multivariate analysis revealed that TB score was strongly and independently associated with overall survival (OS), with a hazard ratio of 2.35. CONCLUSION: TB is an additional prognostic factor in PC, and using artificial intelligence via QUPATH software offers a promising and accessible tool for pathologists to evaluate TB and to improve risk stratification in patients with PC.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: As Portugal exhibits some of the highest gastric cancer rates in Europe, optimizing the Helicobacter pylori eradication rate is imperative. We aimed to describe H. pylori treatment regimens in Portugal, within a real clinical practice setting. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of the Portuguese patients diagnosed with H. pylori between May 2013 and December 2022, within the European Registry on Helicobacter pylori Management (Hp-EuReg). The demographic and clinical data, diagnostic methods, treatment regimens, and prescription trends with their effectiveness were analysed by modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 700 cases, mainly from 2 centres (98% of cases), were included, with 59% females, with a mean age of 54 \u00b1 15 years. Treatment-na\u00efve patients encompassed 81% of cases. Overall compliance (>90% drug intake) was reported in 99% of cases. Overall effectiveness was 87%, by both mITT and PP analyses. The triple PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin therapy decreased from 29% in 2013 to 0% in 2022. Conversely, both quadruple concomitant PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin-metronidazole and PPI-bismuth-metronidazole-tetracycline therapies were predominantly used from 2016 onwards, with PPI-bismuth-metronidazole-tetracycline representing 76% of all prescriptions in 2022, achieving an overall mITT effectiveness of 92% and 91%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In Portugal, concomitant quadruple therapy with PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin-metronidazole and bismuth quadruple with PPI-bismuth-metronidazole-tetracycline provided both optimal (>90%) effectiveness, in line with results of other Southern European countries.",

CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 58-year-old male with chronic hepatitis C virus infection who presented with a voluminous shoulder HCC metastasis. Albeit an initial significant biochemical response with 1L sorafenib, progressive disease after 3 months plus a bleeding complication led to treatment discontinuation. Second-line nivolumab, although yielding a rapid clinical and biochemical response, was permanently ceased after 12 weeks due to a grade 3 immune-related hepatitis. Notably, 5 years post-treatment, the patient sustains a major biochemical and radiographic response.

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess disease burden and cost of illness of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Portugal, assuming full adherence to the treatment algorithm associated to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system. METHODS: An individual-level, continuous-time, state-transition model was used to simulate the progression of HCC patients through the BCLC disease stages. Health state transition rates were derived from the published literature. An expert panel provided further information on Portuguese epidemiology and clinical practice, including treatments and other healthcare resources utilization at each disease stage. Unit costs for health resources were collected from national public sources. HCC associated costs and outcomes were estimated over a 5-year time horizon. RESULTS: Over the 5-year horizon of this study, the projections of HCC annual prevalence (including patients in remission) show an increasing trend, rising from 4,151 in 2023 to 4,851 in 2027. Despite the slight reduction in the predicted annual mortality rate (from 29.8% to 28.7%), we estimated that HCC could still lead to a total of 120,314 years of life lost due to premature mortality in the Portuguese population. Costs attributed to HCC were predicted to rise from around EUR 70 million in 2023 up to around EUR 77 million in 2027. Around 44.3% of these costs are related to HCC systemic treatment and 29.0% related to liver transplantation costs. CONCLUSION: HCC's increasing prevalence trend will continue to impose substantial disease burden in terms of premature mortality, with more than 20,000 years of life lost per year in the Portuguese population. Consequently, costs attributed to HCC are expected to rise despite the reduction on mortality by full adherence to the BCLC treatment algorithm. Continuing high disease burden and substantial cost of illness urge for a need of a comprehensive and effective healthcare interventions, as well as adequate resource allocation for HCC.",

In contexts like Georgia, smoke-free homes (SFHs) can play crucial roles in reducing secondhand smoke exposure and use prevalence. OBJECTIVES: This study examined barriers and facilitators to SFHs among Georgian adults. METHODS: In February-March 2024, focus groups were conducted separately with smoking and nonsmoking adults in 2 rural communities (n=25; Mage=42.92, 52.0% female, 48.0% married). Data were examined using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Smoking participants (n=13) were primarily (84.6%) male; nonsmoking participants (n=12) were primarily (91.7%) female. Despite 72.2% reporting complete SFH restrictions, several exceptions and implementation challenges were noted. Smoking was commonly allowed for certain people (e.g., guests) or rooms/spaces (e.g., kitchen, balcony). Salient challenges included prevalent male smoking, difficulty changing behavior (smoking in general and smoking in the home), noncompliance, and accommodating guests, older extended family members, and important traditions and celebrations. However, important SFH motives were the health of non-smokers, particularly children, and serving as good role models for children. CONCLUSIONS: Effective SFH interventions for Georgian households must address specific characteristics (e.g., high male smoking rates, hospitality, accommodating important traditions) and may serve as models for other countries with similar characteristics.",

Stroke is more frequent in underdeveloped countries, where ischemic stroke is one of the most common kinds. Therefore, it is imperative to unravel the processes of ischemic stroke in more depth and develop novel therapeutics to combat the condition. Polyphenols provide a significant preventive role against multiple diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, atherosclerosis, brain dysfunction, and stroke. METHODS: In the current investigation, computational tools including Swiss Target prediction, DisGeNET, SwissADME, pkCSM, Cytoscape, InterActiVenn, STRING database, and DAVID database were utilized to identify the signaling pathways, putative targets, along with associated genes of the polyphenols for stroke prevention. RESULTS: This study revealed the possible interactions between the disease targets for Stroke and the selected plant-based polyphenols. Docking results also exhibited the strong to moderate affinity of the selected ligands (Apigenin, Ellagic acid, Ferulic acid, Kaempferol, Genistein, Luteolin, Naringenin, and Quercetin) towards the selected disease target. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the neuroprotective role of selected polyphenols through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Further studies are required to investigate additional molecular mechanisms between the polyphenols and their derivatives against pathological targets of Stroke.",

However, studies have showed daratumumab induction therapy reduced CD34+\u2009stem cell yield and increased dependence on plerixafor use during mobilization therapy for subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Here, we aim to explore the influence of daratumumab-based induction therapy on CD34+\u2009stem cell yield in Indian multiple myeloma patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, electronic medical records of transplant eligible multiple myeloma patients (n\u2009=\u200991) between December 2015 and February 2023 were considered. Clinical information about induction therapy, mobilization therapy, stem cell collection and transplant status were collected. Data analysis was done using SPSS v.26, with statistical significance at p\u2009<\u20090.05. RESULTS: Among the 91 patients, 8 received daratumumab induction regimen. The CD34+\u2009stem cell yield among daratumumab and non-daratumumab induction groups did not show significant difference (5.29\u2009\u00b1\u20091.64\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 versus 6.08\u2009\u00b1\u20093.11\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CD34+\u2009cells/kg; p\u2009=\u20090.101).

Quadruple amputation secondary to symmetrical peripheral gangrene is a rare clinical scenario posing challenges in rehabilitation. Literature regarding rehabilitation of persons with multiple amputations is limited. This case describes the rehabilitation of a 57-year-old lady suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia who underwent quadruple amputation. She had undergone bilateral transtibial and bilateral transradial amputation after vasopressor-induced symmetrical peripheral gangrene. In view of expected guarded level of functional independence, ambulatory independence was the primary goal at admission to Department of PMR. The various steps taken in rehabilitation and modifications made to assistive devices are described in this article. Challenges faced during various phases of training, and subsequent ambulation are detailed in this article. Overcoming limitations, the client was made to be an indoor ambulator with appropriate prostheses and mobility aids. She was partially independent for activities of daily life after in-patient rehabilitation. The background of leukaemia and subsequent chemotherapy also affected the rehabilitation of this patient. Although various studies have described cases of quadruple amputation rehabilitation achieving functional independence and ambulation, the absence of specific guidelines and protocols make rehabilitation of persons with multiple amputations inefficient. This case study also shows the need for personalized goal setting for persons with multiple amputations. Realistic goal setting, psychological counselling, and an interdisciplinary approach are imperative in rehabilitation of persons with quadruple amputation. Flexible functional scales specific to persons with multiple amputations are necessary to evaluate such persons objectively. Studies with larger sample size, longer follow-ups, and comprehensive review of existing literature are needed to standardize rehabilitation of quadruple amputation and evaluate the various factors that may affect rehabilitation outcome.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic may be considered as a shared source of uncertainty. Prolonged engagement with social media regarding this uncertainty could present as a risk factor for anxiety. We sought to investigate the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty, dimensions of resilience, uncertainty source (pandemic)-related social media use, and the risk of anxiety and depression in patients with cancer. METHOD: Patients with solid organ cancer (n=113) completed the sociodemographic data form, the Intolerance to Uncertainty Scale-12 (IUS-12), the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) between May and August 2020. RESULTS: Depression scores were high at 17.7% of the patients while anxiety scores were high at 49.6%. RSA and its dimensions significantly differ between the Anxiety and Depression groups determined by the HADS. Time spent on social media about the COVID-19 pandemic (SMT) was associated with higher HADS-Anxiety scores (r=0.26, p<0.01), whereas higher resilience was associated with lower HADS- Anxiety (r=-0.42, p<0.01) and HADS-Depression (r=-0.52, p<0.01) scores. In addition to high levels of intolerance of uncertainty, low levels of the social resources were found to be a risk factor for depression, and low levels of self- and future-perception dimensions were found to be a risk factor for anxiety, regardless of the patients' social media use. CONCLUSION: As the factors that fuel uncertainty will always have an affect on cancer patients and cancer care, promoting the patients' resilience resources should be one of the main priorities for cancer patients.",

METHOD: Blood samples were taken from patients diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) who applied to Mersin Provincial Health Directorate Toros State Hospital Alcohol and Drug Addiction Treatment Center (AMATEM) between 01.09.2019-01.09.2020 and hepatitis virus markers, complete blood count and basic biochemistry were assessed. Sociodemographic Evaluation Form, Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Childhood Traumas Scale, Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT), Temps-A Temperament Scale, Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale were applied to 107 patients with HCV and 101 patients without HCV who were selected by systematic sampling and the findings obtained were compared. RESULTS: Of the 1190 patients diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder, 340 (28.5%) were found to be HCV positive. 107 HCV-positive and 101 HCV- negative patients who were selected for comparison were similar in terms of sociodemographic characteristics. Among HCV positive patients, the rate of intravenous drug use and needle sharing were significantly higher (p<0.001, p<0.001). Overall duration of substance use and intravenous substance use were significantly higher in HCV positive patients (p=0.024 and p=0.017). Similarly, HCV positive group were significantly more likely (p<0.001) to have heard of HCV before and significantly more likely (p=0.009) to know that HCV causes cirrhosis and liver cancer. Regarding the scores of Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Childhood Traumas Scale, Substance Use Disorder Recognition Test, DUDIT, Temps -A Temperament Scales applied to HCV positive and HCV negative patients with Opioid Use Disorder, no difference was found. The scores of the 'Non-Acceptance' factor of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale were found to be significantly higher in HCV positive patients with Opioid Use Disorder (p=0.020). CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) have higher rates of HCV positivity compared to general public. Intravenous drug use significantly increases this risk. Half of HCV-positive patients were unaware that they have the virus and only a very small proportion received treatment. Therefore, examining each patient with OUD for HCV, treating positive patients in an effective referral system seems to be the an important step in the eradication of this disease in this population.",

There is no definitive method for intraoperative diagnosis of this complication. METHOD: We studied on CND indicated 17 thyroid cancer patients (14 female, 3 male, age range: 21-67, mean age: 43.4). The excised CND material was kept in 50 ml of normal saline for 30 minutes. A 2 ml sample was taken from this fluid and sent to biochemistry for rapid parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurement. RESULTS: PTH values were <10pg/mL in 14 patients. PTH values of three patients were very high (112pg/mL, 167pg/mL, 210pg/mL respectively). When the excised tissue in these patients was evaluated intraoperatively with loop glasses, one parathyroid tissue was found in each of the three cases and these were autotransplanted intramuscularly. After this procedure we kept CND tissue material again in another normal saline of 50mL in 30 minutes and PTH was measured. The values came back as <10pg/mL. No parathyroid gland was found in any case in the postoperative routine histopathological evaluation. No patient had symptoms of hypocalcemia during the eight-weeks postoperative follow-up. CONCLUSION: Inadvertent parathyroidectomy due to CND is a serious complication. This complication can be prevented with the simple method we recommend here.",

In recent years, several guidelines have recommended a more individualized, risk-based approach aiming for a more conservative treatment plan. Despite this paradigm shift, there is a gap between recommendations and actual clinical practice as many centers continue to advocate the more aggressive treatment model. De-escalating the care of selected patients with thyroid cancer include the avoidance of surgery in tumours < 10 mm, the recommendation for thyroid lobectomy for tumours < 4cm, the avoidance of prophylactic lymph node dissection. Evidence based studies show that such strategies do not worsen long-term outcomes, can reduce complications and can lead to better quality of life.

In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the U.S., which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood haematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukaemia and lymphoma.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Detecting clinically unsuspected lung cancer on chest radiographs is challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI) software that performs comparably to radiologists may serve as a useful tool. PURPOSE: To evaluate the lung cancer detection performance of a commercially available AI software and to that of humans in a healthy population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study used chest radiographs from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial in the United States between November 1993 and July 2001 with pathological cancer diagnosis follow-up to 2009 (median 11.3\u2009years). The software's predictions were compared to the PLCO radiologists' reads. A reader study was performed with a subset comparing the software to 3 experienced radiologists. RESULTS: The analysis included 24\u200a370 individuals (mean age 62.6 \u00b1 5.4; median age 62; cancer rate 2%), with 213 individuals (mean age 63.6 \u00b1 5.5; median age 63; cancer rate 46%) for the reader study. AI achieved higher specificity (0.910 for AI vs. 0.803 for radiologists, P\u2009<\u2009.001), positive predictive value (0.054 for AI vs. 0.032 for radiologists, P\u2009<\u2009.001), but lower sensitivity (0.326 for AI vs. 0.412 for radiologists, P\u2009=\u2009.001) than the PLCO radiologists. When we calibrated the sensitivity of AI to match it with the PLCO radiologists, AI had higher specificity (0.815 for AI vs. 0.803 for radiologists, P\u2009<\u2009.001). In the reader study, AI achieved higher sensitivity than readers 1 and 3 (0.608 for AI vs. 0.588 for reader 1, P\u2009=\u2009.789 vs. 0.588 for reader 3, P\u2009=\u2009.803) but lower specificity than reader 1 (0.888 for AI vs. 0.905 for reader 1, P\u2009=\u2009.814). Compared to reader 2, AI showed higher specificity (0.888 for AI vs. 0.819 for reader 2, P\u2009=\u2009.153) but lower sensitivity (0.888 for AI vs. 0.905 for reader 1, P\u2009=\u2009.814). CONCLUSION: AI detects lung cancer on chest radiographs among asymptomatic individuals with comparable performance to experienced radiologists.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: To correlate sensory dysfunction with adverse pathologic factors for tongue cancers and determine the survival prognosticators. METHODS: We prospectively collected data on the pain sensation (Brief Pain Inventory), gustation (NIH Taste Intensity Test), proprioception (Two-point and light touch discrimination) from patients with squamous carcinoma of oral tongue, surgically treated between July 2021 and September 2022, and stratified them based on pT stage. The pathologist was blinded to the clinical data and correlation with the sensory dysregulations was obtained using a multivariate analysis. Factors predicting overall survival (OS) and disease specific survival (DSS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: 100 patients were followed up with a median of 13\u00a0months. Radiating pain predicted advanced disease, extranodal extension (ENE) and perineural invasion (PNI). Loss of sweet and salty taste were associated with advanced disease, Depapillation and PNI. Among early tumors, 26% had taste alterations, with loss of sweet taste significantly associated with Depapillation and PNI. Loss of light touch was significantly associated with presence of PNI, while loss of two-point discrimination was associated with larger tumors, PNI and poor grade. The OS was significantly reduced when pain scores were moderate to severe at their least within 24\u00a0h from interview and loss of light touch. CONCLUSION: Radiating pain, sweet and salty taste dysregulation and loss of sensory discrimination have a strong correlation with PNI and impact survival.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Current management of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) based on dysplasia grading is controversial. The malignant transformation rate of OPMDs does not correlate well with dysplasia grading, resulting in non-standardized treatment for patients. A quantitative biomarker-based risk score (qBRS; trade name StraticyteTM) was previously developed to address shortcomings related to the current standard of care. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study consisting of biopsied OPMDs was used to validate qBRS for predicting transformation of OPMDs to OSCC. MATERIALS & METHODS: Three hundred and two cases were immunostained, imaged, and analyzed via qBRS. A binary prognostic risk was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve optimizing sensitivity and specificity. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the cumulative probability of lack of malignant transformation for patients with elevated or normal biomarker-based risk. RESULTS: The results demonstrated very high sensitivity (96.2%) and negative predictive value (96.2%) for qBRS. Elevated risk scores had higher predicted probabilities of transformation to cancer, independent of dysplasia grade. CONCLUSIONS: qBRS can be a useful clinical adjunct tool to dysplasia grading for the assessment of malignant transformation potential, providing a quantitative metric in OPMDs. The addition of qBRS to current histological techniques should improve early detection rates of OSCC, enhancing the effectiveness of treatment.",

They can cause a pheochromocytoma crisis that manifests with arterial blood pressure oscillations, and subsequent symptoms and signs of catecholamine overproduction. There are many potential triggers of this condition. This report presents a 33-year-old man with an obvious pheochromocytoma crisis that occurred due to beta-blocker application without a concomitant alpha-blocker. The crisis was treated with high doses of urapidil, and once permanent hemodynamic stabilization was achieved, urapidil was replaced with phenoxybenzamine. This report demonstrates that pheochromocytoma crisis can be successfully treated with urapidil but further consideration is needed on the use of urapidil both in pheochromocytoma crisis and preoperative management of pheochromocytoma patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are two main groups of drugs for targeted treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Inhibition of angiogenesis and other growth pathways that are pivotal for tumor progression lead to significant improvement of survival in patients with mRCC. The main aim of this study was to compare the effects of temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitor) and interferon alpha-2a (IFN-alpha-2a) on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with T3 stage mRCC who developed lung metastasis in the first two years after radical nephrectomy. A total of 60 patients diagnosed with T3 stage renal cancer who developed metastases in the lungs within two years after radical nephrectomy were included in a prospective study conducted at the Department for Urology, Clinical Center of Vojvodina and partially retrospective study at the Oncology Institute in Sremska Kamenica. Patients were divided into two groups consisting of 30 patients according to treatment with temsirolimus or IFN-alpha. During the first year of treatment, OS of patients treated with temsirolimus was 23.33%, whereas in patients treated with IFN-alpha it was 16.67%. Median survival in patients treated with temsirolimus was 9.3 months, whereas in patients treated with IFN-alpha it was 6.9 months, yielding a statistically significant difference (p=0.028). Patients treated with temsirolimus showed a statistically significantly longer median PFS compared to patients treated with IFN-alpha (p<0.0085). In conclusion, temsirolimus therapy had a significantly positive effect on survival in patients with mRCC.

The most common symptoms include headaches, palpitations, and sweating. Because of a diverse clinical presentation, pheochromocytomas pose a major diagnostic challenge and often go unidentified. These tumors can occur sporadically or as a part of hereditary syndromes. The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring plasma and 24-hour urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and functional morphological examinations are used for tumor localization. The treatment is operative and requires special preoperative patient preparation to prevent hypertensive crisis and arrhythmias. Due to the possibility of recurrence, the patient needs to be monitored. Pheochromocytoma has a high fatality rate if not recognized on time due to the effect of catecholamines on the cardiovascular system.",

This study aimed to examine the correlation between CD86 and CD163 macrophage expression and clinical-pathological characteristics of the disease in patients operated on for pancreatic carcinoma. A retrospective research was conducted in which the archival materials of the Ljudevit Jurak Department of Pathology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center were used together with all relevant patient clinical data obtained from the Hospital Information System on 76 patients operated on for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In our study, the number of CD86 macrophages and the CD86/CD163 ratio showed a statistically significant correlation with increasing T and N stages of the disease. The number of CD163 macrophages did not show a statistically significant correlation with the mentioned variables. These results indicated that in our clinical conditions, proinflammatory (M1) macrophages were more expressed in locally advanced tumor stages with worse long-term prognoses.

This study was designed as a retrospective prognostic study combining standard histopathologic parameters with tumor budding and microsatellite instability. The study included 89 patients on elective treatment for stage II primary colorectal adenocarcinoma from January 2011 to December 2015. Study results indicated that the prognosis of patients with stage II CRC depended on the combination of three factors, (in the order of importance): number of lymph nodes examined; total number of buds per 0.785 mm2 (\u22655.5); and positive lymphovascular invasion. There is increasing evidence that tumor biology and non-anatomic characteristics are important in the prognosis and treatment of CRC. One of them is tumor budding which is not yet an integral part of the AJCC staging system. A low number of the lymph nodes examined is associated with high-risk patients. All patients without an adequate number of lymph nodes examined (less than 8 lymph nodes) should a priori be considered a very high-risk group, with a very low survival rate, and chemotherapy should be used.",

We compared ERUS findings with postoperative pathological data in 41 patients with endoscopic and pathological (PH) diagnosis of rectal cancer. These patients underwent ERUS examination to determine the extent of the disease and the findings were subsequently compared with postoperative pathological diagnosis. After ERUS examination, there were three patients in group T0, five in group T1, 12 in group T2, 17 in group T3, two in group T4, and two patients had a mucinous metastatic type of cancer. After excluding 15 patients who met the exclusion criteria, we compared ERUS findings of 26 patients with their pathological diagnosis to determine the sensitivity and accuracy of ERUS. The total sensitivity of the ERUS in preoperative staging of the tumor stage T0-T4 was 96%. Accuracy was 89%. This study showed that a surgeon can rely on the findings of ERUS performed by an experienced endoscopist before deciding of type of surgical procedure for T0-T2, and even T3 degree of rectal cancer.

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed and Embase databases to identify related English-language studies published within the last 10 years. Key search words included \"upper urinary tract tumour/cancer/carcinoma\", \"kidney-sparing surgery or approach\", \"endoscopic treatment for upper tract tumour/cancer/carcinoma\", \"topical instillation in the upper urinary tract\", and \"urinary marker for urothelial carcinoma\". References within the identified literature were explored and evaluated for relevance. RESULTS: KSS is recommended for both low-risk and selected high-risk UTUC with imperative indications such as solitary kidney. Studies have shown comparable oncological outcomes after KSS including endoscopic ablation, segmental ureterectomy, and topical instillation of novel agents when compared to radical nephroureterectomy in well-selected cases. The development of novel diagnostic tools and risk-stratifying models allows optimal case selection for KSS without compromising oncological outcomes. CONCLUSION: Kidney-sparing approach for UTUC is an evolving and promising area in urologic oncology, driven by advances in technology, better diagnostic tools, and novel therapeutic agents. Our article provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements and clinical recommendations.

METHODS: Literature search was made using PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Wiley Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival rate, which was addressed by a systematic review and meta-analysis. The risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. RESULTS: The evidence is consistent in showing that 5-year survival of trimodality therapy is similar to radical cystectomy in selected patients, ranging between 29% and 73%. Patients undergoing bladder-sparing therapy were found to have better outcomes in terms of quality of life and sociability than those undergoing radical cystectomy. Immunotherapy is establishing itself as a strategy for organ-preservation treatment, showing complete response rates between 42% and 100%. However, most of these results have been obtained from ongoing clinical trials. Furthermore, there are still no studies comparing the efficacy among the different available therapies. CONCLUSION: Although radical cystectomy remains the gold standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, its significant morbidity has prompted the exploration of alternative therapies. In this context, bladder preservation therapies, though supported by limited literature, emerge as a potential alternative that could offer comparable oncological outcomes in selected patients.",

METHODS: From January 2018 to December 2022, cT2cN0M0 PCa patients who underwent prostate biopsies and subsequent RARP at the Peking University First Hospital with an interval between biopsy and RARP of \u226490 days were included. Univariable and stepwise multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors associated with APCs. Nomograms were constructed based on these predictive models. The performance of the nomograms was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves, decision curve analyses, and calibration plots. RESULTS: A total of 423 eligible cT2cN0M0 PCa patients were included. The rates of upgrading, upstaging, and PSM in our cohort were 33%, 51%, and 35%, respectively. The stepwise multivariate logistic analysis suggested that PSA density and the percentage of positive cores in systematic biopsy were significantly associated with the occurrence of APCs. The score of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, PSA density, and the International Society of Urological Pathology grade group (IGG) of needle-biopsy specimens (or clinical IGG [cIGG]) were significantly associated with upgrading. The PSA density, percentage of positive cores in systematic biopsy, and largest tumor percentage in all cores of each patient (LTP) were significantly associated with upstaging. The PSA density and LTP were significantly associated with the PSM. Based on these results, four nomograms were developed. Receiver operating characteristic curves, decision curve analyses, and calibration plots implied that the nomograms exhibited excellent accuracy.

The pT3b was linked to higher death likelihood (OR 7.16, 95% CI 1.38-37.23, p=0.019), while moderate EZH2 expression did not show statistical significance (OR 4.54, 95% CI 0.87-23.60, p=0.072, marginally). Pathological regional lymph node stage (pN) 1 had significantly higher probability of mortality than pN unknown (3.9% vs. 27%, p<0.001). PCa in the neck and apex of the prostate gland increased death risk tenfold. CONCLUSION: Sufficient immunoexpression of EZH2, ductal carcinoma component, and neoplastic proliferation in the seminal vesicles, apex and neck of the prostate gland correlates with elevated risks of recurrence and mortality. Clinicians should use these criteria for appropriate patient referrals, and a multicenter trial could provide accurate classifications.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Diagnostic interval/delay (DI) denotes the duration between first presentations to healthcare provider to the definitive diagnosis of cancer. Prolonged DI is a major contributor to deaths among children with malignancies in low-middle-income countries (LMICs). The data on DI and factors affecting it are limited from LMIC. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled patients/children<12 years with proven/suspected malignancies. Children already on definitive chemotherapy, who died before a definitive diagnosis and with benign tumours were excluded. The parents or caregivers were interviewed individually using a customized questionnaire. Various intervals in referral chain like patient interval/delay (PI), DI and treatment interval/delay (TI) and factors affecting DI were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 120 eligible children; 79 with median age 43 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 28-81) were analyzed. Haematological malignancies (n = 40) and non-haematological malignancies (n = 39) were equally distributed. Median total delay was 74 days (14-88 days). Median DI was 17 days (IQR: 8-54). The main contributor to delay was due to referral delay by primary and secondary physician (p < 0.05). The median PI was 2 day (IQR: 0-7.5) and median TI was 1 day (IQR: 0-4). Prolonged DI (DI > 30 days) was seen in 33 (41.8%) children. Trial of alternative medicine was the only significant factor associated with prolonged DI in univariate and multivariate analysis with odds ratio of 6.24. Other demographic, socioeconomic, health-seeking journey and disease-related factors were not found to be associated with prolonged DI. CONCLUSIONS: Significant delay exists in paediatric cancer management in LMIC. Augmentation of physician and parental awareness is the key to decrease these delays.",

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: To report a rare case of uveal melanoma (UM) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome in a patient who underwent whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify the possible genetic cause of the disease. METHODS: A 54-year-old patient was referred to the eye clinic at the Rassoul Akram Hospital in 2016 due to complaints of blurry vision. In addition to UM, he later developed retinal capillary hemangioblastomas in his eye and a central nervous system hemangioblastoma. Proband had a family history of prostate cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. After analyzing the Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the VHL genes, no mutations were found, leading to the decision to perform WES. RESULTS: WES disclosed a heterozygous known pathogenic nonsense variant: c.274C>T (p.Arg92*) in exon 3 of gene FCGR1A. CONCLUSIONS: Our examination indicated that FCGR1A: c.274C>T (p.Arg92*) may have contributed to the co-occurrence of UM and VHL disease. In the future, FCGR1A could be a promising therapeutic approach for retinal cancer due to its role in several cancers and retinal degeneration. To gain a better understanding of its pathogenesis mechanism, it is recommended to conduct functional analysis using appropriate animal models before using the variant in genetic counseling.",

We introduced an open-source, specialized LLM for ophthalmology, termed Language Enhanced Model for Eye (LEME). LEME was initially pre-trained on the Llama2 70B framework and further fine-tuned with a corpus of ~127,000 non-copyrighted training instances curated from ophthalmology-specific case reports, abstracts, and open-source study materials. We benchmarked LEME against eight other LLMs, namely, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, three Llama2 models (7B, 13B, 70B), PMC-LLAMA 13B, Meditron 70B, and EYE-Llama (another ophthalmology-specific LLM). Evaluations included four internal validation tasks: abstract completion, fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice questions (MCQ), and short-answer QA. External validation tasks encompassed long-form QA, MCQ, patient EHR summarization, and clinical QA. Evaluation metrics included Rouge-L scores, accuracy, and expert evaluation of correctness, completeness, and readability. In internal validations, LEME consistently outperformed its counterparts, achieving Rouge-L scores of 0.20 \u00b1 0.03 in abstract completion (all p<0.05), 0.82 \u00b1 0.04 in fill-in-the-blank (all p<0.0001), and 0.22 \u00b1 0.05 in short-answer QA (all p<0.0001, except versus GPT-4). In external validations, LEME excelled in long-form QA with a Rouge-L of 0.19 \u00b1 0.01 (all p<0.0001), ranked second in MCQ accuracy (0.68 \u00b1 0.09; all p<0.0001), and scored highest in EHR summarization and clinical QA (ranging from 4.24 to 4.83 out of 5 for correctness, completeness, and readability). LEME's emphasis on robust fine-tuning and the use of non-copyrighted data represents a breakthrough in open-source ophthalmology-specific LLMs, offering the potential to revolutionize execution of clinical tasks while democratizing research collaboration.",

With the rapid advancement of GenAI technologies, including large language models (LLMs), healthcare institutions face unprecedented opportunities and challenges. This research explores the current status of GenAI integration, focusing on stakeholder roles, governance structures, and ethical considerations by administering a survey among leaders of health institutions (i.e., representing academic medical centers and health systems) to assess the institutional readiness and approach towards GenAI adoption. Key findings indicate a diverse range of institutional strategies, with most organizations in the experimental phase of GenAI deployment. The study highlights significant variations in governance models, with a strong preference for centralized decision-making but notable gaps in workforce training and ethical oversight. Moreover, the results underscore the need for a more coordinated approach to GenAI governance, emphasizing collaboration among senior leaders, clinicians, information technology staff, and researchers. Our analysis also reveals concerns regarding GenAI bias, data security, and stakeholder trust, which must be addressed to ensure the ethical and effective implementation of GenAI technologies. This study offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of GenAI integration in healthcare, providing a roadmap for institutions aiming to leverage GenAI for improved quality of care and operational efficiency.",

        "AbstractText": "Polyamines are regulatory metabolites with key roles in transcription, translation, cell signalling and autophagy1. They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels2. Polyamines have been linked to pain showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models3. However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. In undertaking a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK-Biobank we found significant association with variants mapping to the SLC45A4 gene locus. In the mouse nervous system SLC45A4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron sub-types within the dorsal root ganglion including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, whilst the cryo-EM structure reveals a novel regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat and algogen induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of peptidergic nociceptors. Our findings thus establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a new target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Tyrosine phosphorylations are a prominent characteristic of numerous cancers, necessitating the use of computational tools to comprehensively analyze phosphoproteomes and identify potentially (dys)functional phosphorylations. Here we propose a machine learning-based method to predict the thermodynamic stability change resulting from tyrosine phosphorylation. Our approach, based on prediction of phosphomimetic delta-delta-G from structural features, strongly correlates with experimental mutational scanning cDNA proteolysis data (R = 0.71). We predicted the destabilizing effects of all 384,857 tyrosine residues from the Alphafold2 database. We then applied our approach to a pan-cancer phosphoproteomics dataset, comprising over 600 unique tyrosine phosphorylations across 11 cancer subtypes. We predict destabilizing phosphorylations in both oncogenes and tumor suppressors, where the former likely reflects a generalized relief of auto-inhibition or activating conformational change. We find that the number of circuit topological parallel relations with respect to residues contacting the phosphorylated site is greater for autoinhibited oncogenes than for other proteins (Wilcoxon p = 0.03). Utilizing an extreme gradient-boosting machine learning approach, we obtain an AUC of 0.85 for the prediction of autoinhibited phosphorylation states from circuit topological features. The top destabilized proteins from the pan-cancer data are enriched for chemical and oxidative stress pathways. Among metabolic proteins, highly destabilizing phosphorylations tend to occur in more peripheral proteins with lower network centrality measures (Wilcoxon p = 0.005). We predict 58% of recurrent tyrosine cancer phosphorylations to be destabilizing at the 1 kcal/mol threshold. Our approach can enable rapid screening of destabilizing phosphorylations and phosphomimetic mutations.",

        "AbstractText": "Bacterial symbionts are critical members of many marine sponge holobionts. Some sponge-associated bacterial lineages, such as Poribacteria, SAUL, and Tethybacterales appear to have broad host ranges and associate with a diversity of sponge species, while others are more species-specific, having adapted to the niche environment of their host. Host-associated spirochete symbionts that are numerically dominant have been documented in several invertebrates including termites, starfish, and corals. However, dominant spirochete populations are rare in marine sponges, thus far only observed in Clathrina clathrus and various species within the Latrunculiidae family, where they are co-dominant alongside Tethybacterales symbionts. This study aimed to characterize these spirochetes and their potential role in the host sponge. Analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes from eight latrunculid sponges revealed that these unusual spirochetes are relatively recent symbionts and are phylogenetically distinct from other sponge-associated spirochetes. Functional comparative analysis suggests that the host sponge may have selected for these spirochetes due to their ability to produce terpenoids and/or possible structural contributions.",

        "AbstractText": "The spindle cells of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) lesions primarily express Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) latent genes with minimal expression of lytic genes. However, recent transcriptome analyses of KS lesions have shown high expression of KSHV open reading frame (ORF) 75, which is considered a late lytic gene based on analyses in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) lines. ORF75 encodes a pseudo-amidotransferase that is part of the viral tegument, acts as a suppressor of innate immunity, and is essential for viral lytic replication. We assessed a representative KS lesion by RNAscope and found that ORF75 RNA was expressed in the majority of latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA)-expressing cells. Luciferase fusion reporter constructs of the ORF75 promoter were analyzed for factors potentially driving its expression in KS. The ORF75 promoter construct showed high basal transcriptional activity in vitro in endothelial cells, mediated by a proximal consensus specificity protein 1 (Sp1) (GGGGCGGGGC) element along with two distal CCAAT boxes. Sp proteins formed complexes with the proximal consensus Sp1 element to activate ORF75 promoter transcription. We also found evidence that a repressive factor or factors in B cells, but not endothelial or epithelial cells, interacted with more distal elements in the ORF75 promoter region to repress constitutive ORF75 expression in B cells. Alternate forms of Sp1 were found to accumulate during latency and showed substantial enrichment during viral lytic replication in PEL cells and infected endothelial cells, but their functional significance is unclear. We also found that ORF75 can in turn upregulate its own expression and that of other KSHV genes. Thus, while ORF75 acts primarily as a lytic gene in PEL cell lines, Sp proteins induce substantial constitutive ORF75 transcription in infected endothelial cells and this can account for its high expression in KS lesions.",

        "AbstractText": "Lactate plays a critical role in the tumor microenvironment, driving tumor progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. Despite its importance, in vivo quantification of lactate using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has faced challenges, primarily due to the overlapping lipid signal at 1.3 ppm. Current clinical practice employs a long echo time to exploit differences in T2 relaxation between lactate and lipids; however, this approach significantly suppresses signals from other metabolites. Lipid has a notably different T1 relaxation time than lactate and other metabolites, which may be exploited by an inversion recovery sequence to better distinguish them. However, this method has not found wide use because of the loss of signal in other metabolites. Here we introduce a selective inversion pulse with a short echo time MRS method (SPIR-PRESS), which mitigates this issue. In phantom experiments, SPIR-PRESS successfully suppressed lipid signals that could be misinterpreted as lactate in short TE PRESS spectra, while maintaining sensitivity to the full metabolite profile. SPIR-PRESS demonstrated superior performance in quantifying lactate compared to long echo time PRESS, with ~ 60 % increase in sensitivity for lactate detection compared to conventional PRESS with a 288 ms TE. In a mouse glioma model, SPIR-PRESS clearly detected lactate and other key tumor metabolites (choline, creatine, NAA) in the tumor, which were not detectable in conventional long TE PRESS. These findings highlight SPIR-PRESS as a promising technique for improved lactate quantification and comprehensive metabolite profiling in tumor environments.",

We demonstrate that TkNat10's catalytic activity is critical for T. kodakarensis fitness at elevated temperatures. Unlike eukaryotic homologs, TkNat10 exhibits robust stand-alone activity, modifying diverse RNA substrates in a temperature, ATP, and acetyl-CoA-dependent manner. Transcriptome-wide analysis reveals TkNat10 preferentially modifies unstructured RNAs containing a 5'-CCG-3' consensus sequence. Using a high-throughput mutagenesis approach, we define sequence and structural determinants of TkNat10 substrate recognition. We find TkNat10 can be engineered to use non-native acyl-CoA donors, providing insight into its cofactor specificity. Finally, we demonstrate TkNat10's utility for site-specific acetylation of RNA oligonucleotides, enabling analysis of ac4C-dependent RNA-protein interactions. Our findings establish a framework for understanding archaeal RNA acetylation and a new tool for studying the functional consequences of ac4C in diverse RNA contexts.",

To test this, we combined cancer genomic analysis with extensive molecular dynamics simulations of mTOR oncogenic variants.

However, how the CD225 domain controls membrane trafficking was unknown. We reveal that the CD225 domain contains a SNARE-like motif that enables interaction with cellular SNARE fusogens. Proline rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) encodes a SNARE-like motif that enables interaction with neuronal SNARE proteins, and mutations therein disrupt SNARE binding and are linked to neurological disease. Another CD225 member, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), protects cells against Influenza A virus infection. IFITM3 interacts with SNARE proteins that mediate late endosome-late endosome (homotypic) fusion and late endosome-lysosome (heterotypic) fusion. IFITM3 binds to syntaxin 7 (STX7) in cells and in vitro, and mutations that abrogate STX7 binding cause loss of antiviral activity against Influenza A virus. Mechanistically, IFITM3 disrupts assembly of the SNARE complex controlling homotypic fusion and accelerates the trafficking of endosomal cargo to lysosomes.

Computing millions of estimates in large cohorts in which small effect sizes and tight confidence intervals are expected, necessitates minimizing model-misspecification bias to increase power and control false discoveries. We present TarGene, a unified statistical workflow for the semi-parametric efficient and double robust estimation of genetic effects including $ k $-point interactions among categorical variables in the presence of confounding and weak population dependence. $ k $-point interactions, or Average Interaction Effects (AIEs), are a direct generalization of the usual average treatment effect (ATE). We estimate genetic effects with cross-validated and/or weighted versions of Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimators (TMLE) and One-Step Estimators (OSE). The effect of dependence among data units on variance estimates is corrected by using sieve plateau variance estimators based on genetic relatedness across the units. We present extensive realistic simulations to demonstrate power, coverage, and control of type I error. Our motivating application is the targeted estimation of genetic effects on trait, including two-point and higher-order gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, in large-scale genomic databases such as UK Biobank and All of Us. All cross-validated and/or weighted TMLE and OSE for the AIE $ k $-point interaction, as well as ATEs, conditional ATEs and functions thereof, are implemented in the general purpose Julia package TMLE.jl.

DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted PubMed, MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and meeting abstract libraries (International Gynecological Cancer Society, Society of Gynecologic Oncology, American Society of Clinical Oncology) from 1994, the year of the first published laparoscopic clinical study in ovarian cancer, to May 2024. Studies that compared minimally invasive surgery with laparotomy for staging of ovarian cancer and reported perioperative or survival outcomes data were included. Single-arm studies, case studies, meeting abstracts, and studies involving borderline tumors, fertility-sparing surgery, or management of recurrent disease were excluded. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Three authors independently screened citations for relevance and inclusion and exclusion criteria and assessed the risk of bias of individual studies using the methodologic index for nonrandomized studies criteria for nonrandomized studies. TABULTATION INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: From a total of 2,777 identified citations, 36 nonrandomized studies were included: 21 early-stage, five primary debulking for advanced stages, seven interval debulking after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and three with heterogeneous populations. No randomized studies were identified. For early-stage cancer, nine studies found no difference in progression-free survival (risk ratio [RR] 1.05, 95% CI, 1.00-1.10, I 2=34.7%, P=.151), and 12 studies found no difference in overall survival (RR 1.00, 95% CI, 0.98-1.03, I 2=49.7%, P=.025). For primary debulking of advanced disease, rate of optimal debulking (five studies) (RR 1.11, 95% CI, 1.00-1.25, I 2=41.5%, P=.144) slightly favored minimally invasive techniques. For interval debulking, there was no difference in rates of optimal debulking (five studies) (RR 1.03, 95% CI, 0.96-1.11, I 2=54.6%, P<.051) between the two surgical modalities. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of observational studies in this analysis with a fair amount of bias warrants caution in the interpretation of the findings. However, minimally invasive surgery may offer some perioperative advantages over laparotomy and may be an acceptable alternative for selected patients. For early-stage disease, there was no difference in survival outcomes between minimally invasive surgery and laparotomy. For those with advanced disease, rates of optimal debulking were similar.

RESULTS: Five patients, seven clinicians, and five research staff were interviewed. Patients and clinicians reported that telehealth, remote testing, and medication delivery positively affected quality of life by reducing financial burden, wait times, and transportation needs. Interviewees did not report telehealth-related changes in treatment-related adverse effects, referrals for urgent evaluation, or compromise of privacy but expressed concerns about the lack of physical examinations. Patients reported that telehealth increased scheduling burden without negative effects on care quality, counseling comprehension, relationships with trial teams, or satisfaction. Clinicians and research staff reported improved workflows regarding remote consent, sponsor interactions, and documentation but challenges with virtual patient education and off-site testing. Clinicians highlighted disparities for patients with limited technology access and reported institutional and insurance-based telehealth policies as barriers. Survey responses supported qualitative findings. CONCLUSION: Despite notable limitations, patients, research staff, and clinicians recommended continued utilization of telehealth and remote clinical trial operations in clinical trials. Future clinical trial designs should consider telehealth inclusion.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Effects of Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery Subspecialty Training on Outcomes of Hysterectomy for Benign Indications.",
        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To compare surgical outcomes among patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign indications with minimally invasive gynecologic surgery subspecialists (MIGS group), gynecologic oncologists (GO group), and general obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYN group). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study from a quaternary care academic hospital. We included patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign reasons from 2015 to 2020. Exclusion criteria were malignant, premalignant, or suspected malignant condition, pelvic mass (other than leiomyoma), concomitant correction of pelvic organ prolapse, and peripartum hysterectomy. The primary outcome was the odds of a composite of any intraoperative or postoperative complications by surgeon group. Secondary outcomes were conversion to laparotomy, estimated blood loss, and admission times by surgeon subspecialty. RESULTS: A total of 946 hysterectomies were performed during the study period, of which 356 (37.6%) were performed by obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns), 220 (23.3%) by gynecologic oncologists, and 370 (39.1%) by minimally invasive gynecologic surgeons. Abdominal hysterectomies were performed in 36.8% of cases in the OB-GYN group and 30.0% of cases in the GO group, compared with 0.3% of cases in the MIGS group (P<.001). Intraoperative and postoperative complications occurred in 11.9% of cases in the MIGS group, 18.2% of cases in the GO group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.79, 95% CI, 1.14-2.08), and 20.8% of cases in the OB-GYN group (aOR 1.64, 95% CI, 1.01-2.69). Conversion to laparotomy occurred in 0.3% of cases in the MIGS group, 7.1% of cases in the GO group, and 7.6% of cases in the OB-GYN group (P<.001). Estimated blood loss, total admission time from surgery to discharge, and total days of hospitalization were all lower in the MIGS group compared with the other two groups (P<.001 for all comparisons). The aOR for same-day discharge was independently lower in the GO group (0.50, 95% CI, 0.29-0.86) and the OB-GYN group (0.23, 95% CI, 0.15-0.33) compared with the MIGS group. CONCLUSION: Fellowship-trained minimally invasive gynecologic surgery subspecialists had lower rates of perioperative complications for hysterectomy for benign indications compared with gynecologic oncologists and ob-gyns. Minimally invasive gynecologic surgery cases were also associated with fewer rates of laparotomy, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stays.",

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who turned 66 years old between 2010 and 2019 at two large health care systems located in Dallas, Texas, and Boston, Massachusetts, from the METRICS (MultilEvel opTimization of the ceRvIcal Cancer Screening process in diverse Settings & populations) Research Center, part of the PROSPR II (Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process) consortium. The primary outcomes were 1) the percentage of patients who were eligible for screening exit at age 66 years after adequate documented negative screening history (at least three consecutive negative cytology test results or two consecutive negative human papillomavirus [HPV] test or co-test results [cytology+HPV testing] within the prior 10 years) and 2) the worst pathology or cytology outcome documented in the cohort after age 65 years. RESULTS: Among 42,393 people who turned 66 years old while in the METRICS cohort, approximately 75.7% (n=32,094) were not eligible to exit screening at age 66 years, primarily because too few screening tests were documented (n=29,354, 91.5% of those ineligible). Furthermore, only 4,037 patients at both sites had 10 years of prior observation within the health care system, meaning data from current and prior health care delivery sites would be needed to assess exit eligibility for more than 90% of the cohort. Patients remained in the cohort after their 66th birthday on average for 3.8 years (interquartile range 2.0-6.5 years), and most (79.3%) had no subsequent evaluation after their 66th birthday. Among those ineligible to exit due to insufficient screening history, 83.7% were not subsequently screened. Of the 16.3% who were screened, 90 (1.9%) were diagnosed with cancer or high-grade precancerous lesions, including 34 (0.7%) who were diagnosed with cervical cancer. By contrast, among patients eligible to exit with sufficient screening history, 34.3% had at least one subsequent cytology or pathology result or both, and high-grade precancerous lesions or cervical cancer were diagnosed in only 0.6% (n=16). CONCLUSION: Data documented in the medical record are often insufficient to meet guidelines for exiting cervical cancer screening.",

        "AbstractText": "We develop a quantile regression decomposition (QRD) method for analyzing observed disparities (OD) between population groups in socioeconomic and health-related outcomes for complex survey data. The conventional decomposition approaches use the conditional mean regression to decompose the disparity into two parts, the part explained by the difference arising from the different distributions in the explanatory covariates and the remaining part, which is unexplained by the covariates. Many socioeconomic and health outcomes exhibit heteroscedastic distributions, where the magnitude of observed disparities varies across different quantiles of these outcomes. Thus, differences in the explanatory covariates may account for varying differences in the OD across the quantiles of the outcome. The QRD can identify where there are greater differences in the outcome distribution, for example, 90th quantile, and how important the covariates are in explaining those differences. Much socioeconomic and health research relies on complex surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), that oversample individuals from disadvantaged/minority population groups in order to provide improved precision. QRD has not been extended to the complex survey setting. We improve the QRD approach proposed in Machado and Mata (2005) to yield more reliable estimates at the quantiles, where the data are sparse, and extend it to the complex survey setting. We also propose a perturbation-based variance estimation method. Simulation studies indicate that the estimates of the unexplained portions of the OD across quantiles are unbiased and the coverage of the confidence intervals are close to nominal value. This methodology is used to study disparities in body mass index (BMI) and telomere length between race/ethnic groups estimated from the NHANES data.",

RESEARCH QUESTION: Does racialized economic segregation play a role in NSCLC treatment and outcomes and contribute to racial disparities? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study included non-Hispanic White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients with NSCLC diagnosed between 2007 and 2015 and identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset. County-level racialized economic segregation was estimated using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE). Multilevel logistic regression and multilevel Cox regression accounting for county-level clustering were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for late-stage diagnosis and treatment underutilization, and hazard ratio (HR) for mortality. RESULTS: Of 203,441 patients, 85.8% were NHW and 14.2% were NHB. Compared with patients living in the counties with the highest concentration of high-income NHW households (lowest ICE quintile), patients living in the counties with the highest concentration of low-income NHB households (highest ICE quintile) had higher risks of late-stage diagnosis (OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.16; P trend <.001), underutilization of guideline-recommended treatment (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.16-1.41; P trend <.0001), lung cancer-specific mortality (HR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.07-1.14; P trend <.0001), and overall mortality (HR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.09-1.16; P trend <.0001). The association between segregation and treatment underutilization was stronger in NHW than NHB patients (Pinteraction =0.02). There was no significant difference in the segregation-related risk of late-stage diagnosis, lung cancer-specific mortality, or overall mortality between NHW and NHB patients. INTERPRETATION: Living in segregated, low-income NHB counties had adverse impacts on early detection, treatment, and outcomes of NSCLC. However, residential segregation did not explain the excess risks of NSCLC care underutilization and mortality in NHB patients compared with NHW patients.",

The aim of our systematic review was to assess the types and the impact of psychosocial or behavioral interventions for cancer survivorship among Asian Americans and Asian immigrants globally. The review included 18 articles reporting data from eight interventions, of which five were randomized controlled trials and three were one-group design interventions. All interventions were conducted with Asian Americans and fell into three categories: (a) expressive writing interventions that facilitated individual cognitive and emotional processing, (b) educational and social support interventions, and (c) healthy lifestyle interventions. Expressive writing studies that involved writing tasks facilitating emotional and stress disclosure and cognitive reappraisal were most beneficial for Chinese American survivors, and both in-person and longer virtual educational and social support interventions yielded improvements for survivors. The healthy lifestyle intervention was more beneficial for the mental health than the physical health of survivors. The small number of interventions in the United States and the lack of interventions with Asian immigrants outside of the United States highlights the need for more survivorship interventions for Asian cancer survivors. Successful cultural adaptation of cancer survivorship interventions often required multiple studies and extensive time and resources. The early success of culturally adapted interventions shows the path forward in developing effective survivorship interventions for Asian Americans and for testing and disseminating interventions among various cancer types and Asian subgroups in future research.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The Role of PET Scan in Conscious Rats With Neuropathic Pain: Differential Changes in Brain Glucose Metabolic Activity in Spontaneous Versus Allodynia Pain.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain is caused by lesions in the somatosensory nervous system. Pain occurs spontaneously, and responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli are pathologically amplified. Despite the abundant functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in awake human subjects, there is no available report on the behavioral correlate of differential brain areas involved in spontaneous and evoked pain symptoms in a conscious animal model. We investigated whether positron emission tomography (PET) imaging could depict the spatial changes in glucose metabolic activity in the awake male rat brain during spontaneous- and evoked-pain conditions on a spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain. METHODS: Two major branches of the sciatic nerve, the tibial and common peroneal nerves, were transected under anesthesia. Two PET experiments were performed. In the spontaneous pain behavior group, abnormal paw-lifting behaviors were recorded during fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake. In the allodynia group, the ipsilateral side of the lesion hindpaw was stimulated with a 6-g von Frey fi lament once every 5 seconds for 20 minutes during FDG uptake. Each rat was scanned twice in both experiments: once before and once from 3 to 7 days after SNI surgery. Nerves were isolated but not transected in the sham-operated control group. RESULTS: After SNI surgery, rats displayed spontaneous jerky paw lifting and mechanical sensitization lasting at least 4 weeks. In the spontaneous pain behavior group, glucose metabolic activity in the SNI condition significantly increased in the ipsilateral posterior insular cortex (PIC) compared to pre-surgery and the sham-operated controls. The glucose metabolic activity of the PIC was linearly correlated with the frequency of spontaneous paw lifting. In the allodynia group, changes in glucose metabolic activities in the SNI condition significantly increased in the bilateral primary somatosensory cortex, contralateral secondary somatosensory cortex, contralateral primary motor cortex, ipsilateral secondary motor cortex, ipsilateral rostral insular cortex, PIC, hypothalamus, medial thalamus (including the medial dorsal nucleus and anterior periventricular thalamic nucleus), and medial cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS: Differential brain areas in rats with peripheral neuropathic pain were activated between mechanical hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain-related behaviors. The data suggest that PET is a useful imaging technique to establish the link between behavioral correlates and topographical representation in awake rats suffering from spontaneous pain and allodynia of neuropathic pain.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Anesthesia for interventional bronchoscopy (IB) presents significant challenges, primarily due to unpredictable responses such as coughing, airway spasms, and desaturation, even with monitored anesthetic care. However, the nociception inducing such responses and the impact of adding topical anesthesia (TA) have rarely been investigated. This study aims to map the timing and intensity of nociception, determine TA onset, and clarify TA's role in blocking nociception with subsequent IB procedures. METHODS: Analgesia nociception index (ANI) and mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) were collected in patients undergoing IB procedures with bispectral index (BIS)-controlled intravenous anesthesia. Data were compared and analyzed along with various stages: anesthetic induction with iGel insertion, fibro-optic bronchoscopy (FOB) insertion, and applying TA with the spray-as-you-go (SAYGO) method using xylocaine, up to 30 minutes with subsequent IB procedures. RESULTS: Data from 82 patients were analyzed. Under BIS-controlled anesthesia, iGel insertion decreased ANI significantly (P < 0.001). Following stabilization, ANI decreased significantly with SAYGO (P < 0.001), returned toward baseline within 5 minutes, and remained stably higher than baseline for up to 30 minutes. The changes on MBP were similar to those of ANI. No significant correlations were observed between BIS levels and ANI. CONCLUSIONS: ANI offers a valuable perspective on nociception, serves as a helpful reference for precise anesthetic management for IB. The key action, such as an ultrashort-acting anesthetic just before FOB insertion to block nociception from the establishment of TA without prolonged effect, is suggested for smooth, subsequent IB procedures.",

In this review, we focus on genomic content and activation as two fundamental factors associated with translocation formation and selection. While emphasizing the critical role of double-strand breaks and interchromosomal contacts in translocation formation, we discuss that selective advantage is likely the main driver shaping translocation landscapes in health and disease. Finally, we address that it remains difficult to disentangle the effect of translocation formation from the influence of selective pressure, and point out that unraveling their separate contribution in future studies will be key to better understand early tumorigenesis.",

        "AbstractText": "SIGNIFICANCE: Photoacoustic imaging has the potential to improve non-invasive breast cancer diagnosis. However, illumination through the skin introduces a skin tone bias, as greater melanin content increases optical absorption and can create acoustic clutter, reducing the visibility of various target sizes. AIM: We investigate the impact of skin tone bias as a function of target sizes in three photoacoustic image reconstruction methods: fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based reconstruction, delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming, and short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) beamforming. METHODS: The three imaging methods were applied to channel data from multidomain simulations with 757, 800, and 1064 nm wavelengths, 11 target sizes (ranging 0.5 to 3 mm), 18 skin tones [ranging individual typology angles (ITAs) of -54 deg to 60 deg], and a previously validated realistic 3D breast model. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) were measured to assess visibility. RESULTS: With 757 and 800 nm wavelengths, targets underlying dark skin tones (ITA range: -54 deg to -33 deg) with sizes \u22643 mm were poorly visible with \u22642.38 to 4.21 mean SNR and \u22640.46 to 0.74 mean gCNR, with smaller targets generally being more visible with lighter skin tones. A 1064-nm transmit wavelength improved visualization with DAS and SLSC beamforming, relative to both FFT reconstruction with a 1064 nm wavelength and DAS or SLSC beamforming with 757 and 800 nm wavelengths. When combined with SLSC beamforming, the 1064-nm wavelength offered the greatest improvements, enabling visualization of simulated target sizes ranging from 0.5 to 3 mm underlying very light (ITA = 60 deg) to dark (ITA = -54 deg) skin tones, with mean SNR \u226410.01 and mean gCNR \u22641. Visualization of simulated vessel structures derived from in vivo photoacoustic images was consistent with simulation-based target size expectations.

ONJ is a serious complication that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and preventive measures utilization of ONJ among cancer patients treated with antiresorptive agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study investigated 210 adult patients with cancer on either zoledronic acid (ZA) or denosumab at a tertiary cancer center. The primary endpoint was to determine the incidence rate of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw. Secondary endpoints were to determine the utilization rate of antiresorptive agent related ONJ preventive measures and the exposure duration of antiresorptive agents to the ONJ incidence. RESULTS: Of 210 patients, 68 were on zoledronic acid (group 1) and 142 were maintained on denosumab (group 2). The median incidence rate of medication related ONJ (MRONJ) was 3.8\u00a0% (8 out of 210), with 4.4\u00a0% (3 out of 68) in the first group and 3.5\u00a0% (5 out of 142) in the second group.

The utilization rate of ONJ preventive measures was 5.2\u00a0%, including regular dental check-ups (3.3\u00a0%) and oral hygiene education (1.9\u00a0%). The median duration of exposure before ONJ was 1\u00a0year for zoledronic acid and 2\u00a0years for denosumab. Risk factors included female sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Duration of Denosumab exposure, but not ZA, was associated with incidence of ONJ. CONCLUSION: Higher incidence rate of ONJ among denosumab-treated group. The findings emphasize the importance of female sex, diabetes, and hypertension as significant risk factors. The use of preventive measures was found to be low, indicating a need for better education and awareness.",

In the field of bone regeneration, MSCs have largely been considered for their osteogenic differentiation capacity. MSCs are increasingly being appreciated for their immunomodulatory potential following exposure to pro-inflammatory stimuli (licensing). Pro-inflammatory environments arise following bone injury via activation of resident immune cells like macrophages. We describe the use of a mineralized collagen scaffold as a bone-mimetic in vitro model to study the influence of paracrine versus direct cell-to-cell contact of THP-1 macrophages on MSC osteogenic and immunomodulatory potential. Paracrine stimuli from macrophages enhance MSC osteogenic and immunomodulatory potential via upregulation of key transcriptomic markers as well as via soluble biomolecule production. Direct co-culture of MSCs and macrophages decreased immunomodulatory potential in MSCs, especially for licensed MSCs, but enhanced matrix remodeling and expression of genes related to macrophage chemotaxis. These data demonstrate the significant effect macrophage-derived paracrine factors and direct contact have on MSC activity in a biomaterial model of bone regeneration.

        "AbstractText": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) stands as a powerful approach in weakly supervised learning, regularly employed in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification for detecting tumorous lesions. However, existing mainstream MIL methods focus on modeling correlation between instances while overlooking the inherent diversity among instances. However, few MIL methods have aimed at diversity modeling, which empirically show inferior performance but with a high computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel MIL aggregation method based on diverse global representation (DGR-MIL), by modeling diversity among instances through a set of global vectors that serve as a summary of all instances. First, we turn the instance correlation into the similarity between instance embeddings and the predefined global vectors through a cross-attention mechanism. This stems from the fact that similar instance embeddings typically would result in a higher correlation with a certain global vector. Second, we propose two mechanisms to enforce the diversity among the global vectors to be more descriptive of the entire bag: (i) positive instance alignment and (ii) a novel, efficient, and theoretically guaranteed diversification learning paradigm. Specifically, the positive instance alignment module encourages the global vectors to align with the center of positive instances (e.g., instances containing tumors in WSI). To further diversify the global representations, we propose a novel diversification learning paradigm leveraging the determinantal point process. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL aggregation models by a substantial margin on the CAMELYON-16 and the TCGA-lung cancer datasets.

MedGraphNet initializes nodes using informative embeddings from existing text knowledge, allowing for robust integration of various data types and improved generalizability. Our results demonstrate that MedGraphNet matches and often outperforms traditional single-relation approaches, particularly in scenarios with isolated or sparsely connected nodes.

Notably, MedGraphNet accurately inferred drug side effects without direct training on such data. Using Alzheimer's disease as a case study, MedGraphNet successfully identified relevant phenotypes, genes, and drugs, corroborated by existing literature.

        "AbstractText": "Esophageal cancer surgery is a complex procedure with significant challenges and high morbidity. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of patients undergoing three-port minimally invasive transthoracic esophagectomy with comprehensive mediastinal lymphadenectomy (3P-MIE) in the prone position, focusing on surgical technique, morbidity, mortality, histological findings, and survival outcomes. Data from 176 patients who underwent 3P-MIE for resectable esophageal cancer in the prone position from January 2010 to March 2023 were analyzed. Most patients underwent a two-field lymphadenectomy (n\u2009=\u2009173), while three patients had three-field nodal dissection. Thoracic component was performed thoracoscopically, while abdominal component through laparoscopy or mini laparotomy. Cervical esophagogastric anastomosis was performed in all patients using a semi-mechanical technique. The demographic data showed a median age of 52\u00a0years (range 21-73), with 99 females and 77 males. The predominant histology was squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (86%). Twenty-seven patients underwent upfront surgery (15%), neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NACRT) was delivered to 135 cases (77%), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in 11 (7%), and salvage surgery in 3 (2%). Surgical details revealed a median operative time of 370\u00a0min (range 90-580) and a median blood loss of 175\u00a0mL (range 50-2000\u00a0mL). Forty-nine percent (n\u2009=\u200987) of the patients experienced complications of grade 2 or greater according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Anastomotic leaks occurred in 14.7% of cases, and pneumonia in 17.6%. The median ICU stay was 4\u00a0days (range 2-22), and\u00a0median hospital stay of 9\u00a0days (range 5-38). Thirty-day mortality was observed in 5% (n\u2009=\u20099), and 90-day mortality in 6.25% (n\u2009=\u200911). A median of 20 nodes were retrieved, with R0 resection achieved in 96.6% of cases. With a median follow-up of 60\u00a0months, the median overall survival (OS) was 62.5%, and the median disease-free survival (DFS) was not reached. Three-port minimally invasive transthoracic esophagectomy in the prone position is a feasible and safe approach, achieving good mediastinal clearance and high R0 resection rates.",

The reported risk of malignancy (ROM) and those from high-volume institutes may not be identical. The cost of molecular testing and its unavailability for routine use limits its utility in decision-making. In this study, we included all patients diagnosed at our institute with Bethesda 3 and 4 thyroid nodules on FNAC between January 2012 and December 2021. We identified the risk of malignancy for these patients along with other factors that could help identify the possibility of malignancy in these thyroid nodules. We utilised the clinical (C), ultrasound features (U), and the Bethesda category (T) to derive the CUT score and derive a cut-off value beyond which malignancy could be predicted. A total of 359 patients were included in the study. The ROM for the Bethesda 3 thyroid nodule was 77.7% (167/215), and that for the Bethesda 4 thyroid nodule was 76.4% (110/144). On multivariate analysis, nodules taller than wider [0.006, 7.662 (1.806-32.5)], male gender [0.024, 2.359 (1.119-4.976)], and the presence of microcalcification [0.004, 2.328 (1.319-4.109)] were found to be significant for the presence of malignancy in the final histopathology. The CUT score\u2009>\u20098.875 was associated with malignancy in the final histopathology. Various clinical and radiological factors may be useful to identify the nodules harbouring malignancy and facilitate appropriate management.

We sought to estimate the ability of this metric to predict major postoperative complications in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing the Whipple procedure. This is a prospective, observational, single-centre study involving adult patients undergoing the Whipple procedure, at a major tertiary cancer centre. All eligible patients undergoing Whipple surgery in our institute between March 2018 and October 2021 were included in the study. Demographic data, clinicopathological characteristics, comorbidities, intraoperative variables, and postoperative complications were analyzed. The surgical score was calculated from intraoperative blood loss, lowest heart rate, and lowest mean arterial pressure. All the patients were followed up till 30\u00a0days postoperatively. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate analyses were used as appropriate. The occurrence of major postoperative complications represented the primary outcome. A total of 253 patients were analyzed. The mean duration of surgery was 436\u00a0min. On statistical analyses, the occurrence of major postoperative complications was significantly associated with SAS\u2009\u2264\u20094 (OR\u2009=\u20098.00, 95% CI\u2009=\u20093.78-16.93, p\u2009=\u20090.000), use of intraoperative vasopressor (OR\u2009=\u20092.247, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.312-3.846, p\u2009=\u20090.003), and body mass index (BMI) (OR\u2009=\u20091.074, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.010-1.142, p\u2009=\u20090.022). However, we did not find any significant association between other demographic variables like age, comorbidities, duration of surgery, and preoperative s. albumin with the occurrence of postoperative complications. Lower SAS (\u2264\u20094) is the most powerful predictor of postoperative complications in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing Whipple surgery.

Retrospective observational single institution-based study comprising 19 patients who underwent robotic thyroid surgery for DTC between October 2018 and January 2022. All patients underwent robotic thyroidectomy using the da Vinci Xi Robotic surgical system. Nineteen patients underwent robotic thyroidectomy with none needing conversion to open surgery. The Modified BABA approach was used for 9 patients (47%), whereas the Retroauricular approach (RA) was used for 10 patients (53%). In the RA group, 6 patients (60%) underwent total thyroidectomy and 4 patients (40%) underwent hemithyroidectomy. The Modified BABA approach was used for total thyroidectomy in 8 (89%) patients whereas 1 patient (11%) underwent hemithyroidectomy utilizing this approach. In 10 patients, central compartment clearance was done (5 through Modified BABA and 5 through RA). Lateral neck nodes were addressed in 4 patients (1 through Modified BABA and 3via RA). The median hospital stay was 4\u00a0days (range: 2-6\u00a0days). None of the 19 patients had post-operative complications like RLN palsy or any scar-related complaints /hypertrophic scars. The average PTH value post-op was 32.1\u00a0pg/ml (range: 3.8-70.4\u00a0pg/ml). Based on the current evidence from the literature, robotic thyroidectomy for thyroid carcinoma stands out from conventional surgery by resulting in sound oncological clearance with a superior cosmetic result by avoiding a scar in the anterior neck.",

But, in the Eastern population, the tumor often originates in the antropyloric region resulting in comparatively early occurrence of GOO. The management of such resectable cases is not clearly defined in literature.\u00a0In this study, we analyzed the surgical outcome and survival of upfront D2 gastrectomy combined with adjuvant chemotherapy in these cases. METHODS: This study enrolled consecutive patients with carcinoma stomach accompanied by GOO from April 2018 to March 2022. The feasibility of radical surgery, clinicopathological profile, and factors affecting postoperative morbidity were analyzed. Two-year overall survival (OS) and associated factors were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Among 119 gastric carcinoma patients, 78 presented with GOO. After excluding metastatic disease (18), locally unresectable disease (5), and neo-adjuvant therapy (3), 52 patients underwent radical gastrectomy. Post-operative morbidity and 90-day mortality were 32.7% and 0%, respectively. Factors affecting morbidity were low hemoglobin levels (p\u2009=\u20090.024) and type of procedure (subtotal vs. total gastrectomy) (p\u2009=\u20090.04). A total of 78.8% patients completed fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The 2-year OS was 59.3% and non-completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 2.68, p\u2009=\u20090.038) and poor tumor differentiation (HR 2.77, p\u2009=\u20090.015) were linked to worse OS. CONCLUSION: Upfront radical surgery in resectable carcinoma stomach with GOO is a feasible treatment option with acceptable good surgical and oncological outcomes. With combined adjuvant chemotherapy, a reasonable survival rate is observed.",

The efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) versus traditional treatment approaches, including surgery, remains a critical area of investigation to improve patient outcomes. This retrospective observational study analyzed 84 patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma (stage IIIC or IV) treated at tertiary care center, Tamil Nadu. It compared survival outcomes between patients receiving NACT alone and those undergoing NACT followed by surgical intervention. Data on demographic characteristics, tumor size, ECOG performance status, menopausal status, ascites fluid cytology, and comorbidities were collected. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were used for statistical assessment. The study found significant associations between treatment modality and survival outcomes. Tumor size, particularly T3, positive ascitic fluid cytology, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly influenced recurrence risk. The overall survival time had a median of 9\u00a0years, and time to recurrence had a median of 8\u00a0years. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, when combined with surgical intervention, demonstrated a potential improvement in survival outcomes. The integration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with surgical intervention may offer beneficial outcomes for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. This study underscores the importance of tailored treatment approaches, emphasizing the role of NACT in the therapeutic landscape of ovarian cancer.",

Retrospective analysis of gastric cancer patients who underwent curative resection was done on a prospectively maintained computerized database from 2000 to 2021 in Dr. BRAIRCH, AIIMS, New Delhi. After a median follow-up of 50\u00a0months, 101 recurrences (50.75%) were detected among 199 curative resections. Recurrences were categorized into nonperitoneal distant (40.6%), peritoneal (28.7%), locoregional (22.8%), and mixed type (7.9%). For all the subsites most common type of recurrence was distant recurrence (Distal stomach- 38%, proximal stomach-55%, and body-41%). Most common site of recurrence was liver (32.7%), followed by peritoneum (28.7%), locoregional node (15.8%), mixed type (7.9%), anastomotic site (6.9%), lung (5.9%), and bone (2.0%). No statistically significant difference was noted among different subsites (p\u2009=\u20090.566), and specific site (p\u2009=\u20090.649). Weight loss, lymphovascular invasion, pathological stage, and pathological T stage, and node ratio are significant predictors of recurrence. Median disease-free survival was 29\u00a0months (95% CI-24.455-33.545). Median overall survival for peritoneal recurrence was 34\u00a0months (95%CI-31.48-36.52), distant site 38\u00a0months (95%CI-26.789-49.211), locoregional 51\u00a0months (95%CI-41.609-60.319), and mixed type 56\u00a0months (95%CI-47.684-64.316).

Literature says that the submandibular salivary gland (SMG) can be involved by direct extension from the primary tumour (<\u20095%) or through metastatic node in level Ib (0.5-1.5%). Retrospective studies have shown that the SMG can be preserved in OCSCC except in those where the primary tumour or level 1b nodes are in close vicinity to the gland. The goal of our prospective observational study was to evaluate the involvement of SMG in OCSCC. We had enrolled a total of 142 patients from July 2018 to May 2020 fulfilling the selection criteria and planned for appropriate surgery with removal of the SMG. The postoperative histopathology report was then assessed to look for the involvement of SMG. We observed majority patients in their 4th-5th decade with mean age of 49\u00a0years. Majority of the primary tumor were staged as pT2-T3. Out of 142 patients, 76 (53.52%) were node-negative (pN0) and 66 (46.48%) were node-positive (pN\u2009+). Level Ib lymph node involvement was seen in 65.15% of the pN\u2009+\u2009cases. We did not find SMG involvement in any of the cases either from direct extension of primary tumor or from level Ib lymph node extranodal spread. We conclude that SMG involvement is extremely rare in OCSCC. It is better to preserve the gland for which a prospective study is warranted to assess the functional benefits of preserving the gland.",

While a number of pharmacological treatments are used to reduce tobacco use, they often have adverse effects. Fewer studies have assessed non-pharmacological treatments {Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or fish oil} to reduce tobacco use. Omega-3 fatty acids, already known for their benefits in reducing bad cholesterol, managing diabetes, and helping with fatty liver, are now being studied for their potential impact on smoking habits. We aimed to evaluate the effect of omega-3 supplementation (flaxseed oil as a vegetarian source of alpha-linolenic acid, ALA) on tobacco craving intensity, withdrawal symptoms, and various biochemical markers in tobacco users. This single-blind, placebo-controlled study involved 104 tobacco users divided into two groups: omega-3 (n\u2009=\u200954) receiving 10\u00a0ml flaxseed oil daily for 6\u00a0months and placebo (n\u2009=\u200950). We measured tobacco craving intensity {Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)}, withdrawal symptoms {Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS)}, demographic parameters (BMI, WHR, BP, HR), and biochemical parameters (LFT, KFT, Lipid Profile) at baseline and after 6\u00a0months. Six-month consumption of edible grade pure flaxseed oil resulted in significant lowering of BMI in omega-3 group when compared to placebo group (p\u2009=\u20090.0002). Also, omega-3 effectively decreased tobacco craving intensity (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and its withdrawal (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). More intriguingly, LFT panel showed significantly lower levels of bilirubin (D) (p\u2009=\u20090.0216) and SGPT (p\u2009=\u20090.0217). Urea level (p\u2009=\u20090.0489) was significantly decreased while creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were comparatively decreased in omega-3 than placebo group in KFT panel. Eventually in case of lipid profile, triglycerides (p\u2009=\u20090.0031), LDL (p\u2009=\u20090.0291) and VLDL (p\u2009=\u20090.0055) showed significant reduction in omega-3 group.

The probable contribution of SLC25A32 toward facilitating the proliferation of cancerous cells remains inadequately explored. This pilot study aims to survey the expression of SLC25A32 in non-metastatic colorectal tissues and its potential association with clinicopathological characteristics. Fresh tissue samples were collected from 30 colorectal cancer patients and their adjacent normal tissues. Total RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized for qRT-PCR. In silico analysis was also performed to further investigate the functional significance of SLC25A32 in colorectal cancer by examining its expression in normal tissues, identifying protein interactions, and searching for pathogenic mutations. Our results revealed a significant up-regulation of SLC25A32 expression in tumorous tissues compared to non-tumorous tissues. The elevated expression of SLC25A32 was associated with tumor anatomic site and size. In silico analysis revealed that higher levels of SLC25A32 expression were correlated with reduced overall survival rates. Furthermore, enrichment analysis showed that this gene remarkably enriched in the process of Folate metabolism. The involvement of SLC25A32 in tumorigenesis may be due to its regulation of mitochondrial folate and FAD metabolism, which have been linked to cancer progression. Changes in SLC25A32 expression or function may contribute to cancer development, making it a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",

The AGO1*rs595961 genetic variant was correlated with an elevated risk of bladder carcinoma, whereas the AGO2*rs4961280 variant was not. Further research is warranted to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms and potential clinical implications.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Glass-blowing, brass-playing, and other laryngocele etiologies: Fact or fiction? A systematic literature review.",
        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Laryngocele is a rare condition, which can be congenital or acquired, characterized by an abnormal dilatation of the laryngeal ventricle filled with air. A correlation between laryngocele formation and increased intralaryngeal pressure has been postulated, as much as a frequent coexistence with laryngeal carcinoma. Despite this, systematic research on its potential etiology is still limited up to date. METHODS: We carried out a systematic an electronic search on the MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for all articles related to laryngocele or laryngopyocele. The authors performed a PRISMA-compliant systematic review across multiple databases including all studies published until February 7, 2023, focusing on laryngocele etiology. Case reports and articles in languages other than English were excluded. The authors recorded etiology, age of patients, male-to-female ratio, history of smoking, symptoms, management, and overall follow-up. RESULTS: The majority of publications related to laryngocele are case reports and case series. We found a total of 10 articles correctly reporting etiologies, the majority of which included only a limited number of patients. Most case series explored the association of laryngocele and laryngeal cancer. Other reported etiologies were wind instruments' playing, cricohyoidoepiglottopexy's execution, amyloidosis, and chronic constipation. Some cases of congenital laryngocele were also reported. CONCLUSIONS: Actual knowledge concerning laryngocele etiology appears-based on literature studies-inferential at best. The association between laryngocele and laryngeal cancer is, on the other hand, well-established and must be taken into account when evaluating patients with this condition. Wider and prospective data collections should allow further insight into this condition and its pathogenesis.",

METHODS: The 2004-2016 National Cancer Database was queried for patients with PA receiving definitive treatment. Tumor size represented the largest diameter of the primary tumor. RESULTS: A total of 89,863 patients (53.8% female) with a mean age and tumor size of (51.0\u2009\u00b1\u200918.0) years (Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, later the same) and (19.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.2) mm, respectively, were included. Patients were managed at 1,241 unique facilities, categorized into 1057 low-volume (treating approximately <10 patients annually), 142 intermediate-volume (treating approximately 10-30 patients annually), and 42 high-volume facilities (treating approximately 31-105 patients annually). Increasing facility volume and academic centers were both associated with higher rates of surgical treatment as well as lower rates of radiotherapy and shorter postoperative length of hospitalization (all p\u2009<\u20090.001). Kaplan-Meier log-rank analysis showed that increasing facility volume and academic centers were both significantly associated with improved overall survival (p\u2009<\u20090.001). On multivariate Cox-regression analysis after adjusting for age, gender, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index, tumor size, treatment type, and facility type, treatment at intermediate-volume (HR 1.238, 95% CI 1.155-1.329, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and low-volume facilities (HR\u2009=\u20091.413, 95% CI 1.306-1.528, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were independent risk factors of all-cause mortality, while facility type was not independently associated with overall survival. CONCLUSION: Management and outcomes of PA appear to be dependent on the treatment facility volume, with high-volume facilities, but not necessarily facility type, being associated with improved outcomes overall.",

We describe risk factors for and outcomes of PMI in patients undergoing tracheotomy. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients undergoing tracheotomy from 2007 to 2016. PMI was defined by a postoperative cardiac troponin I (cTnI)\u2009>\u200999th percentile. Demographics and comorbidities were extracted from the electronic medical record and compared between patients with and without PMI. Significant univariate predictors were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to determine independent predictors of PMI. Thirty-day and 1-year mortality of patients with and without PMI were compared. RESULTS: Of 861 patients undergoing tracheotomy, 41 (4.76%) had PMI and 820 (95.24%) did not. PMI was associated with higher mortality at both 30 days (40.5% vs. 11.2%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 1 year (73.2% vs. 44.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients with PMI were older (median age 65 vs. 60, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and more likely to have prior myocardial infarction (MI) (36.6% vs. 10.7%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and chronic kidney disease (31.7% vs. 16.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.024). Cancer diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of PMI (24.4% vs. 41.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.041). Older age (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20091.033, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and prior MI (OR\u2009=\u20093.686, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were independently associated with PMI. CONCLUSION: Patients with PMI following tracheotomy had increased short- and long-term mortality. Increased age and history of prior MI were independent predictors of PMI, while cancer was associated with a lower risk of PMI following tracheotomy. ICU patients likely have more acute ailments contributing to a higher risk of PMI and poorer outcomes compared to cancer patients requiring tracheotomy. We propose routine screening for PMI with cTnI in the postoperative period in all tracheotomy patients.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the robustness of the NSQIP database to characterize morbidity and complications associated with LD usage concurrent to minimally invasive resection of pituitary tumors. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to query patients undergoing transnasal resection of pituitary tumor. Patients were stratified by concurrent perioperative use of LD and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: A total of 1714 patients underwent minimally invasive endonasal (microscopic or endoscopic) pituitary tumor resection, of which LD was concurrently placed in 98 (5.7%) cases. Operative time was significantly longer for patients who had LD placed compared to those without (176.5\u2009min (IQR 114.8-229.5) vs. 137\u2009min [IQR 100-185]), (p\u2009<\u20090.001) with a significantly longer length of stay (5 days [IQR 4-6] vs. 3 days [IQR 2-5]), (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate regression demonstrated LD placement was an independent predictor of postoperative medical complication (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.15-5.03, p\u2009=\u20090.020) and unplanned readmission (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.02-4.16, p\u2009=\u20090.044), but not CSF leak (OR 2.30, 95% CI 0.51-10.26; p\u2009=\u20090.276). Temporal analysis during the study period demonstrated a decrease in LD use from 8% to 5% (R 2\u2009=\u20090.60; p\u2009=\u20090.025). CONCLUSIONS: The NSQIP database provides a large patient population for examining LD use in endoscopic pituitary adenoma resection. LD use for minimally invasive pituitary surgery is associated with postoperative medical complications and unplanned readmissions, with no apparent impact on reconstructive outcomes, and there is overall decreasing usage.

The APC models were estimated by Poisson regression through estimable functions in women aged 30 and over residing in the states of the South and Northeast regions. Upon estimating the APC models, a positive gradient was found in mortality rates with advancing age in all locations The South region showed a reduction in the risk of death in the last two periods (RR2010-2014 0.94; RR2015-2019 0.90, p<0.001) and a reduction in risk in the cohorts from 1900 to 1929 (RR1900-04 0.55, RR1925-1929 0.89, p<0.001); a similar profile was observed in all states. In the Northeast, there was a progressive increase in the risk of death in the last periods, ranging from 1.02 to 1.11 (2010-2014 vs. 2015-2019, p<0.001).

It has drawn the attention of major public health agencies as they work intensely towards understanding the behavior of the virus causing the disease, while simultaneously establishing ways to curb the spread of the virus among populations. As of the time of writing, 7,949,973 confirmed cases have been reported globally; with the United States (US) contributing to 26.4% (2,096,902 of 7,949,973) of case infections. Additionally, 434,181 deaths have been reported with the US contributing to 26.7% (115,755 of 434,181) of case fatalities. At least 21.0% of these cases in the US belong to the Black Non-Hispanic ethnic group, resulting in an added burden to the many existing health disparities facing this Black population. Tuskegee University, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in the Deep South, has a majority Black Non-Hispanic population that is disproportionally susceptible to contracting COVID-19. By conducting an overall evaluation of those initial and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response actions implemented by the HBCU, our study investigations support the basis for understanding and assessing the impact of implementing effective public health measures at a minority serving institution. The evaluation exercise has captured a unique framework model that can be used for analyzing direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic to the HBCUs. The framework has allowed for the identification of integrative and modular interactions among stakeholders, mechanisms and actions implemented by the university's leadership through appointed committees such as the Community Health Task Force (CHTF). The designed systematic framework was used to understand how the mitigating response actions taken by the HBCU contributed to keeping the institution's 'community family' as safe as possible through the existing pandemic. The framework model is a potentially effective tool that can be used to enhance the Institutional Infectious Disease Response Plan, and to develop policies necessary to manage outbreaks of a similar nature. Investigations also suggest that through the implementation of public health best practices and recommendations in accordance with those released by public health agencies, the burden of the pandemic can be reduced and community spread of COVID-19 prevented, when HBCUs strategically manage the interactions among its resources on campus.",

However, navigating tortuous lung anatomy to the distal branches of the bronchoalveolar tree for adequate sampling using BAL remains challenging. Continuum robots have been used to improve the navigation of guidewires, catheters, and endoscopes and could be applied to the BAL procedure as well. One class of continuum robots is constructed from a notched tube and actuated using a tendon. Many tendon-driven notched continuum robots use uniform machining parameters to achieve approximately constant-curvature configurations, which may be unsuitable for traversing the tortuous anatomy of the lungs. This paper presents a model that predicts the curvature of a robot with arbitrary notch shapes subjected to tendon tension. The model predicted the deflection of rectangular, elliptical, and sinusoidal notches in a 0.89 mm diameter nitinol tube with 2.32%, 3.65%, and 6.32% error, respectively. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed to determine the optimal pattern of notches to achieve a desired nonuniform robot curvature. A simulated robot designed using the algorithm achieved the desired shape with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.52\u00b0. Additionally, we present a model for predicting the shape of nonuniformly notched continuum robots which incorporates friction and pre-curvature. This model predicted the shape of a continuum robot with nonuniform rectangular notches with an average RMSE of 5.20\u00b0 with respect to the actual robot.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Nutritional intake during childhood can shape health and well-being throughout life. Although excess macronutrient intake is considered the main driver of obesity development, micronutrients, i.e., minerals and vitamins, can potentiate or ameliorate pathological processes of adiposity. Hence, the micronutrient intake relationship to childhood obesity can guide precision approaches to nutritional needs, considering the dietary habits of a population. Childhood obesity is a health disparity throughout the United States-Affiliated Pacific (USAP) region. OBJECTIVES: The study examined the association between micronutrient intake with body mass index (BMI in kg/m2) and the presence of insulin resistance proxy, acanthosis nigricans (AN), in 3529 children aged 2-8 y from the USAP region in the Children's Healthy Living study. METHODS: The association of micronutrient intakes with BMI and the presence of AN was stratified by World Bank income groups. Main food sources for micronutrients were also identified from 2 d of food records. Obesity and AN were measured by standardized staff. RESULTS: Most USAP children did not meet daily intake recommendations for micronutrients, with low intake of calcium, potassium, vitamin D, vitamin E, excess sodium, vitamin A, folate, and niacin. Obesity was directly associated with thiamin intake and inversely associated with selenium intake. AN was inversely associated with calcium, copper, iron, phosphorus, potassium, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin D, and vitamin E intakes and directly associated with selenium and pantothenic acid intake. Micronutrient intake imbalances were most associated with insulin resistance and obesity in lower-middle and high-income groups in the USAP region, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The profile of micronutrient intake in USAP children and its association with obesity and insulin resistance can be used to provide precision nutrition policy guidance according to the World Bank income group to improve micronutrient intake and curb childhood obesity.",

METHODS: In the study, 100 patients who have been treated in the urology departments because of benign hyperplasia or prostate cancer participated. The Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15), and International Prostate Symptom Scale (IPSS) were used in the research. RESULTS: The respondents weakly accepted their illness (26.9 points). The intensity of symptoms accompanying prostate diseases was moderate (18.8 points), and they were mainly characterized by moderate disorders in the IIEF-15 scale (erectile function - 9.3 pts, orgasmic function - 2.9 pts, sexual desire - 5.1 pts, intercourse satisfaction - 3.7 pts, overall satisfaction - 4.4 pts).

Recent experiments, coupled with data-driven methods to extract a cell's equation of motion, showed that cancerous MDA-MB-231 cells persistently hop in a limit cycle when placed on two-state adhesive micropatterns (two large squares connected by a narrow bridge), while they remain stationary on average in rectangular confinements. In contrast, healthy MCF10A cells migrating on the two-state micropattern are bistable, i.e., they settle into either basin on average with only noise-induced hops between the two states. We can capture all these behaviors with a single computational phase field model of a crawling cell, under the assumption that contact with nonadhesive substrate inhibits the cell front. Our model predicts that larger and softer cells are more likely to persistently hop, while smaller and stiffer cells are more likely to be bistable. Other key factors controlling cell migration are the frequency of protrusions and their magnitude of noise. Our results show that relatively simple assumptions about how cells sense their geometry can explain a wide variety of different cell behaviors, and show the power of data-driven approaches to characterize both experiment and simulation.",

Additionally, there is a need to identify and isolate cells of interest at the early stages of cell expansion. To address this challenge, we engineered a nucleic acid-based gold nanorod (NAGNR) fluorescent biosensor that can detect the mRNA expression of intracellular markers for cell sorting. We demonstrated its application in isolating induced neuronal (iN) cells from dermal fibroblast populations during the early stages of cell reprogramming. Cell sorting based on the mRNA of the neuronal transcriptional factor Ascl1 resulted in an enrichment of iN cells from 3% to 72%, and additional sorting with the transcriptional factor Scn2 further increased iN enrichment. Moreover, NAGNR biosensors can be used in conjunction with protein marker-based cell sorting. NAGNR-sorted iN cells show a functional response to electrical stimulation in a co-culture of iN cells and muscle cells. These findings demonstrate that NAGNR-based cell sorting offers great potential for cell identification and isolation at an early stage of cell reprogramming and manufacturing.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with recurrent and metastatic sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) and evaluate the current treatment strategies to help guide future management. DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was conducted at six international tertiary treatment centers. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with documented diagnoses of recurrent or metastatic SNUC since 1983 were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were collected. Primary outcome measures included disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS), and time to recurrence (TTR) following initial treatment. Further univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess for prognostic factors. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 52.4 (15.6) were identified, 15 of whom presented with metastatic SNUC and 90 of whom developed recurrence. Management in both populations was widely variable. For patients with metastatic disease, the 1-year DSS probability was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.8-100%). For patients with recurrent SNUC, the 1- and 5-year DSS probabilities were 45.7% (95% CI, 31.9-65.6%) and 8.6% (95% CI, 2.9-25.3%), respectively. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) TTR was 8 months (3-18.5 months). Multivariable analyses revealed a significant association between orbital involvement on initial presentation and TTR (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20093.28; 95% CI, 1.45-7.42; p \u2009=\u20090.004). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing metastatic and recurrent SNUC based on a large patient cohort. Orbital extension of the primary SNUC may predict a higher probability of recurrence following treatment, suggesting the possible utility of a more aggressive treatment in this subgroup of patients. A heterogenous patient population and wide variability in management emphasize the challenges in standardizing care; however, dismal survival rates demonstrate the necessity for further evaluation of current approaches to improve evidence-based recommendations.",

The primary goal of this Monte Carlo (MC) study was to investigate the feasibility of upgrading an existing experimental benchtop XRF/XFCT imaging setup adopting a single silicon drift detector (SDD), developed based on the aforementioned concept (often known as L-shell XFCT), by deploying another SDD within the same setup. Specifically, an MC model of the original single SDD L-shell XFCT setup, along with a filtered 62 kVp polychromatic x-ray beam, was developed using the Geant4 MC toolkit, and added with a second SDD at an equidistance of 11 cm from the isocenter on the opposite side. Besides the aforementioned feasibility study, this MC model was used to investigate other parameters that may affect the system performance but cannot be easily tested experimentally (e.g., use of monoenergetic photon beams). Upon completion of MC studies, a new commercial SDD was experimentally characterized for optimal performance and deployed to an existing single SDD L-shell XFCT setup. The MC results demonstrated the feasibility of highly sensitive detection of gold L-shell XRF photons and XRF/XFCT imaging of GNP-containing phantoms using the modeled dual SDD setup. According to the MC results, the GNP detection limit achievable from the dual SDD setup can be in the range of 5 to 10 ppm with a filtered 62 kVp beam and slightly improved (down to ~5 ppm) with the monoenergetic x-ray beams (15 and 20 keV). The experimental results showed the new SDD performed optimally under the current experimental conditions at the manufacturer suggested bias voltage (-135 V). The experimentally measured detection limit from both old and new SDDs was 10 ppm, consistent with the MC results. In addition to the results summarized above, some additional benefits/characteristics from a dual SDD setup (e.g., 2-fold reduction in the sample scan time at a given dose or 2-fold improvement in the image resolution at a given scan time) are immediately discernable.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer remains one of the most challenging diseases to treat in the medical field. Machine learning (ML) has enabled in-depth analysis of complex patterns from large, diverse datasets, greatly facilitating \"healthcare automation\" in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Despite these advancements, ML models face challenges stemming from limited labeled sample sizes, the intricate interplay of high-dimensionality data types, the inherent heterogeneity observed among patients and within tumors, and concerns about interpretability and consistency with existing biomedical knowledge. One approach to address these challenges is to integrate biomedical knowledge into data-driven models, which has proven potential to improve the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of model results. Here, we review the state-of-the-art ML studies that leverage the fusion of biomedical knowledge and data, termed knowledge-informed machine learning (KIML), to advance cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We provide an overview of diverse forms of knowledge representation and current strategies of knowledge integration into machine learning pipelines with concrete examples. We conclude the review article by discussing future directions aimed at leveraging KIML to advance cancer research and healthcare automation.

Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are among the most widely used imaging modalities, often requiring the isotopic labelling of bioactive molecules to generate the desired imaging probes. Unfortunately, radiochemistry often limits the development of novel agents due to complicated syntheses and the incompatibility of complex molecules. Here, considering the prevalence of carboxylic acids in drug and bioactive molecules, we have developed a method to perform 11/13C labelling through carboxylic acid groups via organic photoredox reactions to generate radiolabelled nitriles. We applied this strategy to a range of aliphatic carboxylic acids, including complex and functionalized drug molecules, amino acids and short peptides. Notably, when benzylic and alkyl carboxylic acids were used as substrates, a copper co-catalyst was required to obtain the labelled nitriles, whereas when \u03b1-amino acids and peptides were used as substrates, a copper co-catalyst was not required to form labelled \u03b1-amino nitriles. The radiolabelled nitrile products could be easily converted back to radiolabelled carboxylic acids with high radiochemical yields and molar activities.",

However, more research is needed to the impact of each treatment on kidney function decline. OBJECTIVE: To compare the progression of kidney function decline in patients with cT1a SRM treated with MWA or PN. METHODS: This study included prospective data on patients treated between 2015-2021 with kidney function data collected from 2015-2024 from a single institutional database. Three outcomes for kidney function decline were examined: 30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) compared to pre-treatment, chronic kidney disease (CKD) upstaging compared to pre-treatment and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, and the composite endpoint of the previous two events. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare outcomes between the two treatments. RESULTS: Among 97 MWA and 49 PN included, MWA patients were older, had lower baseline eGFR, and higher rates of CKD prior to treatment. Univariate Cox proportional hazard model showed treatment modality was not significantly associated with reaching kidney decline endpoints. After adjusting for patient characteristics (age, race, baseline eGFR, Charlson Comorbidity Index), only baseline eGFR was associated with reaching kidney function endpoints. CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference in kidney function decline between PN and MWA treatments for cT1a SRM. After adjusting for patient factors, the higher hazard for MWA was attenuated.",

Here we report homogeneous nanocrystals with tunable bandgaps in the infrared spectrum based on HgSe and HgxCd1-xSe alloys deriving from CdSe precursors. We find that Ag+ catalyses cation interdiffusion to reduce the CdSe-HgSe alloying temperature from 250 \u00b0C to 80 \u00b0C. Together with ligands that modulate surface cation exchange rates, interdiffusion-enhanced Hg2+ exchange of diverse CdSe nanocrystals proceeds homogeneously and completely. The products retain the size, shape and uniformity of the parent nanocrystals but exhibit enhanced absorption. After passivation with heteroepitaxial CdZnS shells, photoluminescence wavelengths are tunable in the shortwave infrared by composition without changing size, with 80-91% quantum yield and linewidths near 100 meV. These materials may find applications in infrared photonic devices and infrared bioimaging.",

Immunotherapies targeting T cell responses against metastatic tumors depend on the presence of specific T cell phenotypes, which dynamically evolve with disease progression and treatment. Herein, we investigate T cell phenotype dynamics throughout metastatic disease progression, focusing on both the metastatic site in the lung and a biomaterial implant that serves as a synthetic metastatic niche, with the latter providing an accessible, non-vital tissue for longitudinal analysis. Regulatory T cells were reduced at the lung and scaffold implant sites of metastasis following disease onset and progression relative to healthy mice, while Th1 and Th17 populations remained relatively stable. CD8+ T cells transitioned from na\u00efve and central memory to effector memory with disease progression. Additionally, functional analyses involving the metastatic tissues suggested the primary T cell suppressive mechanisms was reduced migration, with no impact on T cell activation. Blood-based analyses demonstrated some of these phenotypic dynamics yet does not recapitulate the functional assays. Collectively, the scaffold provides a platform for dynamically monitoring T cell phenotypes and functions similar to the metastatic lung, enabling longitudinal monitoring of disease progression that could stratify patient populations.",

However, few studies investigate how participants with chronic pain interpret the word 'craving' and how interpretations impact survey responses. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study among 12 individuals with chronic pain who were using prescription opioids and cannabis. Participants completed baseline surveys, cognitive interviews, and 14-day smartphone-based EMA data collection. Analyses included deductive and inductive coding of interviews and t-tests of EMA self-reports of opioid and cannabis craving. RESULTS: Four participants had negative reactions to the word 'craving', including mentions that these questions offended them. The remaining eight participants mentioned no negative connotation. EMA data showed that participants without negative reactions reported a greater range (opioids), higher standard deviation (opioids), and higher maximum (opioids, cannabis) on Likert-type EMA craving items, compared to those with a negative reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Some individuals with chronic pain may have a negative reaction to the word 'craving' related to opioid and cannabis use and this reaction may impact survey responses.

It exhibits unique clinical and pathological features, demonstrates high aggressiveness, and has a relatively poor prognosis and clinical outcome. OBJECTIVE: To identify a novel drug target protein against TNBC and potential phytochemical lead molecules against the identified target. METHODS: In this study, we retrieved TNBC samples from NGS and microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We employed a combination of differential gene expression studies, protein-protein interaction analysis, and network topology investigation to identify the target protein. Additionally, the molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies followed by Molecular Mechanics with Generalised Born Surface Area salvation was used to identify potential lead molecule. RESULT: The upregulated genes with LogFC > 1.25 and P-value < 0.05 from the TNBC gene expression dataset were identified. Androgen receptor (AR) was found to be an appropriate hub target in the protein-protein interaction network. Phytochemicals that inhibit breast cancer target were retrieved from the PubChem database and virtual screening was performed using PyRx against the AR protein. Thereby, the AR was found to be the target protein and 2-hydroxynaringenin was discovered to be a possible phytochemical lead molecule for combating TNBC. Moreover, the AR and the 2-hydroxynaringenin complex showed structural stability and higher binding affinity through molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA studies. CONCLUSION: AR was identified as a hub protein that is highly expressed in breast cancer and 2-hydroxynaringenin efficacy of counter TNBC requires further investigation both in vitro and in vivo.",

However, PS estimation grapples with the theoretical and practical challenges posed by high-dimensional covariates. Motivated by an integrative analysis of breast cancer patients across seven medical centers, this paper tackles the challenges of integrating multiple observational datasets. The proposed inferential technique, called Bayesian Motif Submatrices for Covariates (B-MSC), addresses the curse of dimensionality by a hybrid of Bayesian and frequentist approaches. B-MSC uses nonparametric Bayesian \"Chinese restaurant\" processes to eliminate redundancy in the high-dimensional covariates and discover latent motifs or lower-dimensional structures. With these motifs as potential predictors, standard regression techniques can be utilized to accurately infer the PSs and facilitate covariate-balanced group comparisons. Simulations and meta-analysis of the motivating cancer investigation demonstrate the efficacy of the B-MSC approach to accurately estimate the propensity scores and efficiently address covariate imbalance when integrating observational health studies with high-dimensional covariates.",

Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is often linked with changes in the activity or expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a well-known tumor suppressor, and androgen receptor (AR), a pro-tumorigenic transcription factor. However, no therapies exist for the simultaneous correction of tumorigenic promotion and suppressor depletion. Here, we report that concurrent PTEN restoration and AR silencing by lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of PTEN messenger RNA (mPTEN) and AR small interfering RNA (siAR) elicited synergistic therapeutic effects in PCa cells. We screened various LNP formulations for the optimal delivery of both RNAs. In C4-2 and LNCaP cells, both of which are AR-positive and PTEN-null PCa cell lines, the combinatorial treatment of siAR and mPTEN LNPs resulted in much stronger cytotoxicity in vitro than the treatment of either alone. Western blot analyses revealed concurrent regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, leading to increased caspase-3 cleavage-mediated apoptosis. Our findings suggest that the strategy of RNA-mediated concurrent restoration of tumor suppressors and inhibition of tumorigenic drivers could lead to the more effective treatment of PCa and potentially other malignancies.",

Through a combination of quantitative experiments, artificial-intelligence-driven image processing, and mathematical modeling, we uncover rapid transitions in cell phenotypes and phenotype-dependent motility among disseminating cells originating from tumor spheroids. Persistent invasion leads to continuous remodeling of the extracellular matrix surrounding the spheroids, altering the landscape of migration phenotypes.

African American breast cancer survivors (BCS) show higher incidences of chronic conditions, like obesity, with barriers to body wellness. Lifestyle interventions can improve survivorship outcomes, but most have not been adapted to African American BCS needs. The purpose of this research is to explore and honor the lived experiences of breast cancer survivorship among African American women with obesity to better understand their experiences and perceptions of how their cancer journey intersects with other health behaviors and to identify barriers to health-promoting behaviors. A co-design approach with five participants was used to understand specific barriers to a healthy weight and lifestyle as well as potential solutions that would benefit African American or Black BCS entering an evidence-based lifestyle intervention that targeted weight and body wellness. Participants completed one co-design session for problem identification. This initial session identified the participants' most impactful cancer- and non-cancer-related barriers to building health behaviors. Cancer- and non-cancer-related barriers to a healthy lifestyle were identified from artifact creation and affinity diagramming for intensity and frequency. Top cancer-related barriers were pain and fatigue related to cancer treatment and its side effects. Non-cancer related barriers included time and responsibilities, lack of nutritional information and culturally, medically sensitive exercise resources, as well as restrictive definitions of health used by medical professionals. Both cancer-related and non-cancer-related barriers were identified as contributing to difficulty in maintaining health behaviors.

Here, we aim to investigate whether HSCs impose CX3CR1+ macrophages to protumorigenic properties in the peritumoral area. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of patients with HCC, a subpopulation of macrophages specifically expressed Arg1 and Cx3cr1 in the peritumoral area and were highly enriched with retinol metabolism-related genes. Flow cytometry analysis showed significantly increased frequencies of CD14+CD11b+HLA-DR- macrophages with CX3CR1 in the HCC adjacent region where \u03b1-smooth muscle actin-expressing activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) showed colocalized expression of CX3CL1. Accordingly, in tumor-bearing mice, Cx3cl1 mRNA expression was notably increased in aHSCs within the adjacent HCC, where infiltration of CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages was mostly observed with decreased CD8+ T cells. In adoptive transfer and in vitro coculture of myeloid cells, we demonstrated that CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages migrated and highly expressed arginase-1 by interacting with retinoid-enriched aHSCs in the adjacent HCC. Direct treatment of retinoids or coculturing with retinol-storing mouse aHSCs or human LX-2 cells significantly increased arginase-1 expression in CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages and human blood CD14+ cells, leading to the suppression of CD8+ T-cell proliferation. Moreover, genetic deficiency of CX3CR1 in myeloid cells or pharmacological inhibition of retinol metabolism remarkably attenuated HCC development. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages migrate and interact with aHSCs in the peritumoral region where retinoids induce arginase-1 expression in CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages, subsequently depriving CD8+ T cells of arginine and promoting HCC.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer commonly experience psychological distress, with female patients experiencing higher levels of psychological distress. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among circadian rhythm, sleep quality, inflammatory markers, and psychological distress in AYA patients with gynecological cancer in China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 75 AYA patients in treatment for gynecological cancer, 64 of whom completed the Chinese version of the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and the Distress Thermometer. Actigraphy was used to measure their objective sleep parameters: total sleep time, sleep onset latency, and sleep efficiency. Blood samples collected 3 times across 1 day were used to measure the average levels of interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. RESULTS: The mean score on the Distress Thermometer among respondents was 4.23, which was above the cutoff value for clinically significant psychological distress. High levels of psychological distress may be associated with circadian disturbances, poor sleep quality, and elevated inflammatory markers. In addition, total sleep time, sleep onset latency, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 averages were the dominant predictors of these AYA patients' psychological distress. CONCLUSION: Improving sleep quality and reducing the levels of inflammatory markers may relieve psychological distress among AYA patients with gynecological cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Healthcare professionals need to actively focus on circadian rhythm, inflammatory markers, sleep quality, and mental health status in AYA cancer patients to better meet their therapeutic and psychological needs.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate women's experiences of sequelae at 3, 6, and 12 months after mastectomy. METHODS: A survey including women \u226518 years, cognitively intact, and Danish speaking was conducted from May 2021 to October 2021. The researchers contacted the participants by telephone using 4 validated questionnaires investigating phantom sensation, body image, quality of life, and sexuality. RESULTS: Forty-four women were eligible for participation, and 23 (14 women aged \u226465 years and 9 women aged >66 years) were included in the analysis. The results showed an overall decrease in the severity of physical sequelae and an improvement in body image and sexual function. However, the women reported concerns about the future and decreased sexual enjoyment. Nearly half of the women received information about sexuality from healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated decreased sequelae during the follow-up period. Still, there seem to be unanswered questions concerning the quality of life and the content of information regarding sexuality. The findings require attention and further research to benefit the individual woman and her partner in accommodating the consequences after mastectomy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Persistent pain and concerns for the future are present for half of the women after 1 year. Information about possible changes in sexuality is not standard. A nurse-patient dialogue that discusses hospitalization and sexuality on an individual level can be a way to address concerns and challenges.",

Here, we characterized the diverse TMEs of IM and MO identified by whole-exome sequencing at single-cell resolution. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed parallel whole-exome sequencing and scRNA-seq on 23 samples from 7 patients to profile their TMEs when major results were validated by immunohistochemistry in the additional cohort. Integrative analysis of whole-exome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing found that malignant cells in IM showed higher intratumor heterogeneity, stemness, and more activated metabolism than those in MO. Tumors from IM shared similar TMEs while distinct TMEs were noticed in those from MO. Furthermore, CD20+ B cells, plasma cells, and conventional type II dendritic cells (cDC2s) were decreased in IM relative to MO while T cells in IM exhibited a more terminally exhausted capacity with a higher proportion of proliferative/exhausted T cells than that in MO. Both CD20 and CD1C correlated with better prognosis in multifocal HCC. Additionally, MMP9+ tumor-associated macrophages were enriched across IM and MO, which formed cellular niches with regulatory T cells and proliferative/exhausted T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings deeply decipher the heterogeneous TMEs between IM and MO, which provide a comprehensive landscape of multifocal HCC.",

However, the immune characteristics of PVTT remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to explore the immune microenvironment in PVTT. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Time-of-flight mass cytometry revealed that macrophages and monocytes were the dominant immune cell type in PVTT, with a higher proportion than in primary tumor and blood (54.1% vs. 26.3% and 9.1%, p<0.05). The differentially enriched clustering of inhibitory and regulatory immune cells in PVTT indicated an immune-suppressive environment. According to the single-cell RNA sequencing, TAM-C5AR1 was characterized by leukocyte chemotaxis and was the most common subpopulation in PVTT (36.7%). Multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry staining showed that the C5aR+ TAM/M\u03c6 were enriched in PVTT compared to both the primary tumor and liver and positively correlated with C5a (r=0.559, p<0.001). Notably, THP-1 (monocyte cell line) was recruited by CSQT2 (PVTT cell line) and exhibited up-regulation of CD163, CD206, and PD-L1 upon stimulation. C5aR antagonist could reverse this. C5aR+ TAMs could also inhibit Granzyme B in CD8+ T cells. High infiltration of C5aR+ TAMs in PVTT correlated with poor differentiation (p<0.009) and was a risk factor for overall survival (p=0.003) and for reformation of PVTT after resection (p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: TAMs, especially C5aR+ TAMs, were enriched in PVTT. C5aR+ TAMs contribute to the development of PVTT and poor prognosis by reshaping the immunosuppressive environment.",

We convened a diverse multidisciplinary group of cancer screening experts to evaluate current and future paradigms of HCC prevention and early detection using a rigorous Delphi panel approach. The experts had high agreement on 21 statements about primary prevention, HCC surveillance benefits, HCC surveillance harms, and the evaluation of emerging surveillance modalities. The experts agreed that current data have methodologic limitations as well as unclear generalizability to Western populations. Although a randomized clinical trial of surveillance versus no surveillance is unlikely feasible, they concurred that alternative designs, such as a comparison of 2 surveillance modalities, could provide indirect evidence of surveillance efficacy. The panel acknowledged the presence of surveillance harms, but concurred the overall value of surveillance appears high, particularly given a greater emphasis on benefits over harms by both patients and clinicians. The experts underscored the importance of a framework for measuring both benefits and harms when evaluating emerging surveillance strategies. The panel acknowledged performance metrics of emerging methods may differ from other cancer screening programs given differences in populations, including higher risk of cancer development and competing risk of morality, and differences in diagnostic workflow in patients at risk of HCC. These data provide insights into the perceived value of HCC surveillance in an era of emerging blood- and imaging-based surveillance strategies.",

Building on this foundation, this study extended our efforts to establish an extensive dosimetry dataset for Korean-specific iodine bioassay. We calculated bioassay functions (e.g., thyroid retention and urinary excretion functions), dose-per-content-functions, and content for the specified doses based on the Korean biokinetic model and dose coefficients previously developed. Also, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the practical impact of using Korean-specific dosimetry data. Compared to the ICRP reference data, the thyroid retention functions for Koreans were significantly lower (for I-131, peaks at 18% vs. 27%). The physical half-lives of radioiodine played a significant role in the differences of dose-per-content-function. For long-lived iodine isotopes such as I-125, the dose-per-content-functions were comparable to ICRP data, whereas for short-lived iodine isotopes such as I-131, the higher values were observed in the Korean data, indicating a greater dose estimation for a given iodine activity measured in the thyroid. Although we revealed the differences between Korean and ICRP reference data, the comprehensive understanding of Korean data suggests that using the Korean-specific data should be considered only when high doses are predicted.",

This post hoc analysis assessed efficacy and safety in Japanese patients. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC without prior systemic treatment were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 8 mg (body weight <60 kg) or 12 mg (body weight \u226560 kg) oral lenvatinib once daily plus 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. Dual primary end points were OS and PFS per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary end points were objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and time to progression per RECIST v1.1 by BICR and safety. RESULTS: Overall, 80 patients were enrolled in Japan (lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, n = 39; lenvatinib plus placebo, n = 41). Median time from randomization to database cutoff (June 21, 2022) was 34.1 months (range: 26.9-39.6). Median OS was 31.4 months (95% CI: 21.2- not reached) for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 21.4 months (95% CI: 14.4-25.4) for lenvatinib plus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.55 [95% CI: 0.31-0.96]). Median PFS for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was 10.4 months (95% CI: 6.2-18.5) and 6.5 months (95% CI: 6.0-8.3) for lenvatinib plus placebo (HR = 0.54 [95% CI: 0.32-0.90]). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 26 patients (67%) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 24 patients (59%) in the lenvatinib plus placebo group. CONCLUSION: In Japanese patients enrolled in LEAP-002, findings were consistent with the global population where OS and PFS trended toward improvement; a similar safety profile was observed.",

The prospective, observational REFINE study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of regorafenib in a broader population of patients in real-world clinical practice, including patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) \u22652, Child-Pugh B liver status, and sorafenib intolerance. METHODS: This international, prospective, multicenter study (NCT03289273) enrolled patients with uHCC for whom the decision to treat with regorafenib was made by their physician before enrollment, according to the local health authority-approved label. The primary aim was to evaluate the safety of regorafenib, including the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and dose modifications due to TEAEs. RESULTS: Of the 1,028 patients enrolled, 1,005 initiated regorafenib and were eligible for analysis. Median age was 66 years (range 21-94); most patients were male (83%), Child-Pugh A (61%), and had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 (82%) at study entry. Overall, 47%, 11%, and 40% of patients initiated regorafenib at 160, 120, and 80 mg/day, respectively. Median treatment duration was 3.7 months (range 1 day to 38.9 months). Dose modifications and permanent discontinuation of regorafenib due to TEAEs occurred in 45% and 31% of patients, respectively. The most common drug-related TEAEs were hand-foot skin reaction (31%), diarrhea (26%), and fatigue (15%). Median OS was 13.2 months (95% confidence interval 11.6, 14.8).

This study evaluated the effects of adjuvant ICI treatment duration on RFS and overall survival (OS) among patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence. METHODS: The RFS and OS of patients from three centers who received either adjuvant ICI therapy or active surveillance after curative hepatic resection between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023, were analyzed. Further analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of ICI treatment duration on RFS and OS. RESULTS: A total of 1,271 patients were included, of whom 1,032 (81.2%) received active surveillance and 239 (18.8%) received adjuvant ICI therapy. The median RFS in the adjuvant therapy cohort was 22.6 months (95% CI 18.3-26.9), significantly higher than the RFS of 19.1 months (95% CI 16.4-21.4) in the active surveillance cohort (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66-0.95; p = 0.019). The median OS was not reached for either group, but OS tended to be better in the adjuvant therapy cohort than in the active surveillance group (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.94; p = 0.010). Similar results were obtained after propensity score matching. Among patients who received adjuvant ICI therapy, those who received it for longer than 6 months had slightly higher RFS (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.42-1.04; p = 0.071) and OS (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.30-1.17; p = 0.128) than those who received it for up to 6 months.

This study aimed to evaluate the genetic landscape of liver tumors in patients with congenital porto-systemic shunts (CPSS) and correlate genotype with histological findings. METHODS: Nodules from patients with CPSS and sporadic pediatric focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or FNH-like nodules were evaluated histologically and sequenced for a panel of 50 genes using next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: Thirty-eight nodules from 17 patients with CPSS were histologically classified as hepatoblastomas (n = 2), hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 4), HNF-1\u03b1-inactivated hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) (n = 2), \u03b2-catenin-activated HCAs (n = 5), unclassified HCAs (n = 9), and FNH-like nodules (n = 16). CTNNB1 variants were detected in 26/38 nodules (68%) across different histological categories (2/2 hepatoblastomas, 4/4 HCCs, 10/16 HCAs, 10/16 FNH-like nodules), but not in sporadic FNH or FNH-like nodules (0/10). Less frequent variants were identified in APOB, GNAS, HNF1A, SERPINA1, MAML2, PTCH1, G6PC, KMT2C, DICER1, AXIN1, IL6ST and the promoter region of TERT. Germline variants were identified in AXIN1, HFE, SERPINA1, and ZNF521. CTNNB1 variants affecting amino acid positions 32 and 33 are more common in malignant tumors. Multiple CTNNB1 variants were identified in 6/7 (86%) of patients with multiple nodules, but no intratumoral variation was found. DISCUSSION: CPSS is strongly associated with nodules containing variants in CTNNB1, irrespective of the histological category. Areas in background liver containing these variants were also identified, and different variants could be identified in individual patients. The high proportion of CTNNB1 variants may explain the higher malignant potential of benign tumors found in CPSS.",

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), a synthetic polymer known for its hydrophilicity and biocompatibility, has long been used in drug delivery systems to prevent non-specific protein adsorption and to extend the blood circulation time of drug carriers and protein drugs. However, PEG has several drawbacks including poor stability, accumulated toxicity, and immunogenicity induced by repeated injections. Recently, zwitterionic polymers, known for their super-hydrophilic and antifouling properties, have been considered excellent alternatives to PEG. In this study, we synthesized a new zwitterionic polymer from biocompatible sodium alginate and lysine. METHODS: Sodium alginate (Alg) was conjugated with lysine (Lys) using the EDC/sulfo-NHS chemistry to form a zwitterionic alginate derivative (Alg-Lys). The biocompatibility was evaluated using in vitro cellular assays and in vivo animal studies. After further conjugation of zwitterionic near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye ZW800, an in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging study was conducted to evaluate the ability of Alg-Lys to enhance blood circulation time. RESULTS: Characterization of Alg-Lys showed that the carboxylic acid groups in Alg were completely replaced by Lys molecules. No cytotoxic effects were observed in the in vitro cytotoxicity tests of Alg-Lys-treated cancer cells and normal cells. Serum biochemical analysis confirmed the biocompatibility of Alg-Lys. ZW800-conjugated Alg-Lys exhibited strong fluorescence signals throughout the body 24 h after intravenous injection, whereas ZW800-conjugated Alg was rapidly removed from the body.

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers innovative solutions, such as automated systems for increased availability and personalized treatments to improve psychotherapy. Nonetheless, ethical concerns about AI integration in mental health care remain. This narrative review explores the literature on AI applications in psychotherapy, focusing on their mechanisms, effectiveness, and ethical implications, particularly for depressive and anxiety disorders. COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA: A review was conducted, spanning studies from January 2009 to December 2023, focusing on empirical evidence of AI's impact on psychotherapy. Following PRISMA guidelines, the authors independently screened and selected relevant articles. The analysis of 28 studies provided a comprehensive understanding of AI's role in the field. The results suggest that AI can enhance psychotherapy interventions for people with anxiety and depression, especially chatbots and internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy. However, to achieve optimal outcomes, the ethical integration of AI necessitates resolving concerns about privacy, trust, and interaction between humans and AI. CONCLUSION: The study emphasizes the potential of AI-powered cognitive-behavioral therapy and conversational chatbots to address symptoms of anxiety and depression effectively. The article highlights the importance of cautiously integrating AI into mental health services, considering privacy, trust, and the relationship between humans and AI.

We then leverage the vast amount of genomics data available for these repositories to credential our resource and uncover mtDNA-related biology. Using already existing proteomics data, we show that variation in mtCN can be predicted by variation in TFAM, histone, and mitochondrial ribosome protein abundance. We also integrate mtCN estimates with the CRISPR gene dependency measurements to find that cell lines with high mtCN are resistant to loss of GPX4, a glutathione phospholipid hydroperoxidase.

The ratio of positive and resected lymph nodes (LNR) and log odds of positive nodes (LODDS) emerged as novel prognostic markers in deciding the future course of management better than the parameter pN in predicting cancer-specific survival. We aim to evaluate and compare the prognostic value of pN, LNR and LODDS in common primary organ malignancies like breast, head and neck, gastric and cervical cancers. METHODS: This was an ambidirectional observational study conducted from September 2018 to August 2021 with one year (from 2017 to 2018) for retrospective data collection archived from records. It included patients affected by breast, head and neck, gastric and cervical cancers and were followed up for a period of 3 years from the date of diagnosis to perform a holistic survival analysis.

The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunoexpression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma cervix and study the distribution of clinicopathological features and recurrence of cervical cancer with respect to PD-L1 status. METHODS: A total of 140 patients were included in this multicentric ambidirectional study. Immunohistochemical analysis for PD-L1 was performed on paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed sections using 22C3 PharmDx assay (Dako) and tumour proportion score was calculated. PD-L1 expression status concerning the distribution of clinicopathological features was further studied. RESULTS: This study included 133 cases of cervical carcinoma and 7 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (140 cases), with a prevalence of PDL1 positivity in 31.4% of cases with 15% (n = 21) tumours high positive, 16.4% (n = 23) low positive and 68.6% (n = 96) negative for PD-L1. It was observed that all cases with PD-L1 positivity were characterized as squamous cell carcinoma. The mean age of subjects was 56.74 \u00b1 11.52 years. PD-L1 high positivity was observed in 26.7% of individuals in the age group >70 years, 21.7% of grade 3 tumours, 11.4% of tumours exceeding 4 cm in size, and 33.3% of cases showing recurrence. PD-L1 immunoexpression did not demonstrate a significant association with the patient's age, tumour grade and stage, as well as recurrence. CONCLUSION: It is envisaged that anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy could show promising antitumour activity and early survival rates among patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a heterogenous group of diseases with steroid hormone dependant carcinogenesis. Along with Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2), androgen receptor (AR) is now emerging to play key role in disease progression of various molecular breast cancer subtypes especially triple negative breast cancers. Aim of this study was to find out prevalence of AR positivity in all breast cancers, correlation of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67 index with AR positivity. To find out correlation of AR positivity with histological grade. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study done on 55 primary breast carcinoma cases. Routine Hematoxylin and Eosin stain as well as immunohistochemical ER, PR, HER2/neu, Ki67 and AR stain were done. The outcome was assessed in the form of relationship between AR and ER, PR, HER2 status and Ki-67 index and histopathological grade. RESULTS: AR positivity was seen in 69% of all breast cancers. AR positivity was seen in 8% of triple negative breast cancers. High Ki67 index showed 55% AR positivity. Grade II breast cancers showed 42% AR positivity. CONCLUSION: Cases with triple negative breast cancers have worst prognosis. Unlike targeted novel hormone therapy (tamoxifen) in luminal cancers and monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab) in her2 enriched cancers, AR is looked upon as a target to treat triple negative breast cancer. However, the existing controversies demand more AR related studies.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age. Recently, it was discovered that microRNAs (miRNAs), which circulate freely in the circulation or biofluids, have diagnostic or prognostic potential. The current study looked at the levels of expression of three miRNAs in the serum and follicular fluid (FF) of PCOS patients and healthy women. METHOD: We have shortlisted the most studied miRNAs-miR-21, miR-222, and Let-7b-from the previous literature, followed by individual quantification using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The present study results showed differences in the expression of miR-21, miR-222, and Let-7b in PCOS patients compared to controls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for miR-21, miR-222, and Let-7b was 0.70, 0.65, and 0.75 in serum and 0.55, 0.66, and 0.59 in FFs, respectively. The combined ROC of the three miRNAs showed an AUC 0.86 for serum and 0.62 for FF samples. miR-21 showed a positive correlation with body mass index (BMI), and luteinizing hormone (LH) level; miR-222 showed a positive correlation with LH, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and 2-h plasma glucose (PG); while anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), age, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and 2-h PG were found to be negatively correlated with Let-b expression. Regression analyses showed a negative association of miR-21 with menarche, progesterone, menses, and antral follicle count (AFC), while serum miR-222 was associated with BMI and age. Let 7-b had a negative association with serum, oocytes, and the LH/FSH ratio. Bioinformatics indicates their predicted targets are potentially involved in microRNA in cancer, diabetes, the P53 signaling pathway, prolactin signaling, the Hippo signaling pathway, Ras signaling, and pathways in cancer. CONCLUSION: The study found that serum Let-7b, miR-222, and miR-21 were differentially expressed in PCOS patients, suggesting potential involvement in the pathogenesis or progression of PCOS.",

METHODS: Fifty patients and negative controls each were selected for the study. A 10 ml voided urine specimen was processed for urine cytology to prepare LBC smears. For urinary FISH analysis, 50 ml of voided urine was processed using multi-target FISH-containing probes for the centromeres of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 and the 9p21 locus. Histopathological examination of transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) chips was performed on diseased cases only. RESULTS: All 50 diseased cases exhibited 62%, 80%, 76%, and 68% of uFISH sensitivity, uFISH specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) respectively. Among negative controls, results of 40%, 84%, 71%, and 58% for LBC sensitivity, LBC specificity, PPV, and NPV were found, respectively. Among the diseased cases uFISH positivity of 20%, 45%, 83.3%, 82.4% and 100% for Ta, T1, T2a, T2b and T3 respectively. Among the diseased cases LBC positivity was 0%, 20%, 33.3%, 70% and 100% for Ta, T1, T2a, T2b and T3 respectively. CONCLUSION: Increased sensitivity and specificity of uFISH than LBC urine to detect urothelial carcinoma (UC) reflect the better potentiality of the former to detect UCs. The limitations of uFISH analysis include sophisticated equipment, higher cost, and experienced cytopathologists/technicians. It is proposed to conduct more such prospective trials with recent biomarkers so as to reduce the frequency of cystoscopy in such patients.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 46 eyes of 45 patients who received 106Ru brachytherapy for the treatment of various intraocular tumors in the Department of Ophthalmology of Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, between April 2013 and December 2020. RESULTS: Of 46 eyes, 21 (46%) were diagnosed with small to medium choroidal melanoma, 13 (28%) with retinoblastoma, 4 (9%) with choroidal metastases, 2 (4%) with retinal vasoproliferative tumor (VPT), 3 (7%) with choroidal hemangioma (CH), 2 (4%) with RPE adenoma, and 1 (2%) with retinal hemangioblastoma. The mean tumor thickness was 4.8\u2009mm (range, 2.4-6.6). After a mean follow-up of 62.4\u2009months (range, 4.8-122.7), local tumor control was achieved in 39 eyes (85%), which were 100% for choroidal melanoma, 46% for RB, 100% for choroidal metastasis and 100% for benign tumors. Radiation-related complications were found in 28 eyes (61%), including cataracts in 10 (25%), radiation retinopathy in 14 (30%), radiation maculopathy in 14 (30%), radiation papillopathy in 6 (13%), and vitreous hemorrhage in 3 (7%) eyes. All patients with retinoblastoma currently alive without metastasis. Two patients with choroidal melanoma developed systemic metastases and three patients with choroidal metastases died at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with intraocular tumors treated with 106Ru brachytherapy showed excellent outcomes in relation to tumor control with few complications.",

Although only 5 % of cancers are diagnosed in this age group, malignancies represent a significant burden in terms of years of healthy life lost and the consequences of cancer treatment. Important issues for young patients include diagnostic delay, promotion of primary prevention, biologically distinct tumor types, oncogenetic evaluation, unique psychosocial challenges, fertility issues, monitoring of adverse effects of treatment including the development of secondary malignancies, or the absence of age-specific clinical trials. The centralization of care and the formation of multidisciplinary teams dedicated to young patients will allow for a more comprehensive approach with a focus on these issues.

        "AbstractText": "Learning classification models from real-world data often requires substantial human effort devoted to instance annotation. As the instance-based annotating process can be very time-consuming and costly, we propose a novel active learning framework that builds classification models from human-annotated regions. A region is defined by a set of conjunctive patterns that are formed by value ranges over the input features. A region label is a human assessment of the class proportion in the data population covered by the region. By leveraging learning from label proportions algorithms, regions and their class proportions can be used to train instance-based classification models. However, the key challenge is that in practice, very few regions are defined already. Therefore, to identify regions important for model learning, we design a hierarchical active learning (HAL) framework, which actively builds a hierarchy of regions. Similar to the decision-tree learning process, our approach progressively divides the input data space into smaller sub-regions, solicits labels for the new regions, and retrains the base classification model with all the leaf regions. And we further develop a multi-hierarchy (forest) solution, which builds multiple shallower hierarchies that have more informative, diverse, and simpler regions. We evaluate our HAL framework on numerous impactful classification datasets as well as on a real user study - on the survival analysis of colorectal cancer patients. The results demonstrate that region-based active learning methods can learn high-quality classifiers from very few labeled regions. Hence, our framework is shown very effective in reducing the human annotation effort needed for building classification models.",

The association of increased adrenal steroids with breast cancer may indicate a causal role. However, administration of DHEA to rats and mice has shown a beneficial effect of DHEA in preventing or suppressing breast cancer in numerous studies. DHEA treatment inhibits the development of spontaneous virally induced mammary cancers and suppresses carcinogen-induced as well as radiation-induced mammary tumors. DHEA also antagonizes the effect of estrogen on growth of human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice. DHEA is effective in suppressing cancer development in other organ systems as well including lung, liver, colon, prostate, lymphatic, and skin cancers. We hypothesize that the increase of DHEA in breast fluid and serum is the result of stress-induced adrenal activation and that the glucocorticoid component is the detrimental component rather than DHEA or DS. The mechanisms by which DHEA suppresses tumor growth includes the non-competitive inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis, immune suppression of virally induced breast cancer, enhancement of natural killer cell cytotoxicity by both DHEA and DS, suppression of IL-6, and promotion of estrogen receptor beta expression. The evidence supports the use of DHEA or its derivatives for suppression of cancers regardless of the mechanism by which the cancer arises.",

        "AbstractText": "Iron is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including oxygen transport, DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Iron homeostasis is a critical biological equilibrium that involves the balance of iron absorption, utilization, storage and excretion. Iron is intricately linked to the pathophysiology of cancer. Its dual role as a vital nutrient and a potential carcinogen highlights the complexity of iron's influence on tumorigenesis. Iron balance is finely tuned through a complex interplay of molecular components and regulatory mechanisms. Hepcidin, a liver-derived peptide hormone, is the principal regulator of systemic iron availability. Hepcidin exerts its effects by binding to the iron export protein ferroportin (FPN1), leading to its internalization and degradation, which in turn reduces the release of iron from macrophages and the intestinal absorption of dietary iron. In human cancers, the expression of hepcidin is significantly altered, leading to increased iron absorption and retention. Hepcidin has emerged as a significant player in cancer biology due to its potential as both a tumor suppressor and a promoter. Understanding the context-dependent role of hepcidin in cancer opens avenues for novel therapeutic strategies. Modulating hepcidin levels or its activity could be a potential approach to treat cancer, either by starving tumors of iron or by normalizing the iron-rich microenvironment to enhance the efficacy of existing cancer treatments. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the critical functions of hepcidin in iron metabolism, summarize the upstream regulatory factors that control the expression of hepcidin, and delve deeply into the downstream signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms by which hepcidin regulates the tumorigenesis, as well as elucidate the promising potential of hepcidin as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cancer, underscoring the significance of understanding and harnessing the complex interplay between hepcidin, iron metabolism and cancer biology.",

Decades of pre-clinical studies elucidated the route that certain cancer cells take to gain the cancer hallmark of uncontrolled proliferation, uncovering CDK4/6 as key players. Further investigation into the molecular underpinnings of this process revealed interconnected signaling between the CDK4/6 and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling axes, providing evidence that CDK4/6i would be particularly relevant in estrogen-driven cancers. Three FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, were independently developed and all exhibited efficacy against in vivo models of ER+\u00a0breast cancer. Clinical trials then confirmed the safety and efficacy of these drugs in patients. Ongoing clinical trials are now testing CDK4/6i in several other cancer models, including other hormone-driven cancers. Further mechanistic insights should reveal predictive biomarkers of response, and potential combination therapies to overcome resistance.

        "AbstractText": "The Estrogen Receptor (ER) is a well-established regulator of the biologic behavior of breast cancer and a biomarker of response to endocrine treatments. Other steroid and non-steroid nuclear receptors, including Progesterone Receptor (PR), Androgen Receptor (AR), Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) and Thyroid Receptors (TRs), are often co-expressed with ER in breast cancers and modulate its biologic effects. In addition these receptors are also expressed in sub-sets of ER negative breast cancers and act as alternative transcription factors with cancer associated effects. The isotypes of TRs, TR\u03b1, TR\u03b2, and other receptors of hormones of the thyroid axis such as the surface thyroid receptor, \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin and the receptor for TSH, TSH-R expressed in sub-sets of breast cancers, have both pro-carcinogenic and anti-carcinogenic functions that depend on the specific cancer cell environment. For TRs, co-expression of ER is important for their respective transcriptional output as these nuclear receptors interact at the chromatin level. The surface \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptor, on the other hand, activates signal transduction pathways that may affect ER function and its ability to execute its transcriptional program. Based on the role of the thyroid axis in breast cancer tissues, therapeutic opportunities from the manipulation of the axis in breast cancer arise, and initial studies have been performed with intriguing results. A biomarker based approach taking into consideration the breast cancer sub-types, including expression of other nuclear receptors and the expression of nuclear and surface thyroid receptors in breast cancer cells, could provide therapeutic opportunities, in a personalized manner.",

        "AbstractText": "Prolactin-secreting adenomas comprise approximately 50\u00a0% of all clinically relevant pituitary adenomas. Most men with prolactinomas present with large and invasive tumors. Despite effective medical therapy with dopamine agonists and prolactin normalization, over 20\u00a0% of men with prolactinomas will remain with hypogonadism. There are two suggested mechanisms for hypogonadism: central suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis caused by elevated prolactin levels leading to inhibition of the kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamus and loss of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion, and tumor mass effect with compression of the normal pituitary tissue and destruction of gonadotroph cells. Hypogonadism in men results in sexual dysfunction, low libido, anemia, fatigue, and infertility. Identification of patients who are likely to recover the damaged gonadal axis upon prolactin suppression is important. These are men that harbor smaller tumors, with higher testosterone levels at diagnosis, no visual field defects, and without impairment in the secretion of other pituitary hormones. Testosterone replacement should be offered to patients with lower chance of restoring normal function of the gonadal axis. However, most men will achieve spontaneous recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis within 12 months after prolactin normalization. For men with prolactinoma and hypogonadism persistence who wish to restore fertility, treatment with gonadotropins or with clomiphene citrate has been found to be safe and effective. In the present review, we propose an algorithm for the management of hypogonadism persistence in men with macroprolactinomas.",

These aldosterone-producing lesions above are frequently accompanied by somatic mutations, including those of KCNJ5, CACNA1D, ATP1A1, and ATP2B3. APA is a neoplasm which frequently harbors KCNJ5 somatic mutations in tumor cells, especially those arising in East Asian patients. Histologically, APAs with KCNJ5 and ATP2B3 mutations presented with more clear cells, whereas those with ATP1A1 and CACNA1D mutations with more compact cells. In addition, the expression levels of steroidogenic enzymes such as aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) in APAs varied among those with different patterns of somatic mutations, suggesting a potential association between specific mutations and altered aldosterone synthesis in APAs. In contrast, CACNA1D mutation was the most frequent subtype in non-neoplastic lesions including APM and APN, suggesting the possible correlation of KCNJ5 mutation with neoplastic aldosterone-producing lesions. This review provides pivotal insights into the histopathological diversity of aldosterone-producing lesions in PA patients and emphasizes the significance of genetic mutations in constituting the histological landscape of the lesion in order to better understand the detailed pathogenesis of primary aldosteronism.",

Many studies have revealed the molecular mechanisms involved with SHRs. Cancer specific aberrant expression pattern of SHR and variation in their mechanism created an opportunity to specifically target SHRs for developing highly effective anti-cancer therapeutics. Further, these receptors can be targeted using different nanodelivery systems thus proving to be a potent target. The anticancer nanodelivery system can selectively target cancer cells due to the newly discovered aberrant nature of SHRs in cancer making it unique from other membrane bound receptors that are relatively more easily accessible as these are mostly overexpressed on the surface of the cells. One such interesting receptor which is present in the cytoplasm of the cells and ubiquitously expressed in both cancer and non-cancer cells is glucocorticoid receptor (GR). GR as studied earlier behaves in a unique way in cancer cells which facilitates the nanodelivery system including small molecules to selectively target cytoplasmic GR and hence makes the anticancer therapeutics more precise in its own way. Here, we will summarize the knowledge of SHR providing information about its role in its molecular mechanisms in cells and mostly to dig into its anticancer therapeutic roles in cancer cells.

Participants completed measures on demographics and body image perceptions and satisfaction. Body image discrepancy was calculated using the Figure Rating Scale, which assessed their current and ideal body images, and body satisfaction was examined using the 9-item Body Areas Satisfaction Subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. BMI was computed from objective measures of height and weight and categorized as normal weight (BMI = 18.5 - 24.9), overweight (BMI = 25.0 - 29.9), and obese (BMI \u2265 30). Results showed a negative association between body image discrepancy and body satisfaction, such that as body image discrepancy increased, body satisfaction decreased. This relationship was moderated by BMI. Stratified analyses indicated that increases in body image discrepancy were associated with decreases in body satisfaction only among men with normal and obese weight but not among men with overweight. These findings suggest that researchers and healthcare providers may need to consider weight category when developing cancer and diabetes risk reduction interventions to address overweight and obesity in Latinx men. For Latinx men with overweight, interventions may need to focus on other health metrics to engage them in weight management strategies.",

        "AbstractText": "Over the last few decades, diffusion MRI (dMRI) streamline tractography has emerged as the dominant method forin vivoestimation of white matter (WM) pathways in the brain. One key limitation to this technique is that modern tractography implementations require high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). However, HARDI can be difficult to collect clinically, limiting the reach of tractography analyses to research cohorts and thus limiting many WM investigations to certain populations and pathologies. As such, a clinically viable tractography solution applicable to wider patient populations scanned as a part of routine care would be of key significance in broadening WM analyses to underfunded or rarer diseases and to the clinical setting. Such a solution would require the ability to perform arbitrary tractography analyses, use only clinical imaging for input, and be open source and widely accessible and implementable. Thus, here we evaluate our recently developed, containerized, and open-source, T1-weighted (T1w) MRI-based deep learning model for streamline propagation. We empirically assess its performance against traditional dMRI-based and established atlas-based approaches in a healthy young population, an aging one, and in those with epilepsy, depression, and brain cancer. In the healthy young population, we find slightly increased error compared to traditional tractography with the deep learning model that falls within the bounds attributable to dMRI variability and is considerably less than the atlas-based approach. Further, seeking to replicate previously published dMRI tractography effects in the remaining cohorts as an initial assessment of clinical viability, we find this model successfully does so in some key cases-particularly in applications that rely on long-range streamlines including those not captured by the atlas-based approach-but importantly not all. These results suggest a deep learning-based approach to tractography with T1w MRI demonstrates promise within the limitations of our definition of clinical viability and especially over atlas-based approaches but requires refinement and more robust consideration of out-of-distribution effects prior to widespread clinical use. We also find these results raise additional questions regarding the differences in image content between dMRI and T1w MRI and their relationship to tractography. Further investigation of these questions will improve the field's understanding of which features of the brain influence measured tractography effects.",

Unfortunately, when the external data are fully or partially incompatible with the current trial data, type I error rates can be highly inflated under traditional blanket discounting schemes such as power priors, commensurate priors, and meta-analytic predictive priors. However, such inflation of the probability of a false positive can be necessary, as the alternative is to have an underpowered study. For clinical trials with time-to-event (TTE) outcomes, this problem is exacerbated since many observations are censored. In this paper, we develop the latent exchangeability prior for TTE data. We also present a novel framework to borrow information about the treatment effect between groups as well as incorporate information from external controls. Simulation results suggest that, although efficiency gains can be achieved by borrowing information among external controls, operating characteristics in general can be quite poor under a lack of exchangeability. We apply our approach to a real clinical trial in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "We propose a new method for the simultaneous selection and estimation of multivariate sparse additive models with correlated errors. Our method called Covariance Assisted Multivariate Penalized Additive Regression (CoMPAdRe) simultaneously selects among null, linear, and smooth non-linear effects for each predictor while incorporating joint estimation of the sparse residual structure among responses, with the motivation that accounting for inter-response correlation structure can lead to improved accuracy in variable selection and estimation efficiency. CoMPAdRe is constructed in a computationally efficient way that allows the selection and estimation of linear and non-linear covariates to be conducted in parallel across responses. Compared to single-response approaches that marginally select linear and non-linear covariate effects, we demonstrate in simulation studies that the joint multivariate modeling leads to gains in both estimation efficiency and selection accuracy, of greater magnitude in settings where signal is moderate relative to the level of noise. We apply our approach to protein-mRNA expression levels from multiple breast cancer pathways obtained from The Cancer Proteome Atlas and characterize both mRNA-protein associations and protein-protein subnetworks for each pathway. We find non-linear mRNA-protein associations for the Core Reactive, EMT, PIK-AKT, and RTK pathways. Supplementary Materials are available online.",

        "AbstractText": "The contemporary epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shows a shift in the main etiological risk factors from less common but highly virulent (eg, hepatitis C and B) to more common but weak risk factors (eg, alcohol and metabolic syndrome). Therefore, we are in a seemingly paradoxical state of declining overall incidence rates of HCC-related to improved prevention and treatment of viral hepatitis but burgeoning number of people at an elevated risk of HCC. Several geographic regions have reported an increase in HCC attributable to alcoholic liver disease and metabolic dysfunction associated with steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The importance of risk stratification is increasing to allow for targeted prevention and early detection of HCC. Most risk factors predispose HCC through the formation of cirrhosis, which has served as the main risk stratifying factor. However, this scheme is showing cracks at both ends of the spectrum. On one hand, the risk of developing HCC varies widely among patients with contemporary advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and on the other hand up to one-third of MASLD-related HCC occurs among patients with no clear evidence of cirrhosis. The use of multidimensional (eg, clinical, epidemiological, and biochemical) predictive algorithms may improve risk stratification efforts. The shift in HCC risk factors also further heightened the importance and limitations of current surveillance practices (eg, reduced performance of ultrasound in MASLD). Therefore, exploring advanced imaging methods, new biomarkers but also existing combinations of biomarkers augmented by clinical factors for HCC early detection is crucial.",

        "AbstractText": "Solid organ tumors can be treated using focal laser ablation in which a needle housing a laser fiber is inserted into a tumor and oncologic control is achieved through thermally induced tissue coagulation. The key advantage of this procedure over conventional approaches is that it has few side-effects due to its minimally invasive nature. However, the lack of an inexpensive and accurate monitoring modality hinders widespread adoption. To address this unmet need, we have developed an optical probe capable of accurately monitoring the ablation procedure in real-time, thus ensuring complete coagulation of the cancerous tissue. This is achieved by placing the probe at the desired ablation boundary and interrogating laser-tissue interaction in real-time to detect the onset and propagation of the coagulation boundary. Here, we validate this novel monitoring modality through in silico, ex vivo and in vivo studies. Monte Carlo simulation is performed to demonstrate the utility of the probe in a range of tissues including prostate, liver and brain. In all cases the virtual optical probe is capable of detecting the coagulation boundary without any tissue specific calibration. Next, an ex vivo bovine liver study is presented in which laser ablation under optical probe monitoring is shown to be capable of creating ablation zones with a radial accuracy better than 1mm. Finally, case studies from the first clinical trial of this technology are presented showing successful adoption of this technique for monitoring laser ablation of prostate cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Gaussian graphical regression is a powerful approach for regressing the precision matrix of a Gaussian graphical model on covariates, which permits the response variables and covariates to outnumber the sample size. However, traditional approaches of fitting the model via separate node-wise lasso regressions overlook the network-induced structure among these regressions, leading to high error rates, particularly when the number of nodes is large. To address this issue, we propose a multi-task learning estimator for fitting Gaussian graphical regression models, which incorporates a cross-task group sparsity penalty and a within-task element-wise sparsity penalty to govern the sparsity of active covariates and their effects on the graph, respectively. We also develop an efficient augmented Lagrangian algorithm for computation, which solves subproblems with a semi-smooth Newton method. We further prove that our multi-task learning estimator has considerably lower error rates than the separate node-wise regression estimates, as the cross-task penalty enables borrowing information across tasks. We examine the utility of our method through simulations and an application to a gene co-expression network study with brain cancer patients.",

        "AbstractText": "In neuroblastoma, MCYN amplification is associated with survival rates of <50%. Overexpression of the mitotic kinases Aurora-A and Aurora-B are also associated with low survival and exacerbate the oncogenic effects of N-Myc. As N-Myc is stabilized by Aurora-A, Aurora-A targeting proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been developed that reduce Aurora-A and N-Myc levels. However, simultaneous degradation of N-Myc, Aurora-A, and Aurora-B has not been previously achieved. Given the contributions of both Aurora kinases to MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, we designed PROTACs capable of degrading both Aurora-A and Aurora-B. Dual-degrading PROTACs dAurAB2 and dAurAB5 potently degraded Aurora-A (DC50 = 59 nM and 8.8 nM, respectively) and Aurora-B (DC50 = 39 nM and 6.1 nM), eliminated 89% - 97% of Aurora-A and Aurora-B, and reduced N-Myc levels by 38% and 45% in MCYN-amplified IMR32 neuroblastoma cells. Global proteomics screening revealed that while dAurAB2 demonstrated good selectivity, dAurAB5 downregulated additional targets including threonine tyrosine kinase (TTK). Interestingly, TKK is also associated with MCYN-amplified neuroblastoma, and multi-target PROTAC dAurAB5 reduced the viability of neuroblastoma IMR32 cells by 55% at 24 hours. The development of dAurAB2 and dAurAB5 generates new modalities for inhibiting the oncogenic activities of Aurora-A, Aurora-B, N-Myc, and TTK in neuroblastoma and other cancers.",

We indwelt an F20 pelvic drainage tube for each of the patients, which were connected to an anti-reflux drainage bag for those in the norPD group and a 200 ml negative pressure ball for those in the negPD group, and removed the tubes at the drainage volume \u226430 ml/d. We compared the operation time, intraoperative blood loss, drainage volume on the first day after surgery, total postoperative drainage volume, drainage tube-indwelling duration, drainage tube-related nursing time, urinary catheter removal time, wound healing time, and incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups of patients. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of operation time, intraoperative blood loss, wound healing time, and postoperative complications (P>0.05). The drainage volume on the first postoperative day and the total postoperative drainage volume were significantly lower, and the drainage tube-indwelling duration and drainage tube-related nursing time markedly shorter in the norPD than in the negPD group (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Normal-pressure drainage is a safe and effective drainage method after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, which can significantly reduce the postoperative drainage volume, drainage tube-indwelling duration and drainage tube-related nursing time.",

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological features of 65 cases of UBUC and 38 cases of UBUC + IPCa after radical cystoprostatectomy (RCP) from January 2017 to February 2020. We compared their expressions of the immunohistochemical markers androgen receptor (AR) and (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2,HER2) between the two groups of patients, and analyzed their clinicopathological characteristics by chi-square test and their survival rates using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULTS: The detection rate of UBUC + IPCa was 16.5%, and that of clinically significant IPCa was 39.5%, with preoperative PSA\u22654 \u03bcg/L in 23.7% of the patients. Compared with the patients with UBUC, most of the UBUC + IPCa cases had no smoking history (73.8% vs 92.1%, P = 0.024), and fewer had histological variants (43.1% vs 10.5%, P = 0.003). The incidence rate of vascular invasion was significantly higher in the UBUC than in the UBUC + IPCa group (49.2% vs 21.1%, P = 0.005), and so was the rate of advanced cases (67.7% vs 31.6%, P<0.001). In comparison with the patients of the UBUC group, those of the UBUC + IPCa group showed remarkably higher expressions of AR (9.2% vs 31.6%, P = 0.004) and HER2 (43.1% vs 71.1%, P = 0.006).

CONCLUSION: Standardized sampling of prostate samples after RCP helps to improve the detection rate of IPCa. Preoperative level of PSA is not a good predictor of IPCa. Few patients with UBUC + IPCa have a history of cigarette smoking, and the predominant histological type of the malignancy is high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma, which is not significantly different from UBUC in prognosis. The expressions of HER2 and AR are significantly higher in UBUC + IPCa than in UBUC, suggesting that UBUC + IPCa may benefit from HER2- and AR-targeted therapy.",

We detected the expressions of PRMT5 and DKK3 in the prostate tissues of the patients by immunohistochemistry, analyzed the correlation of the expression levels of PRMT5 and DKK3 using the Spearman method, and conducted a multivariate analysis of postoperative BR of the malignancy using the Cox multivariate regression model. RESULTS: The positive expression of PRMT5 was significantly higher while that of DKK3 remarkably lower in the PCa than in the adjacent tissue (P<0.05). Spearman correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between the expression levels of PRMT5 and DKK3 in the PCa tissue (r = \uff0d0.532, P<0.05).

According to the smoking status of their husbands, we divided the subjects into a smoking group (n = 345), a non-smoking group (n =387), and a smoking cessation group (n =129), collected their general demographics, anthropometric indexes, laboratory results and pregnancy outcomes, compared them among the three groups, and analyzed the relationship of SSC with the pregnancy outcomes of the PCOS patients. RESULTS: The levels of total testosterone (T) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the smoking cessation group were similar to those in the non-smoking group, but significantly lower than those in the smoking group (P= 0.014 and P= 0.011).

Using R language and the Seurat package, we performed cell clustering and annotation, selected the subpopulations of epithelial cells for differential analysis after quality control and cell type identification, and conducted enrichment analysis of the identified differential genes using the Hiplot website. Then we downloaded the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci corresponding to the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) of these genes from the UK Biobank (UKB) database, and the clinical data and corresponding gene expression data on PCa patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), followed by univariate COX regression analysis of the impact of the genes on the prognosis of the patients after Mendelian randomization. RESULTS: A total of 1 566 genes were identified and subjected to enrichment analysis, which indicated that the differential genes might be enriched in the Ras, apoptosis and oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathways. Subsequent Mendelian randomization revealed 74 potential causal genes among the 1 566 genes, and univariate COX regression analysis of the 74 genes identified 4 possibly related genes FAM3B, JUNB, TMEM59, and KRT5. Comparison of the results of Mendelian randomization and univariate COX regression showed that KRT5 might be the most important gene influencing PCa.

METHODS: A total of 103 PCa patients underwent androgen-deprivation therapy + double-agent chemotherapy from May 2018 to May 2021. We collected the clinical data from the patients, determined their genotypes using the PCR-PFLP method, analyzed the association of the locus polymorphisms of GSTP1-rs1695 and XRCC1-rs25487 with chemotherapy sensitivity, and investigated the correlation of GSTP1 and XRCC1 gene polymorphisms with the 3-year survival rate of the patients. RESULTS: The distribution of GSTP1-rs1695 and XRCC1-rs25487 loci in the 103 PCa patients receiving chemotherapy was consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (\u03c72 = 9.794, P > 0.05). At the GSTP1-rs1695 locus, the AA genotype accounted for 65.05% (67/103), the AG genotype 23.30% (24/103) and the GG genotype 11.65% (12/103); at the XRCC1-rs25487 locus, the AA genotype accounted for 29.13% (30/103), the AG genotype 50.49% (52/103) and the GG genotype 20.39% (21/103). Chemotherapy sensitivity was significantly lower in the patients with the GSTP1-rs1695 AA type than in those with the AG/GG types (35.82% vs 58.33%, P <0.05), but showed no statistically significant difference between the XRCC1-rs25487 AA and AG/GG types (40.00% vs 45.21%, P > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate between the patients with different GSTP1-rs1695 and XRCC1-rs25487 phenotypes (P > 0.05). The 3-year overall survival rate was lower in the patients with the GSTP1-rs1695 AA type than in those with the AG/GG types, and so was it in those with the XRCC1-rs25487 AA type than in those with the AG/GG types (P < 0.05). Multivariate COX regression analysis showed that the GSTP1-rs1695 AA and XRCC1-rs25487 AA types were independent factors affecting the 3-year overall survival of the patients after chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Both GSTP1-rs1695 and XRCC1-rs25487 gene polymorphisms have some influence on chemotherapy sensitivity and prognosis in PCa patients. The A allele mutations of GSTP1-rs1695 and XRCC1-rs25487 can decrease the 3-year survival rate, while their G allele mutations may help improve chemotherapy sensitivity and survival.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation of early urinary continence (UC) after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) with relevant preoperative MRI parameters of the urinary tract structure and provide some theoretical evidence for screening the high-risk population with postoperative urinary incontinence. METHODS: This study included 49 PCa patients aged 50\uff0d78 years treated by LRP in Beijing Tongren Hospital from January 2015 to February 2021, and all followed up for 12 months. We collected the complete baseline data on the patients, the clinical data possibly related to early postoperative UC, the MRI anatomical parameters associated with UC, and the data on the recovery of early postoperative UC. We recorded the number of urinary pads used, submitted the data obtained to SPSS 23.0 statistical analysis, and identified the possible relevant factors by univariate correlation analysis, followed by R4 0.3 or SPSS 23.0 multivariate logistic regression analysis of the included factors and the results of UC. RESULTS: MRI images manifested that the prostate anteroposterior diameter averaged (4.0 \u00b1 1.11) cm, the transverse diameter (4.6 \u00b1 0.83) cm, the cephalocaudal diameter 2.4\uff0d6.4 cm, the membranous urethral length (MUL) (13.16 \u00b1 3.52) mm, and the thickness of the urethral rhabdosphincter (URS) 1.08\uff0d4.37 mm. Multivariate analysis showed that age was significantly correlated with the recovery of UC at 1 month after LRP (P\uff1d 0.035, OR = 0.16), and so was the URS thickness at 3 months (P\uff1d 0.011, OR = 0.02), 9 months (P\uff1d 0.014, OR = 0.039) and 12 months (P\uff1d 0.014, OR = 0.039). Urinary incontinence with the URS thickness \u22641.6 mm at 12 months after operation was found of a high severity (P\uff1d 0.010, OR \uff3b95% CI\uff3d = 0.858\uff0d6.240). The MUL was positively correlated with the recovery of UC at 9 months (P\uff1d 0.024, OR = 0.508) and 12 months (P\uff1d 0.024, OR = 0.508) postoperatively. Correlation analysis revealed that the prostate volume, prostate diameter and other factors included in this study were not significantly correlated to postoperative UC. CONCLUSION: The thickness of the URS is positively correlated with the recovery of early UC, the thinner the URS, the severer the UC, and so is MUL. Age is an independent risk factor for the recovery of UC at 1 month after LRP. These findings need to be further verified by more prospective studies with long-term follow-ups.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of hematological parameters for PCa with prostate-specific antigen \uff08PSA\uff09 of 4\uff0d10 \u03bcg/L and construct a risk-stratification model with these parameters. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data on the males undergoing the initial prostatic biopsy in the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University with PSA of 4\uff0d10 \u03bcg/L from March 2010 to April 2021. According to the results of biopsy, we classified the patients into a PCa and a non-PCa group, and compared the hematological parameters between the two groups. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, identified the independent risk factors for PCa, constructed a risk-stratification model for the prediction of PCa and evaluated its efficiency. RESULTS: A total of 415 cases were included in this study, 107 (25.8%) in the PCa and 308 (74.2%) in the non-PCa group. Compared with the non-PCa males, the PCa patients showed a significantly older age, higher ratios of neutrophil to lymphocyte and platelet to lymphocyte, systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), red blood cell distribution width and cystatin C (CysC) level (all P<0.05), but lower red blood cell count and hemoglobin and free/total PSA (f/tPSA) levels (all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that age, f/tPSA, SII and CysC were independent risk factors for the prediction of PCa (all P<0.05). Five prediction models were constructed based on the above risk factors, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the four-parameter (age+f/tPSA+SII+CysC) model was 0.745 (95% CI: 0.694\uff0d0.796), significantly higher than those of the other models (P<0.05). A risk-stratification model (low-, intermediate-, and high-risk) was also constructed based on the total nomogram scores, which showed a comparable performance to that of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) for the prediction of PCa (AUC: 0.727 \uff3b95% CI: 0.650\uff0d0.804\uff3d vs 0.734 \uff3b95% CI: 0.658\uff0d0.811\uff3d). However, the prediction rate by the risk-stratification model was evidently higher in the low-risk males than in those with low PI-RADS scores (1\uff0d2) (39.4% vs 22.2%). CONCLUSION: SII and CysC are independent risk factors for the prediction of PCa in patients with gray-zone PSA levels. The risk-stratification model based on age, SII, CysC and f/tPSA is comparable to PI-RADS in the diagnostic efficiency of PCa, with an even higher prediction rate in low-risk patients than in those with low PI-RADS scores, and contributive to precision screening and reduction of excessive biopsies in the diagnosis of PCa with gray-zone PSA.",

We recorded the docking time, laparoscopic surgery time, vesico-urethral anastomosis time, intraoperative blood loss and postoperative urinary continence, and compared them between the two groups. RESULTS: Operations were successfully completed in all the cases. No statistically significant differences were observed between the TMR and DVR groups in the docking time (6 min vs 5 min, P > 0.05) or intraoperative blood loss (200 ml vs 150 ml, P > 0.05).

        "AbstractText": "Mastectomy is often coupled with breast reconstruction surgery (BRS) to reconstruct the breast mound. However, BRS is challenging and subject to the judgement of the surgeon in determining the amount of tissue to be harvested and the shape of reconstructed breast. To date, the existing tools aimed at maintaining symmetry and appearance of the reconstructed breast are costly. In this paper, we have developed an intuitive breast reconstruction system comprising a software application integrated with the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, and a low-cost RGB-D camera. Our SLAM-based breast reconstruction system will be used to scan and reconstruct the patient's breast using our customized mesh-generating method prior to mastectomy. Using this reconstructed model, a patient-specific 3D printed mold is created to help shape the harvested tissue that is inserted into the mastectomy site during BRS. Validation experiments show that the mean repeatability and accuracy errors for the surface reconstruction are less than 1.5 mm. The software application has been tested on 20 patients under an IRB-approved protocol including intraoperative guidance for 4 patients. The results show the consistent and accurate reconstruction of the breasts including the inframammary fold for different breast shapes and skin tones.",

METHODS: While proven GC, IM, and healthy control(HC) patients were included, patients with the comorbid disease were excluded, and univariate analyses compared three groups. The receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve analysis was run for CBC parameters. The area under the curve(AUC) was evaluated, and a cut-off value was determined. The sensitivity and specificity of each parameter were considered. RESULTS: The GC, IM, and HC groups consisted of 72(33%), 73(34%), and 72(33%) patients, respectively. RDW, PLT, NLR, PLR, and MLR were significant between GC and IM. The highest AUC (0.727) was obtained for the PLT yielding a 56.9% sensitivity and 79.4% specificity at a cut-off value of 151.8. The AUC of RDW was found as 0.691 and 0.626 for pairwise comparisons of GC-HC and IM-HC, respectively. At a cut-off value of 13.4, PLR yielded 70.8% sensitivity and 61.1% specificity in the detection of GC, while 64.4% sensitivity and 51.1% specificity for IM. CONCLUSION: CBC parameters, such as RDW, PLT, NLR, PLR, and MLR, have value in detecting GC. RDW also has diagnostic value in helping to detect IM. PLR can help to distinguish patients with GC from those with IM. These inexpensive, easily accessible parameters may help in the timely diagnosis of GC and IM.",

Such clones lack expression of the surface molecules linked to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. The underlying defect is a somatic mutation of the short arm of the phosphatidylinositol glycan class A gene (PIG-A). CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 34-year-old male, with recurrent hemolytic anemia and dural venous sinus thrombosis found to have PNH by flow cytometry. He is currently on anticoagulation, iron and folate supplements, intermittent steroids for hemolytic episodes as we await complement inhibitors. CONCLUSION: As part of the diagnostic workup for patients presenting with recurrent hemolytic anemia and thrombosis in unusual sites, clinicians should include PNH on the list of differential diagnoses. Effort should be taken to characterize the red urine reported on the urine dipstick as blood/hemoglobin by microscopy to differentiate hematuria and hemoglobinuria and order for flow cytometry as this has implications on patient management.",

METHODOLOGY: The expressions of miR-153 and PRDM2 in NSCLC tissues and A549 cells were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). TargetScan was utilized to predict miR-153 target genes. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays were carried out to study the cell proliferation and apoptosis. Western blotting was performed to examine the changes in the proteins in the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway following the miR-153 overexpression. RESULTS: The expression of miR-153 was decreased and that of PRDM2 was increased in NSCLC tissues and cells. Target genes regulated by miR-153 participated in self-vascular development, miRNA metabolic process and the Wnt signaling pathway. The overexpression of miR-153 led to an obvious reduction in the proliferation ability of A549 cells, a notable increase in apoptotic cells, and significant decreases in phosphorylated (p)-JAK2 and p-STAT3 proteins. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that miR-153 could directly modulate the expression level of PRDM2.

Knowledge about late effects and follow-up preferences in Kenya is lacking. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed self-reported late effects in Kenyan childhood cancer survivors and explored their preferences for survivorship care. METHODS: Childhood cancer survivors, having successfully completed treatment for at least one year, were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires during clinic or home visits between 2021-2022. Medical records were reviewed for patient and treatment characteristics. RESULTS: Twenty-six survivors of hematological malignancies (n=19, 73%), solid tumors (n=6, 23%), unknown tumor type (n=1, 4%), were interviewed. Most survivors (n=19, 73%) solely received chemotherapy and one survivor (4%) was irradiated. Median time since treatment completion was seven years. Fifteen survivors (58%) were previously lost to follow-up. Many survivors (n=19; 73%) self-reported late effects, predominantly pain and fatigue. Survivors (n=11, 42%) were limited in daily life activities: physical work (n=10, 38%), personal care (n=6, 23%), social activities (n=6, 23%). Eight survivors (31%) recalled being informed about late effects. Some survivors experienced a negative attitude toward cancer in regional hospitals. Follow-up duration was longer among informed patients (p=0.043). Survivors recommended education and survivor meetings and preferred their follow-up to be done at the referral center. CONCLUSIONS: Kenyan childhood cancer survivors self-report late effects, comparable in frequency, nature and severity to other survivors worldwide. Survivors and healthcare providers require education about the lifelong impact of childhood cancer and should have access to survivorship expertise to continue follow-up.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is an obstacle facing CML patients in spite of the high cure rate. In this context, a study association between IGFBP (1, 2, 3) genes expression and their proteins in CML with the response to TKI has been implicated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 115 newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CP) followed up over 12 months under TKI. 116 apparently healthy individuals were used as a control. RT-qPCR amplification was used for detecting IGFBPs genes expression, and ELISA technique was used for measuring serum IGFBPs. RESULTS: IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 genes expression, as well as their serum levels, were significantly higher in CML patients, whereas IGFBP-2 gene expression was not. Interestingly, IGFBP-1 gene expression and IGFBP-1 serum levels were significantly higher in resistant patients compared to responder patients. However, the expression of IGFBP-2, 3 genes and their serum were insignificant. CONCLUSION: IGFBP-1 gene expression and its serum were significantly correlated with resistance. It is currently recommended that IGF-receptor inhibitors be developed and utilized. We are hoping to optimize the cure rate for CML treated with TKIs.",

This study examined the cytotoxicity and anti-inflammatory properties of a methanolic crude extract of Punica granatum L. peel (PPM) on monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PPM along with Quercetin as reference was used to assess the cytotoxic effect on THP-1 cells and describe its effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines such as COX-2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 against cancer cell line by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The percentage of viable cells significantly decreased which correlates to non-toxicity whereas quercetin was found to be highly toxic, the IC50 could not be calculated because of drug precipitation. There was a significant decrease in the expressions of inflammatory cytokines upon pre-treatment of the cells with PPM prior to LPS stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that no cytotoxicity was observed after the treatment of THP-1 cells with PPM (25-400 \u00b5g/ml), but at higher concentration (400\u00b5g/ml), the cell viability decreased to 84% and attenuated the expression level of inflammatory cytokines. The inhibitory effect of the extract on pro-inflammatory factors production may provide a theoretical source on upcoming treatment of inflammation.",

We aimed to assess the time of diagnosis among prostate cancer patients in Uganda and investigate the factors associated with early or delayed diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of 280 records of patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer from January 2016 to December 2017. Delayed diagnosis was defined as the diagnosis done at stage III or IV Stage I and II were classified as early. We used modified Poisson regression to assess factors associated with early or delayed diagnosis. RESULTS: The median from symptom recognition to diagnosis was 12 months (Interquartile Range, IQR: 5-24), with 76% of patients receiving their diagnosis more than 4 months after experiencing symptoms. Notably, 35.7% of patients were diagnosed at stage III, and 46.1% at stage IV. Upon diagnosis, all patients exhibited elevated prostate-specific antgen (PSA) levels with median PSA of 100.2 ng/ml (IQR: 36.02-350) in blood. CONCLUSION: Taking a biopsy after 4 months of initial symptoms was partially responsible for the delay in diagnosis. Communities should be educated about prostate cancer symptoms and advised to seek health care early. Health care workers should be sensitized to suspect prostate cancer among patients to allow timely referral.",

METHODS: The clinical information of 120 PCOS patients receiving treatment in our hospital from March 2019 to April 2022 were included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups, endometrial cancer (EC, n=35) and normal group (NM, n=85). Statistical analysis included t-test, c2-test, and Pearson's correlation coefficient. We analysed the data using logistic regression. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the prediction model were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and calibration curves. RESULTS: The incidence rate of EC in women with PCOS is 10.91% (12/110). Significant differences were found in waist circumference, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), visceral fat area (VFA) oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), estradiol (E2), and luteinizing hormone (LH) between the two groups (P<0.05). No statistical difference was found in age, hip circumference, menopause, use of intrauterine device, progesterone (P) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) between the groups (P>0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that BMI, HOMA-IR, VFA and HER2 were independent influencing factors of EC in PCOS patients (P<0.05). The AUC of BMI, HOMA-IR, VFA, HER2 were 0.878 (95%CI: 0.810~0.946), 0.831 (95%CI: 0.751~0.911), 0.816 (95%CI: 0.704~0.929) and 0.737 (95%CI: 0.634,0.840), respectively. The model had more diagnostic effectiveness (AUC=0.973). CONCLUSIONS: In PCOS disease, high-level BMI, HOMA-IR, VFA, and positive HER2 show an increased risk in the incidence of EC. These findings suggest that BMI, HOMA-IR, VFA, and HER2 are potential markers for Risk assessment of EC.HER2: Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, E2: estradiol, P: progesterone, LH: Luteinizing hormone, FSH: Follicle-stimulating hormone.",

        "AbstractText": "The senescence of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells is involved in osteoporosis. The combination of dasatinib and quercetin has been explored to alleviate bone loss by efficiently reducing senescent cell populations. However, senolytic therapy by dasatinib and quercetin requires a precise ratio for better therapeutic effects, which is hard to achieve by oral administration. Meanwhile, the poor water solubility of these compounds limits their bioavailability, and their non-specific action could hamper effective penetration and targeting within relevant tissues. Herein, we developed alendronate-functionalized liposomes carrying dasatinib and quercetin (Aln-Lipo-DQ), focusing mainly on senescence-associated osteoporosis induced by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Alendronate helps liposomes deliver dasatinib and quercetin to the femur and tibias, effectively removing senescent cells from bone tissue and increasing bone volume fraction from 5.05% to 11.95% in the chemotherapy-induced osteoporosis mouse model. We also found a 2.91-fold increase in bone volume fraction in Aln-Lipo-DQ treated groups compared to the control in radiotherapy models. This selectively targeting bone and reducing senescent cells holds great promise for cancer treatment-related and senescence-associated bone disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer with a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is one of the first-line clinical therapeutic strategies for HCC. Still, the effectiveness of chemotherapy is hampered by the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and drug resistance caused by insufficient delivery. Herein, we developed a metal-drug self-delivery nanomedicine (FDAH) to improve the chemo/chemodynamic therapeutic efficacy of HCC. The core of FDAH is an iron-based nanoparticle chelated with two clinical drugs, Doxorubicin (DOX) and Plerixafor (AMD3100). Additionally, the nanomedicine is externally modified with a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell, which can prolong the circulation time of the nanoparticles in the bloodstream after intravenous administration. After entering the bloodstream, the nanomedicine reaches the tumor tissue through the EPR effect and is phagocytosed by the tumor cells via HA/CD44-specific interaction. Iron ion-mediated chemodynamic therapy is mediated by the Fenton reaction to generate ROS, causing an imbalance of redox homeostasis within the tumor cells and enhancing the sensitivity of tumor cells to DOX. In addition, AMD3100 intervenes in the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis to influence the infiltration level of immune cells and promote DOX chemotherapy in tumor cells. This work suggests that alleviating immunosuppression via a metal-drug self-delivery system of the CXCR4 inhibitor can effectively improve the DOX chemotherapy and iron ions-mediated chemodynamic therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes results from recent studies that shed light on viral and cellular mechanisms that contribute to latency and persistence of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). We discuss the initial molecular events of latency establishment starting from entry of the viral genome into the nucleus to how viral genomes are properly segregated when latently infected cells undergo mitosis. Finally, we discuss the critical role of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) in orchestrating these processes. RECENT FINDINGS: Upon entering the host-cell nucleus, naked viral DNA circularizes and rapidly associates with cellular histones and the transcription machinery. This permits a burst of viral gene expression including LANA which quickly recruits chromatin remodeling complexes and modifiers to organize the viral chromatin architecture. These events restrict transcription to the latency locus and switch the lytic genes to a repressed state that is poised for reactivation. Structural studies demonstrate that LANA assembly on the viral terminal repeats leads to the formation of higher order structures that stabilize the latent viral chromatin and impact how the viral episome is segregated during cell division. SUMMARY: Understanding molecular mechanisms of latency establishment and maintenance provide insights into gammaherpesvirus biology and thus may reveal new strategies to prevent or treat KSHV-associated malignancies.",

Although acute arterial thrombosis in the cerebrovascular circulation has devastating consequences and requires immediate attention, the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) varies significantly. Our goal was to determine the molecular signatures and cellular content of thrombus extracted using a catheter to gain insight into vascular remodeling. Twenty-five patients underwent catheter-directed thrombectomy (CDT); 13 for cerebrovascular accident (CVA), 8 for pulmonary embolism, and 4 for deep vein thrombosis. Protein and RNA were extracted from thrombi to enable immunoblotting, RNA sequencing, and quantification of gene expression. The time from symptom onset to thrombus extraction was 7.7\u00a0\u00b1 1.9 hours for CVA and 109\u00a0\u00b1 55 hours for VTE. Protein concentration, white blood cell content (monocytes), and red blood cell content were greater in venous thrombus than in arterial thrombus, whereas the platelet content was similar. Both venous and arterial thrombi contained several zinc endopeptidases belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. MMP9 activity in venous thrombus was greater than arterial thrombus (61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0ng/mL per \u03bcg protein vs 25\u00a0\u00b1 6\u00a0ng/mL per \u03bcg protein; P\u00a0=\u00a0.005). Arterial and venous thrombi displayed surprisingly different phenotypes, with biologically active enzymes promoting blood vessel remodeling and enzymatic activity proportional to thrombus age extracted from the veins. These mechanistic data may support the role of early CDT in venous circulation to avoid irreversible vascular remodeling.",

        "AbstractText": "The relationship between fibrinolysis, inflammation, and prothrombotic risk among children hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related illness is ill defined. To investigate the association between plasma fibrinolytic capacity and proinflammatory cytokine concentrations among children hospitalized for primary COVID-19 infection and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), we hypothesized that cytokine concentrations differ by clinical phenotype and are associated with hypofibrinolysis. We analyzed banked plasma specimens serially collected from children aged <18 years admitted for primary COVID-19 or MIS-C and enrolled in the COVID-19 Anticoagulation in Children-Thromboprophylaxis multicenter trial, an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial conducted between July 2020 and May 2021. Plasma coagulative and fibrinolytic function were measured via the clot formation and lysis (CloFAL) assay and modified mini-euglobulin clot lysis assay (ECLA). Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 were measured by the Meso Scale Discovery assay. Correlations were evaluated using Spearman rank testing. A total of 132 banked plasma specimens from 38 participants (COVID-19: n\u00a0=\u00a018; MIS-C: n\u00a0=\u00a020) were analyzed. Overall, increased coagulative function (ie, elevated CloFAL area under the curve) and impaired fibrinolytic function (ie, reduced CloFAL fibrinolytic index [FI] and elevated modified mini-ECLA clot lysis time ratio [CLTR]) were observed but most notably among those with MIS-C. Plasma cytokine concentrations correlated with assay indices of hypofibrinolysis (ie, modified mini-ECLA CLTR and CloFAL FI). In summary, among children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illness, hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis are mediated, in part, by inflammation that may contribute to prothrombotic risk.

        "AbstractText": "Myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL), also known as thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor, is a class I cytokine receptor that is expressed on hematopoietic progenitors, promoting growth and differentiation toward the megakaryocyte lineage and is critical for normal platelet production. Mutations in MPL, TPO, or Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) have been implicated in multiple diseases from congenital thrombocytopenias to myeloproliferative neoplasms. The ligand for MPL, TPO, stimulates platelet production by inducing MPL dimerization and results in an active conformation that allows downstream JAK2/STAT5 signaling. Despite the biological importance of this pathway, the molecular signaling mechanism remained unclear. Here, we present a 3.39-\u00c5 cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ectodomain of mouse MPL bound to TPO. The structure revealed both low and high affinity sites between MPL and TPO that contain several pathologic mutations. To better understand TPO-driven MPL signaling, we expanded upon this structure by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to model the full-length human MPL/TPO complex, and showed that MPL D4-D4 domain interactions are functionally relevant in activity assays. To build on our understanding of downstream activation, we added JAK2 to the MPL/TPO complex by MD simulations. This ternary complex illustrates JAK2 dimerization through the pseudokinase domain, illustrates residues important for MPL interactions, and reveals the constitutive activation mechanism of patient mutant V617F. The model also suggests the mechanism of JAK2 tyrosine kinase domain transphosphorylation. Overall, our studies illuminate TPO/MPL/JAK2 signaling mechanisms and provide additional insight into the nature of receptor signaling, which will further benefit human health.",

However, fibrinogen supplementation has not shown a benefit in trauma patients with coagulopathy. The von Clauss functional fibrinogen assay is the primary indication for fibrinogen transfusion. This assay, however, infers fibrinogen levels optically via in\u00a0vitro clot formation time and does not directly measure the quantity or quality of plasma fibrinogen. We hypothesized that the Clauss fibrinogen activity assay does not accurately reflect true fibrinogen levels in severely injured patients. Here, we demonstrate normal baseline plasma fibrinogen levels as measured by mass spectrometry despite coagulopathic Clauss values in severely injured patients. This discrepancy is most significant in patients with coagulopathy (international normalized ratio of >1.3) or with high shock, and persists even after fibrinogen repletion. These data highlight the need to reevaluate clinical testing of fibrinogen activity and transfusion criteria for the critically injured, and indicate that correcting shock and the oxidative, inflammatory milieu of trauma may be more effective at improving fibrinogen activity.

In this study, a modified solvent-dialysis approach was used to encapsulate DOX and BER with hyaluronic acid (HA) and chitosan (CS). The formulation was characterized by size, zeta potential, morphology and FT-IR. In vitro studies evaluated encapsulation efficiency, cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and disruption of CSC-enriched mammospheres. In vivo experiments assessed tumor-targeting efficacy, antitumor activity, and safety in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse model. Consequently, (DOX\u00a0+\u00a0BER) NPs promoted tumor accumulation, reduced systemic toxicity, and advanced treatment in TNBC. Targeted distribution to CD44-positive CSCs and TNBC cells reduced CSC viability and PD-L1 expression. Investigations demonstrated that (DOX\u00a0+\u00a0BER) NPs superior to free DOX. These findings suggest that the HA-CS nanoparticle delivery system for DOX and BER co-administration may help to treat TNBC by eliminating CSCs and downregulating PD-L1.

A pathological, oligosymptomatic fracture associated with epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE), a rare endothelial cell-derived sarcoma, is uncommon. Case Presentation: A 44-year-old patient underwent biopsy procedures three times (2010, 2012, 2013) for a focal lesion of the left ischium, none confirming its malignant nature. The last biopsy revealed a neoplastic tissue with features of discrete dysplasia. The lesion did not undergo medical follow-up for seven consecutive years. In August 2020, the patient presented with right lower limb pain. A CT scan, PET/CT scan, and biopsy confirmed EHE with spindle/sarcomatous features. In November 2020, chemotherapy (5xADIC) started (PET/CT confirmed a partial response). After its completion in July 2021, bone progression occurred and sirolimus-based therapy was started. After 3 months, a small liver metastasis was visualized on PET/CT, which did not result in the termination of treatment. In December 2021, pamidronate-based antiresorptive therapy was started. Liver metastasis remained stable in follow-up CT scans. Due to pelvic and spinal lesions, the patient was assisted by elbow crutches and underwent radiotherapy, remaining professionally active.

To describe patients with diaphragmatic paralysis in a pharmacovigilance registry, we searched the prospective REISAMIC registry at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center (Villejuif, France) for cases of diaphragmatic palsy (DP) occurring from September 2014 to December 2021. Case Presentation: We identified three patients, in whom DP was confirmed by diaphragmatic ultrasonography, pulmonary function tests, and/or diaphragmatic electroneuromyogram. Diaphragmatic palsy was life-threatening in all patients, as it caused respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. In all cases, a pre-existing subclinical paraneoplastic syndrome was detected. Onconeural antibodies (anti-titin and anti-VGCC) were detected in these patients before and after the initiation of ICI therapy, suggesting a mixed paraneoplastic syndrome with features overlapping those of myasthenic syndrome (myasthenia gravis in one patient and Lambert-Eaton syndrome in another) and myositis. Conclusions: Diaphragmatic palsy is a severe irAE potentially resulting from different mechanisms, including myositis and neuromuscular junction involvement (myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton). Antineuronal antibodies associated with such conditions were already present in our patients prior to immunotherapy initiation, suggesting ICIs could trigger flare-ups of pre-existing silent paraneoplastic autoimmune conditions.",

Transfer Learning (TL) addresses this challenge by leveraging the information of other patients with the same disease (i.e., the source domain) when building a personalized model for each patient (i.e., the target domain). We propose Weakly-Supervised Transfer Learning (WS-TL) to tackle two challenges that existing TL algorithms do not address well: (i) the target domain has only a few or even no labeled samples; (ii) how to integrate domain knowledge into the TL design. We design a novel mathematical framework of WS-TL to learn a model for the target domain based on paired samples whose order relationships are inferred from domain knowledge, while at the same time integrating labeled samples in the source domain for transfer learning. Also, we propose an efficient active sampling strategy to select informative paired samples. Theoretical properties were investigated. Finally, we present a real-world application in precision medicine of brain cancer, where WS-TL is used to build personalized patient models to predict Tumor Cell Density (TCD) distribution across the brain based on MRI images. WS-TL has the highest accuracy compared to a variety of existing TL algorithms. The predicted TCD map for each patient can help facilitate individually optimized treatment.",

Existing methods for assessing treatment effect heterogeneity across regions have ignored the incomparability of baseline extrinsic risk factors of the randomized patients from different regions. In this paper, a calibration weighting method is proposed to calibrate the distribution of these extrinsic risk factors between multiple regions. We establish the consistency and the asymptotic normality of the calibration weighting estimator. Simulation studies confirm the finite sample properties of the proposed estimator as well as its superior performance over naive methods and the inverse probability weighting method. The proposed method is illustrated using a randomized clinical trial of adjuvant chemotherapy for resected non-small-cell lung cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Ovarian cancer is a prevalent gynecological malignancy with high mortality and low survival rates. The absence of specific symptoms in early stages often leads to late-stage diagnoses. Standard treatment typically includes surgery followed by platinum and paclitaxel chemotherapy. Exosomes, nanoscale vesicles released by various cell types, are key in intercellular communication, carrying biologically active molecules like proteins, lipids, enzymes, mRNA, and miRNAs. They are involved in tumor microenvironment remodeling, angiogenesis, metastasis, and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. Emerging research highlights exosomes as drug carriers and therapeutic targets to suppress anti-tumor immune responses. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enables multiplexed, sensitive, and rapid detection of exosome surface proteins, offering advantages such as low background noise, no photobleaching, robustness, and high sensitivity over other detection methods. This review explores the relationship between exosomes and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer, examining the mechanisms by which exosomes contribute to drug resistance and their clinical implications. The goal is to provide new insights into chemoresistance mechanisms, improve diagnosis and intervention strategies, and enhance chemotherapy sensitivity in clinical treatments. In addition, the prospects of exosomes as drug carriers to resist chemical resistance and improve the survival of ovarian cancer patients are summarized. This article emphasizes the role of SERS in detecting ovarian cancer exosomes and advances in exosome detection.",

This data, for instance, can help address the lower than 50% response rates to cancer immunotherapy.

Here, we present a fully wireless image sensor featuring a 2.5\u00d75 mm2 CMOS integrated circuit for multicolor fluorescence imaging deep in tissue.

In-situ fluorescence excitation is provided by microlaser diodes controlled with a programmable on-chip driver. An optical frontend combining a multi-bandpass interference filter and a fiber optic plate provides >6 OD excitation blocking and enables three-color imaging for detecting multiple cell types. A 36\u00d740-pixel array captures images with < 125  \u03bc m resolution.

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal blood neoplasm with dismal prognosis. Despite the introduction of many novel targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy has remained the standard of care for AML. Differences in mitochondrial metabolism between normal and leukemic cells can be targeted by novel AML therapies, but these agents require a comprehensive efficacy and cytotoxicity evaluation. RECENT FINDINGS: Metabolic alterations in AML blasts increase their sensitivity to therapies targeting mitochondrial metabolism. Targeting altered mitochondrial metabolism, that is crucial for leukemia cell growth and survival, could be a breakthrough in AML treatment. Therefore, BH3 family proteins, mitochondrial complexes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid (AA) and fatty acid metabolism are common treatment targets in AML. Although many drugs targeting these vulnerabilities showed acceptable safety profiles and promising efficacy in preclinical studies, clinical trials often do not confirm these results limited by narrow therapeutic window. The most effective regimens are based on drug combinations with synergistic or additive activity. SUMMARY: In this review, we present an overview of the most recent studies targeting mitochondrial metabolism in AML. We highlight that targeting of the specific energy metabolism dependencies of AML blasts provides an opportunity to achieve long-term responses with a reasonable safety profile. We emphasize that currently used drugs and their combinations display dose-limiting toxicities or are not efficient enough to completely eradicate leukemic stem cells. Thus, further studies of complex metabolic rewiring of leukemia cells before and after combinatorial therapies are warranted.",

We conducted BCC screening in April 2021, focusing on the presence or absence of multiple lesions. Patients examined between April 2021 and March 2022 (161 lesions in 136 patients) were classified as the screening group (SG) and those examined between April 2020 and March 2021 (111 lesions in 103 patients) were classified as the non-screening group (NSG). The proportion of patients with multiple BCCs was significantly higher in the SG than in the NSG (15.4% and 6.8%, p = 0.04). We provisionally classified the head and neck gaze region into the 'central region' and 'peripheral region' based on gaze patterns. In the SG, the proportion of lesions in the peripheral region was higher in patients with multiple BCCs (32.6%) than in patients with a solitary BCC (14.8%). We speculate that we missed recognizing tumours in different areas, especially peripheral areas of the head and neck. Our results indicate that the increase in multiple lesion cases through screening occurred owing to more conscious observation of different regions, especially head and neck regions, thereby overcoming human gaze patterns.",

        "AbstractText": "Acquisition of a telomere maintenance mechanism is essential for cancer cells. In a minority of tumors, telomeres are lengthened via Alternative Maintenance of Telomeres (ALT), a telomerase-independent pathway based on homologous recombination. ALT tumors have heavily rearranged genomes with many structural variants containing telomere repeats. To better understand the genetic evolution of these tumors, we seek to determine if certain genomic loci tend to spatially associate with telomeres in ALT and are especially liable to experience telomere recombination events as a result. Assays that reveal close spatial associations between genomic loci, such as SPRITE and Hi-C, have enabled extensive exploration of genomic spatial organization. However, as analysis pipelines for these next-generation sequencing-based assays typically discard reads aligning to repetitive elements, little is known about the spatial arrangement of telomeres and other repetitive loci in the nucleus. Here, we present TelSPRITE, a novel approach to extracting telomere contact frequencies from SPRITE data. We identify reads containing telomere repeats and sort them into a single bin, quantifying spatial contacts between the telomere bin and the rest of the genome. Our analysis reveals a strong dependency of telomere contact frequency on chromosomal distance from the telomere, consistent with the known effect of linear distance on 3-dimensional spatial contacts. Telomere contacts are also strongly enriched near centromeres, a phenomenon that may be reflective of spatial clustering of heterochromatic regions. ALT cell lines are globally enriched for telomere content and display distinctive intrachromosomal spikes in telomere contact frequency. Our customized analysis of long read sequencing data suggests that loci with high telomere contact frequencies represent structural variants containing telomere repeats in ALT cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate general principles of telomeric spatial organization while also profiling the spectrum of genomic rearrangements in ALT cells.",

        "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: Witnessing suffering and death in palliative care can cause moral distress, emotional exhaustion and maladaptive coping strategies. How sense and meaning is made from these experiences influences how physicians think, feel and act as professionals (professional identity formation or PIF). It also determines how they cope with their roles, care for patients and interact with other professionals. Timely, personalised and appropriate support is key as shaping how these physicians develop and contend with sometimes competing beliefs and roles. The Ring Theory of Personhood (RToP) and the Krishna-Pisupati Model (KPM) offer a means of mapping PIF and thus moulding, coping and meaning making. This study uses the RToP and KPM to explore how caring for end-of-life patients impacts the personhood of palliative care physicians. Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 13 palliative care physicians-eleven females and two males aged between 35 and 50\u00a0years-at a cancer specialist centre were conducted. Transcripts of the audio-recorded interviews underwent content and thematic analysis where complementary themes and categories identified were combined to form domains that highlighted the physicians' key experience of providing end-of-life care. The domains identified were (1) identity formation, (2) conflicts, (3) KPM elements and (4) support systems. Together, results revealed that palliative care physicians are driven by Innate, Individual, Relational and Societal belief systems that create an intertwined professional and personal identity, enabling them to find meaning in their experiences and adapt to present contexts within cultural norms and professional expectations. However, their failure to recognise their need for support when hampered by evolving personal, existential and clinical factors underlines the exigency for ongoing surveillance and a potential role for a RToP-based tool and portfolio system that can detect and direct timely, appropriate support to in-need physicians.

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Trastuzumab and anthracyclines are mainstays of chemotherapy in breast cancer and lymphoma patients but may cause significant cardiotoxicity, which may result in alterations to chemotherapy dose, schedule, or agent. Obesity is increasingly prevalent in the United States and is a significant risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. We aimed to assess the relationship between obesity and the risk of developing chemotherapy-associated cardiotoxicity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients who received trastuzumab or anthracyclines over a 5-year period from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012 at our tertiary care center in the Northeastern United States. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30 kg/m2. Cardiotoxicity was defined as demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50% or demonstrated ischemia or infarction on echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization. Bivariate analyses were conducted to determine the association between demographic and clinical variables with cardiotoxicity status. Two multivariate logistic regression models were generated to assess whether BMI was independently associated with cardiotoxicity. RESULTS: Of the 368 patients receiving either trastuzumab or anthracyclines, 16 patients developed cardiotoxicity. Demographically, age, race, BMI, body surface area (BSA), and overall weight did not differ between the patients who developed cardiotoxicity and those who did not. The mean dose of anthracycline and trastuzumab did not differ between the patients who developed cardiotoxicity and those who did not. Obesity was not found to increase the odds of developing cardiotoxicity and was slightly protective. A non-significant decrease in the odds of developing cardiotoxicity was found for every one-unit increase in BMI. In a multivariable model using BMI as a continuous predictor and controlling for BMI, age, hypertension, chemotherapy type, and coronary artery disease, the only significant predictor of cardiotoxicity was a previous history of arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity was not a significant risk factor for patients developing cardiotoxicity from trastuzumab- or anthracycline-based chemotherapy and may be a protective factor for cardiotoxicity. Additional studies with greater statistical power are needed to further evaluate this effect and independently evaluate obesity as a risk factor for cardiotoxicity.",

The diagnosis of malignant tumors at an early stage is necessary to provide treatment for patients. The patient's prognosis will improve if it is detected early. Medical experts use a manual method of segmentation when making a diagnosis of brain tumors. This study proposes a new approach to simplify and automate this process. In recent research, multi-level segmentation has been widely used in medical image analysis, and the effectiveness and precision of the segmentation method are directly tied to the number of segments used. However, choosing the appropriate number of segments is often left up to the user and is challenging for many segmentation algorithms. The proposed method is a modified version of the 3D Histogram-based segmentation method, which can automatically determine an appropriate number of segments. The general algorithm contains three main steps: The first step is to use a Gaussian filter to smooth the 3D RGB histogram of an image. This eliminates unreliable and non-dominating histogram peaks that are too close together. Next, a multimodal particle swarm optimization method identifies the histogram's peaks. In the end, pixels are placed in the cluster that best fits their characteristics based on the non-Euclidean distance. The proposed algorithm has been applied to a Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and brain MRI Images for brain Tumor detection dataset. The results of the proposed method are compared with those of three clustering methods: FCM, FCM_FWCW, and FCM_FW. In the comparative analysis of the three algorithms across various MRI slices. Our algorithm consistently demonstrates superior performance. It achieves the top mean rank in all three metrics, indicating its robustness and effectiveness in clustering.

        "AbstractText": "With advances in high-throughput technology, molecular disease subtyping by high-dimensional omics data has been recognized as an effective approach for identifying subtypes of complex diseases with distinct disease mechanisms and prognoses. Conventional cluster analysis takes omics data as input and generates patient clusters with similar gene expression pattern. The omics data, however, usually contain multi-faceted cluster structures that can be defined by different sets of gene. If the gene set associated with irrelevant clinical variables (e.g., sex or age) dominates the clustering process, the resulting clusters may not capture clinically meaningful disease subtypes. This motivates the development of a clustering framework with guidance from a pre-specified disease outcome, such as lung function measurement or survival, in this paper. We propose two disease subtyping methods by omics data with outcome guidance using a generative model or a weighted joint likelihood. Both methods connect an outcome association model and a disease subtyping model by a latent variable of cluster labels. Compared to the generative model, weighted joint likelihood contains a data-driven weight parameter to balance the likelihood contributions from outcome association and gene cluster separation, which improves generalizability in independent validation but requires heavier computing. Extensive simulations and two real applications in lung disease and triple-negative breast cancer demonstrate superior disease subtyping performance of the outcome-guided clustering methods in terms of disease subtyping accuracy, gene selection and outcome association. Unlike existing clustering methods, the outcome-guided disease subtyping framework creates a new precision medicine paradigm to directly identify patient subgroups with clinical association.",

Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an innovative antitumor approach that can be combined with chemotherapy to achieve potent synergistic effects. Mesoporous silica nanomaterials (MSNs) are ideal drug delivery vehicles in cancer therapy due to their unique advantages. This study presents an effective and straightforward strategy to design an intelligent drug delivery system (DDS) activated by the tumor-specific weakly acidic microenvironment to achieve efficient cancer treatment. By incorporating the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) and divalent iron (Fe2+) into the unique mesoporous channels of MSNs, we fabricated MSNs@Fe2+@DOX. Under weakly acidic pH conditions, the functional components Fe2+ and DOX of MSNs@Fe2+@DOX are gradually released at the tumor site. The released Fe2+ can then consume hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumor cells, increasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxides through the Fenton reaction, thereby inducing ferroptosis. The combination of DOX-induced apoptosis and ferroptosis results in further enhanced cancer treatment. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that MSNs@Fe2+@DOX had an excellent therapeutic effect on breast cancer cells and tumor-bearing nude mice. We anticipate that this study will provide a promising biotechnological platform for combined breast cancer treatment by inducing CDT and chemotherapy.",

        "ArticleTitle": "B-cell editing: An emerging alternative of precision oncotherapy.",
        "AbstractText": "Lately, the urgency of precision medicine in cancer care through immunotherapy has reformed the arena of oncology. Although immunomodulatory therapeutics in cancer have been preliminarily concentrated on T-cells, emerging evidences have suggested that intra-tumoral B-cells and plasma cells have significant contributions in cancer prognosis primarily through the production of antibodies. B-cell oriented cancer vaccines have been used in early clinical trials of breast and other cancers after multiple preclinical studies. Passive immunotherapy via administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and emergence of anti-idiotypic antibodies have led to considerable advancement in oncotherapy. Endogenous production of mAbs would be of significant benefit in recurrent or residual malignancies and permanent infusion would help in the overcoming of issues related to pharmacodynamic variations observed in case of intravenous inoculations of bi or tri specific mAbs. This has directed towards the development of genome reprogrammed B-cells with the capability of yielding therapeutic mAbs independently. Genetic alteration through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) nucleases have enabled the introduction of transgenes into B-cell genome thereby stimulating the plasma cells to produce exogenous remedial antibodies. It also facilitates ex vivo B-cell editing to elevate specificities of antigen receptors and generate target specific antibody responses which cannot normally be evoked in patient's immune system. Hence, genome-altered B-cells possess the potential of engineered therapeutics against certain malignancies. Co-operation of B-cells in T-cell based vaccines are ultimate need for vaccine success. In this chapter, the mechanisms, challenges and potential advantages of B-cell editing in cancer immune therapy shall be explored. The prospects of B-cell editing in onco-therapy will be clearly elucidated with all its strength and weaknesses.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Safety and Effectiveness of Percutaneous Ethanol Injection as a Treatment for Locally Recurrent Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Reoperation for recurrent papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is associated with a high risk of complications and limited success in achieving sustained remission. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) presents a potential non-surgical alternative for managing locally recurrent PTC. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PEI in treating recurrent PTC. METHODS: From October 2017 to September 2021, PEI was administered to 39 recurrent lesions (23 lateral and 16 central) in 17 patients with PTC. The median follow-up duration was 21.4 months (range, 4.1 - 37.9), with ethanol injections delivered every 3 months under ultrasound (US) guidance as needed. RESULTS: Most patients tolerated the treatment well, experiencing only mild local pain, though one patient reported Horner syndrome following the procedure. In terms of treatment frequency, 31 lesions required 3 or fewer injections, while the remaining lesions required more. The mean initial volume of the lesions decreased from 0.12 mm\u00b3 (range: 0.06 - 0.34 mm\u00b3) to 0.03 mm\u00b3 (range: 0.0 - 0.14 mm\u00b3), representing an average reduction of 72.6% (range: 20.0 - 100.0%). Of the 39 lymph nodes treated in 17 patients, 21 lymph nodes (54%) were completely resolved. Seven lymph nodes remain under ongoing ethanol treatment, while 11 lymph nodes in 4 patients were addressed with alternative treatments, including surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous ethanol injection appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for managing locally recurrent thyroid carcinomas in select patients. However, further comparative, prospective, long-term studies are needed to evaluate PEI's impact on patient survival and recurrence rates.",

        "AbstractText": "Staphylococcus aureus, a versatile human pathogen, significantly impacts global health causing a broad spectrum of medical conditions that range from minor skin infections to life-threatening diseases. The clinical importance of S. aureus is underscored by its resistance to multiple antibiotics and formation of biofilms, providing protection against antimicrobials and immune responses. To date, the identification of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) S. aureus strains, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), requires time-consuming and expensive methodologies, including culture-based, molecular, and phenotypic techniques. Previously, we developed a paper-based ratiometric sensor array composed of fluorescent sensor dyes (3-hydroxyflavone derivatives) pre-adsorbed on paper microzone plates. Combined with machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, this sensor effectively discriminated 16 bacterial species and determined their Gram status. In this study, we evaluate its ability to distinguish antibiotic-resistant S. aureus strains and their biofilms. Our results demonstrate that the sensor array, in conjunction with LDA and neural networks, successfully differentiated three common laboratory MRSA strains from three methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains with 82.5% accuracy. Furthermore, using support vector machines, this sensor was able to distinguish and categorically classify MRSA, MSSA, and VISA clinical isolates with 97.5% accuracy. Remarkably, beyond distinguishing planktonic cultures, this sensor array demonstrated a formidable capability to discriminate AMR S. aureus biofilms, achieving over 80% accuracy. Combined, the results of this study highlight the paper-based sensor array's significant potential as a robust diagnostic tool to accurately, rapidly, and easily identify drug-resistant S. aureus strains in clinically relevant settings.",

        "ArticleTitle": "SCGAN: Sparse CounterGAN for Counterfactual Explanations in Breast Cancer Prediction.",
        "AbstractText": "Imaging phenotypes extracted via radiomics of magnetic resonance imaging have shown great potential in predicting the treatment response in breast cancer patients after administering neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). Understanding the causal relationships between the treatment response and Imaging phenotypes, Clinical information, and Molecular (ICM) features are critical in guiding treatment strategies and management plans. Counterfactual explanations provide an interpretable approach to generating causal inference. However, existing approaches are either computationally prohibitive for high dimensional problems, generate unrealistic counterfactuals, or confound the effects of causal features by changing multiple features simultaneously. This paper proposes a new method called Sparse CounteRGAN (SCGAN) for generating counterfactual instances to reveal causal relationships between ICM features and the treatment response after NST. The generative approach learns the distribution of the original instances and, therefore, ensures that the new instances are realistic. We propose dropout training of the discriminator to promote sparsity and introduce a diversity term in the loss function to maximize the distances among generated counterfactuals. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available datasets, followed by the breast cancer dataset, and compare their performance with existing methods in the literature. Results show that SCGAN generates sparse and diverse counterfactual instances that also achieve plausibility and feasibility, making it a valuable tool for understanding the causal relationships between ICM features and treatment response.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Association between Thyroid Profile Levels and Lymph Node Metastasis in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: A Retrospective Study.",
        "AbstractText": "Background: Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine carcinoma, accounting for 3.26% of all cancers. The most histologically, well-differentiated thyroid cancer is papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Although PTC is regarded as an indolent tumor, a portion of the cancer cells metastasize to lymph nodes around the thyroid gland. Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a critical risk factor for tumor recurrence in PTC, which strongly affects disease prognosis and the quality of life. Methods: This study aims to examine how differences in the level of the thyroid profile and other risk factors may influence LNM incidence in patients with PTC in Taiwan. We carried out a single-center retrospective study. These PTC patients were retrospectively reviewed by the Department of Endocrinology from 2016 to 2019. A total of 165 patients were included in our research. Results: The findings revealed a close relationship with the level of free thyroxine (FT4), the level of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and lymph node metastases. The correlation in terms of FT4 (p = 0.005) and TSH (p = 0.417) with LNM was found as a result of the univariate regression analysis. In the multiple regression analysis, the findings revealed a close relationship between LNM, FT4 (p < 0.001), and TSH (p = 0.008). Conclusions: Although the predictability of the TSH should be examined further, the association between LNM and FT4 or TSH should not be ignored. The results could help guide decision-making and patient counseling, using the level of serum FT4 or the TSH as a possible predictive factor of the LNM in PTC.",

        "AbstractText": "Oral lichen planus is a frequent, chronic autoimmune disease that affects the oral mucosa and is characterized as an oral potentially malignant disorder. The aim of our study is to examine the presence of CSCs bearing CD147 (a marker related to local inflammation and associated with various cancers) through immunohistochemistry in oral lichen planus (OLP) compared to oral leukoplakia (OL) and healthy tissues. These findings could contribute to clinical practice by providing a marker for the prognostic assessment of OLP lesions with regards to their potentially malignant nature. The study sample consisted of paraffin-embedded oral mucosa specimens from the archives of the Department of Oral Medicine/Pathology, School of Dentistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece during the period 2009-2019. The study sample contained 24 cases of OLP (14 erosive and 10 reticular) and 30 cases of oral leukoplakia, which were compared to 5 normal oral epithelium samples derived from healthy epithelium adjacent to fibromas from other cases. Cell membrane staining of CD147 was observed mostly in the basal and parabasal cell layer. The statistically significantly higher expression of CD147 in the erosive lichen planus subgroup than in the moderately and severely dysplastic leukoplakia subgroup (p = 0.01) constituted the most important finding of this study. The characteristic expression of CD147 in erosive OLP suggests the presence of epithelial cells with CSC characteristics, but its lower expression in oral leukoplakias suggests a more intense relation of the CD147 marker with inflammation rather than with oral dysplastic progression.",

        "AbstractText": "In Mexico, breast cancer (BC) is the principal cause of death in women over 30 years old, with an annual mortality rate of 14.61 deaths per a 100,000 population. Chemotherapy, in combination with trastuzumab (TTZ), improves the survival of cancer patients; however, cardiotoxicity (CT) is the principal consequence. CT prevalence occurs between 10% and 30% of patients; however, there are no data about the prevalence of CT in the Mexican population. This study aims to establish the prevalence of CT in patients treated with anti-HER-2 therapy among BC women in southeast Mexico. A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out from January 2015 to July 2019. The records of 46 patients diagnosed with HER-2-positive BC who attended the Mexican Social Security Institute in the Ambulatory Care Medicine Unit were analyzed. The diagnostic criterion for CT was a decrease in LVEF > 10% from baseline or a final LVEF < 53%. CT prevalence was observed in 19 (41.3%) of women with cancer, with an average decrease in LVEF of 13%. In the population, we found an association between weight, surface area, and the loading dose of TTZ with CT. Nutritional follow-up and the administration of cardioprotective drugs are necessary to recover LVEF and avoid cardiovascular failure in women with BC and survivors.",

While a Pap smear remains a reliable method for early detection, identifying new biomarkers to stratify the risk is crucial. For this purpose, extensive research has been conducted on detecting DNA methylation. (2) Methods: This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the expression levels of EIF4G3 and SF3B1 in precursor lesions and cervical tumor tissues through qRT-PCR and evaluate the methylation status of their promoters through bisulfite conversion. (3) Results: Both genes showed similar mRNA expression patterns, with the highest levels observed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples (p < 0.0001). Additionally, methylation analysis indicated increased percentages in the control group for both factors. Notably, the expression levels of both genes were inversely correlated with promoter methylation (EIF4G3-p = 0.0016; SF3B1-p < 0.0001). (4) Conclusions: Regarding the methylation pattern for both genes, we observe a decreasing trend from NILM to SCC patients. Therefore, we concluded that the decrease in methylation at the promoter level for both genes could be an indicator of abnormal cytology.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men. Secondary nephrotic syndrome, a feature of paraneoplastic syndrome, occurs in 11% of cases and is mainly caused by membranous glomerulopathy. The association between minimal change disease and prostate cancer is rare. Only one cause has been described in the available literature. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 77-year-old patient who was admitted to our department with stage 3 acute kidney injury and with nephrotic syndrome with anasarca (creatinine: 168 \u00b5mol/L, eGFR: 33 mL/min/1.73 m2, albumin: 18.5 g/L, total cholesterol: 6.86 mmol/L, urine albumin creatinine ratio: 812.7 mg/mmol). In the differential diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, looking for a secondary cause is essential, so the parainfectious causes of nephrotic syndrome were excluded. An elevated prostate-specific antigen (10.69 ng/L) was found when screening for oncological causes, and prostate adenocarcinoma was identified on biopsy. A renal biopsy was then performed with a finding of minimal change disease. Despite the generally accepted guidelines of prostate carcinoma in that stage and age of the patient being watchful waiting, antiandrogen therapy was started with the cooperation of a urologist. There was a significant improvement in renal parameters in the patient (creatinine: 87 \u00b5mol/L, eGFR: 73 mL/min/1.73 m2, albumin: 33.4 g/L, urine albumin creatinine ratio: 27.6 mg/mmol). CONCLUSION: This case shows the importance of multidisciplinary cooperation in the treatment of secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome. In the case of proven paraneoplastic syndrome, it is necessary to start treating the malignancy; however, in general, a conservative approach without treatment is recommended.",

        "AbstractText": "Carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA) is a routine marker employed for follow-up of colorectal tumors. We aimed to determine whether a CEA increase within the normal range can be linked to a risk of recurrence. From the period of 2006-2013 we selected 78 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer, who underwent curative surgery with or without neo-/adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy and had proper follow-up procedures. For analyzing CEA fluctuation, we used the smallest value of the CEA during follow-up as the reference. With the aid of a Chi-squared test, we have chosen the value of 1.1 ng/mL for significant CEA fluctuation. A total of 43.6% of patients had fluctuations in CEA of at least 1.1 ng/mL, with or without increases above 5 ng/mL. From these, in 79.4% of patients, the increases in CEA were explained either by recurrence (44.1%), adjuvant chemotherapy (20.6%) or benign pathology (14.7%). In 23% of the recurrences, a CEA increase of at least 1.1 ng/mL, but below 5 ng/mL, preceded the clinical relapse by a median of 8 months. Our conclusion is that an increase in CEA levels by at least 1.1 ng/mL within the normal range after curative treatment for colorectal cancer may serve as an early indicator of relapse or could be associated with other pathological conditions.",

These are generally encountered in the neck, head, and flexor areas of the extremities. Even though many schwannomas are easily diagnosable, their variable morphology can occasionally create difficulty in diagnosis. In this study, we present a rare case of melanotic schwannoma of the sacrum, emphasizing the need for routine biopsy to understand the etiology. A 46-year-old man presented to the Department of Neurosurgery, Taipei Medical University Hospital, with buttock pain in the sacrum area for 1 year, which worsened in the last 1-2 months. The patient had no known history of trauma or malignancy. We evidenced an intradural extramedullary neurogenic tumor at the caudal end from S1 to S3. Histologic analysis revealed melanin deposition in the tumor cells. Round to oval tumor cells were positive for HMB-45 and S-100 proteins, suggestive of melanotic Schwannoma, which were removed by laminectomy. After 1 month, the tumor recurred and was further removed surgically. Conclusively, we observed the sacrum as an unusual anatomic site for the possible occurrence of melanotic schwannoma, especially in patients with no known history of trauma and malignancy. The possibility of melanotic schwannoma is very high. We hypothesize that melanotic schwannoma was possible because it occurred in the intradural and extramedullary regions of the spine. Hence, a routine biopsy should be performed to corroborate the exact cause and prevent incorrect presumptions.",

        "AbstractText": "Background and Clinical Significance: Head and neck teratomas are embryonal tumors that develop when totipotent germ cells escape the developmental control of primary organizers and form a more-or-less organoid mass in which tissues from all three germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) can be identified. Mature teratomas may either transit into germ cell or non-germ cell malignancies or remain histologically mature with the possibility of growing, thus inducing certain complications when reaching a large size. This article aims to investigate a very rare case of a 6-year-old child who exhibited a recurrent intraoral mass with multiple conflicting biopsies. Case Presentation: A 6-year-old male patient was referred to the postgraduate clinic of the Department of Oral Medicine/Pathology, Dental School, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, because his pediatric dentist noticed an exophytic, intraoral mass, distal to tooth #75 during a routine checkup. The first histopathological examination showed a gingival tumor, classified as a small round blue cell tumor, with greater similarity to adamantinoma-like Ewing sarcoma (ALES) and less to synovial sarcoma. The second pathologist examined the same tissue specimen and suggested the extremely rare presence of an immature malignant teratoma. Following chemotherapy, the rest of the teratoma with the adjacent tooth #75 was removed, and the histopathological examination showed a mature teratoma. Conclusions: This case illustrates the crucial role of the dentist, and in this case of the pediatric dentist, to promptly diagnose the underlying disease. Genetic screening may assist in detecting high-risk populations. In such complex histopathological cases, the importance of cooperating with experienced oral and maxillofacial pathologists is highlighted. We describe a rare case of intraoral malignant teratoma, and an extended literature review revealed that our case is the first ever reported.",

Utilizing single-cell transcriptome sequencing and comprehensive bioinformatics tools, including the CIBERSORT algorithm, we analyzed the immune cell landscape within NSCLC tissues. Our analysis revealed distinct NSCLC subtypes and delineated the developmental trajectories and functional distinctions of cDC1 cells. Key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pivotal functional modules within these cells were identified, highlighting PU.1 as a critical mediator underexpressed in NSCLC samples. Functionally, PU.1 demonstrated the induction of the NF-\u03baB pathway, which led to inhibited tumor proliferation and enhanced activation of cDC1, thereby suggesting its role in tumor immune surveillance. In vivo models confirmed the suppressive effect of PU.1 on NSCLC progression, mediated through its influence on cDC1 functionality via the NF-\u03baB pathway. These findings propose PU.1 as a promising target for NSCLC therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the importance of transcriptional regulators in the tumor microenvironment.",

        "AbstractText": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a critical role in regulating essential cellular processes that are frequently hijacked to promote cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC) in particular, the EGFR signaling pathway is frequently hyperactivated via receptor and/or ligand overexpression and downstream oncogenic mutations. Current EGFR-targeted therapies for metastatic CRC (mCRC) include the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cetuximab and panitumumab. However, intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted mAbs are commonly observed. Thus, additional biomarkers are necessary to better understand patient sensitivity to EGFR-targeted therapies. Furthermore, therapeutic targeting of alternative EGFR pathway components may serve as one mechanism to overcome EGFR-targeted mAb resistance. In this review, we discuss the mounting evidence supporting EGFR ligands epiregulin (EREG) and amphiregulin (AREG), which are overexpressed in CRC with potential key roles in tumor progression, as predictive biomarkers for EGFR-targeted therapy sensitivity as well as mediators of therapy resistance; though further studies are necessary to validate the prognostic roles and mechanisms by which these ligands contribute to resistance. Additionally, we review recent advances towards therapeutic targeting of EREG and AREG in cancer through the development and use of EREG- and AREG-targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). We conclude with a discussion on the roadblocks to clinical implementation of EREG and AREG as biomarkers as well as approaches to enhance efficacy of current EREG- and AREG-targeted strategies.",

Hence, we used SEER-Medicare data to evaluate racial/ethnic differences in MHI incidence among OC patients aged 65+. METHODS: Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, NH White, and Hispanic women diagnosed with OC in 2008-2015 without a mental health history 12 months prior to their cancer diagnosis were identified from SEER-Medicare. Cox proportional hazards regression evaluated new MHI incidence in the first five years post diagnosis and the differences by race/ethnicity. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for demographic/clinical covariates and healthcare access (HCA) dimensions. RESULTS: We identified 5441 OC patients, including 364 NH Black (6.7%), 4982 NH White (91.6%), and 95 Hispanic (1.7%) patients. About 41% of NH White, 33.3% of NH Black, and 37.2% of Hispanic OC patients were diagnosed with MHI during the follow-up period between 2008 and 2016. In the fully adjusted model, NH Black OC patients were less likely to be diagnosed with any MHI (aHR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.82), depression (aHR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.86), and anxiety disorder (aHR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.84), while Hispanic OC patients were less likely to be diagnosed with anxiety disorder (aHR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.95) compared to NH White OC patients. DISCUSSION: NH Black OC patients are less likely to receive a clinical MHI diagnosis compared to NH White OC patients. Further studies on racial differences in MHI incidence after OC diagnosis in primary cohorts are needed to better estimate population-level prevalence less vulnerable to exposure misclassification and to account for patient-level factors impacting MHI.",

While data have been published on how adolescents with T1D coped with pandemic-related stress, little is known about their parents' perspectives. To fill this gap, we explored parents' coping strategies. METHOD: At the baseline of a multisite trial of a psychosocial intervention for adolescents with T1D, parents answered an open-ended question, \"What is helping you through the pandemic?\" A multidisciplinary qualitative research team used thematic analysis to code, analyze responses, and generate themes and explored patterns by gender, study site, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status indices. RESULTS: Eighty-nine parents (89% female, 18% Hispanic/Latinx, 7% non-Hispanic Black/African American, 70% non-Hispanic White) provided text responses to the qualitative question. We generated six themes: safety practices, social efforts, maintaining a positive perspective, efforts to distract, cognitive avoidance, and religious/spiritual coping. The spiritual/religious coping theme was more common among Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx parents. There were no other demographic group patterns for the other themes. CONCLUSIONS: Themes aligned with primary control, secondary control, and disengagement coping strategies of the control-based model of coping. Religious and spiritual coping represented an additional coping category that was especially common in marginalized groups.

        "AbstractText": "The tobacco crisis confronting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) requires scale-up of effective tobacco control programs, such as Tobacco Free Teachers-Tobacco Free Society (TFT-TFS). We previously demonstrated the efficacy of TFT-TFS in increasing tobacco use cessation among teachers and schools' adoption of tobacco control policies in Bihar, India. To scale TFT-TFS, we are now pioneering a smartphone-based mobile learning strategy to train principals (or their designees) in Madhya Pradesh to implement and monitor TFT-TFS in schools. Research underscores the transformative potential of mobile learning: a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to in-person training methods. Our study is a unique opportunity to test a training approach that could have implications for wider and more efficient delivery of other public health programs. The strategic use of gamification and digital storytelling enhances the TFT-TFS mobile training app. Gamification mechanics-including points, leaderboards, and digital badging-foster a dynamic learning environment to enhance learning outcomes. This approach propels continuous participant engagement toward understanding and implementation of TFT-TFS's six monthly themes and four program components. The TFT-TFS smartphone training program weaves in elements of Indian culture, notably the symbolic use of colors and kites. The Indian kite festival celebrates communal harmony through healthy competition. Similarly, the app employs the idea of school kites, which are divided into six blank segments corresponding to the TFT-TFS monthly themes. Participants navigate each module, engaging with animated videos, digital assessments, and interactive activities.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a potential complication that can develop following cancer chemotherapy. OBJECTIVES: Due to limited medical interventions for the prevention and management of CIPN caused by vincristine, a painful and common complication, further research to find the mechanisms of CIPN and the development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies is needed. METHODS: We induced CIPN in male Wistar rats by administering intraperitoneal vincristine (VCR) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg for 10 days. Treatment involved micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) containing hesperidin and diosmin (MPFF; Daflon\u00ae) at doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg. Our investigation focused on levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissue and included a series of behavioral tests: Von Frey, grip strength, rotarod, open field, and hot plate tests. To examine the role of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in the effects of MPFF on VCR-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN), we also tested the effect of L-arginine (100 mg/kg i.p.) as a NO precursor and L-NAME (20 mg/kg i.p.) as a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor. RESULTS: Based on our behavioral tests, MPFF (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) effectively reduced some symptoms of VIPN, including mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia. Notably, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in the DRG tissue of the groups treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg of MPFF showed a significant reduction in inflammatory factors. These results underscore the potential of MPFF and the role of the NO signaling pathway in alleviating neuropathic pain caused by VCR. CONCLUSIONS: Micronized purified flavonoid fraction may be an effective treatment for VIPN by reducing mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in DRG tissue. The NO pathway may play a role in the effectiveness of MPFF in treating VIPN.",

        "AbstractText": "Gastric cancer remains a significant public health issue in Aotearoa, disproportionately affecting M\u0101ori and Pacific populations. The marked ethnic inequity in cancer incidence and mortality, with M\u0101ori experiencing diagnosis at a younger age and higher rates than non-M\u0101ori, underscores an urgent need for targeted interventions. Helicobacter pylori infection, a known precursor to gastric cancer, is a critical contributor to this disparity. In this position paper, we discuss the current state of gastric cancer and H. pylori management in Aotearoa, identifying key challenges including inconsistent guidelines, rising antibiotic resistance and inequitable access to treatment. We provide a comprehensive review of international evidence on H. pylori management, highlight emerging approaches, outline strong evidence supporting a 'population-based test and treat' approach for H. pylori eradication, and present a 'road map' tailored to Aotearoa's needs. Our proposed strategies emphasise the development of Aotearoa-specific guidelines that incorporate polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based antibiotic resistance testing, the need to promote post-eradication re-testing, the establishment of a national registry to monitor treatment outcomes, and the urgent rollout of a population-based test and treat programme. We advocate for a coordinated effort that aligns with the principles of Toit\u016b Te Tiriti and prioritises equity and justice in healthcare delivery. By addressing these barriers with targeted, evidence-driven solutions, we aim to reduce the burden of gastric cancer among M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples and achieve more equitable health outcomes across Aotearoa.",

Transport affects the frequency of cancer via access to healthcare, employment and other goods and services of society; physical (in)activity; exposure to transport-related pollution and climate change. In addition, avoidable transport health impacts overload the health system that delivers cancer care. The current transport system in Aotearoa/New Zealand is the result of policy choices made in the last 50-70 years which have privileged the private motor vehicle. We discuss examples of local work to support a healthier transport system, including action research with government partners creating infrastructure to support healthy travel, health professional advocacy in transport policy processes and involvement in coronial processes and a subsequent government advisory group. These, and other attempts at change, have had limited impact because of the elements that hold the current system in place; the weak regulatory architecture and institutions, commercial influences on policy and funding arrangements. Creating a healthy, cancer-preventing transport system requires not just focus on specific policy changes but reform of the policy making apparatus to ensure healthy people and planet are at the centre of decision making.",

        "AbstractText": "Older adults (65+) make up 60% of cancer diagnoses and 70% of deaths related to cancer (Marosi & K\u00f6ller, 2016). Although this age group experiences significant distress, behavioral studies investigating distress tend to be overrepresented by younger populations, leaving a gap in the knowledge about the distress needs of older adults (Chang et al., 2020). To bridge this gap, Dr. Katherine Ramos and Dr. Timothy Strauman of Duke University's Psychology Department conducted a pilot study that found two major themes related to distress in older adults: identity and resilience. The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychological impact of identity and resilience on the distress experienced by older adults with cancer. Using the two qualitative themes, identity and resilience, the researchers of this study conducted a narrative synthesis of contemporary literature surrounding identity, resilience, and their psychological impact on distress in older adults with cancer. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRIMSA) guidelines, the study found nine eligible articles. The study conducted a thematic analysis of the articles in this synthesis and found six themes: (1) reconstructing identity after diagnosis, (2) experiencing anxiety due to uncertainty of cancer outcomes, (3) needing to \"push along\" through a cancer diagnosis, (4) having access to social support increases resilience, (5) experiencing low resilience leads to demoralization, and (6) navigating cancer requires redefining oneself to confront cancer challenges. Future directions and clinical implications include adapting Self-System Therapy (SST) as a mental health intervention for older adults with cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) is a rare and highly aggressive cancer that originates in the bile duct; it has an average five-year survival rate of 9%, which makes it the cancer with the lowest survival rate among all 33 cancer types in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) Program. The aim of this study is to elucidate the key determinants of the high malignancy level of CHOL through computational and cell-based experimental approaches and, particularly, to investigate how bile acids (BAs) influence CHOL's propensity to metastasize. METHODS: Our study analyzed the transcriptomic data from 1835 tissue samples of 7 digestive system cancer types in the TCGA database and compared them with those of 330 control tissue samples. Multiple cellular and molecular factors were considered in the study, including the level of hypoxia, level of immune cell infiltration, degree of cellular dedifferentiation, and level of sialic acid (SA) accumulation on the surface of cancer cells. Using these factors, we developed a multivariable regression model for the five-year survival rate, as reported by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program reports, and analyzed how BA biology influences a few of these factors and causes CHOL to have a high malignancy level. RESULTS: CHOL exhibited the highest level of SA accumulation and B-cell infiltration among all cancer types studied. BAs inhibit the cell cycle progression through the receptor GPBAR1, thereby limiting the rate of nucleotide biosynthesis-which in turn forces the cells to increase SA biosynthesis in order to maintain the intracellular pH at a stable level-thereby driving cell migration and metastasis, as established in our previous study. CONCLUSIONS: BAs are the key contributors to the lowest five-year survival rate of CHOL among the seven cancer types studied here. This finding not only reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying the high malignancy level of CHOL but also provides a new potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of CHOL.",

        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) expresses abundant glycolytic enzymes and displays comprehensive glucose metabolism reprogramming. Aldolase A (ALDOA) plays a prominent role in glycolysis; however, little is known about its role in HCC development. In the present study, we aim to explore how ALDOA is involved in HCC proliferation. HCC proliferation was markedly suppressed both in vitro and in vivo following ALDOA knockout, which is consistent with ALDOA overexpression encouraging HCC proliferation. Mechanistically, ALDOA knockout partially limits the glycolytic flux in HCC cells. Meanwhile, ALDOA translocated to nuclei and directly interacted with c-Jun to facilitate its Thr93 phosphorylation by P21-activated protein kinase; ALDOA knockout markedly diminished c-Jun Thr93 phosphorylation and then dampened c-Jun transcription function. A crucial site Y364 mutation in ALDOA disrupted its interaction with c-Jun, and Y364S ALDOA expression failed to rescue cell proliferation in ALDOA deletion cells. In HCC patients, the expression level of ALDOA was correlated with the phosphorylation level of c-Jun (Thr93) and poor prognosis. Remarkably, hepatic ALDOA was significantly upregulated in the promotion and progression stages of diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC models, and the knockdown of A ldoa strikingly decreased HCC development in vivo. Our study demonstrated that ALDOA is a vital driver for HCC development by activating c-Jun-mediated oncogene transcription, opening additional avenues for anti-cancer therapies.",

This narrative review explores the benefits of current ERAS protocols in improving outcomes for these patients and provides insights into future advancements. Numerous studies have shown that ERAS protocols significantly reduce the length of hospital stays by several days compared to conventional care. Additionally, the implementation of ERAS is linked to a reduction in postoperative complications, including lower incidences of surgical site infections, anastomotic leaks, and postoperative ileus. Patients adhering to ERAS protocols also benefit from quicker gastrointestinal recovery, marked by an earlier return of bowel function. Some research indicates that colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery with ERAS protocols may experience improved overall survival rates. High compliance with ERAS protocols leads to better outcomes, yet achieving full adherence continues to be a challenge. Despite these advantages, implementation challenges persist, with compliance rates affected by varying clinical practices and resource availability. However, the future of ERAS looks promising with the incorporation of prehabilitation strategies and technologies such as wearable devices and telemedicine. These innovations provide real-time monitoring, enhance patient engagement, and improve postoperative follow-up, potentially transforming perioperative care in colorectal surgery and offering new avenues for enhanced patient outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is an innovative approach that delivers ultra-high dose rates exceeding 40 Gy in less than a second, aiming to widen the therapeutic window by minimizing damage to normal tissue while maintaining tumor control. This review explores the advancements, mechanisms, and clinical applications of FLASH-RT across various radiation sources. Electrons have been predominantly used due to technical feasibility, but their limited penetration depth restricts clinical application. Protons, offering deeper tissue penetration, are considered promising for treating deep-seated tumors despite challenges in beam delivery. Preclinical studies demonstrate that FLASH-RT reduces normal tissue toxicity in the lung, brain, skin, intestine, and heart without compromising antitumor efficacy. The mechanisms underlying the FLASH effect may involve oxygen depletion leading to transient hypoxia, reduced DNA damage in normal tissues, and modulation of immune and inflammatory responses. However, these mechanisms are incompletely understood, and inconsistent results across studies highlight the need for further research. Initial clinical studies, including treatment of cutaneous lymphoma and bone metastases, indicate the feasibility and potential benefits of FLASH-RT in patients. Challenges for clinical implementation include technical issues in dosimetry accuracy at ultra-high dose rates, adaptations in treatment planning systems, beam delivery methods, and economic considerations due to specialized equipment requirements. Future directions will involve comprehensive preclinical studies to optimize irradiation parameters, large-scale clinical trials to establish standardized protocols, and technological advancements to overcome limitations. FLASH-RT holds the potential to revolutionize radiotherapy by reducing normal tissue toxicity and improving therapeutic outcomes, but significant research is required for real-world clinical applications.",

Due to its higher linear energy transfer and relative biological effectiveness, CIRT is particularly effective against radioresistant tumors and those located near critical organs. Since the first dedicated CIRT facility was established in Japan in 1994, CIRT has demonstrated remarkable efficacy against various malignancies, including head and neck tumors, skull base and upper cervical spine tumors, non-small-cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and bone and soft tissue sarcomas. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of CIRT, highlighting its clinical indications and future directions. According to clinical studies, CIRT achieves high local control rates with manageable toxicity across multiple cancer types. For instance, in head and neck tumors (e.g., adenoid cystic carcinoma and mucosal melanoma), CIRT has achieved local control rates exceeding 80%. In early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer, CIRT has resulted in local control rates over 90% with minimal toxicity. Moreover, CIRT has shown promise in treating challenging cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer, where conventional therapies are limited. Nonetheless, the global adoption of CIRT remains limited due to high costs and complexity. Future directions include conducting randomized controlled trials to establish high-level evidence, integrating new technologies such as ultrahigh-dose-rate (FLASH) therapy, and expanding CIRT facilities globally with strategic planning and cost-effectiveness analyses. If these challenges are addressed, CIRT is poised to play a transformative role in cancer treatment, improving survival rates and the quality of life.",

This review examines recent advancements in treating advanced HCC, referencing the updated 2022 HCC guidelines and the Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer system. Historically, first-line systemic therapies included sorafenib and lenvatinib, with regorafenib, cabozantinib, or ramucirumab serving as second-line options. Since 2020, immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown superior overall survival than sorafenib, leading to the adoption of combination therapies such as atezolizumab with bevacizumab and durvalumab with tremelimumab as first-line treatments. The IMbrave150 study demonstrated that atezolizumab-bevacizumab significantly extended median overall survival and progression-free survival, with the longest survival reported in any phase 3 trial for advanced HCC. Similarly, the HIMALAYA study indicated that durvalumab combined with tremelimumab significantly improved survival rates. Second-line therapies now include regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab, nivolumab with ipilimumab, and pembrolizumab, each offering benefits for specific patient populations. Nonetheless, these therapies are associated with side effects that require careful management. Traditional targeted therapies can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular events, and hand-foot skin reactions, whereas immune checkpoint inhibitors may cause immune-related adverse events affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine system. Clinicians must be well-versed in these treatments and their potential side effects to provide optimal patient care. The emergence of combination therapies targeting complex biological pathways signifies a new paradigm in HCC treatment, emphasizing the importance of continuous education and vigilant monitoring to optimize patient outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with poor clinical outcomes due to challenges in early detection and limited efficacy of current treatments such as receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy. HCC exhibits significant heterogeneity at both histopathological and molecular levels, complicating its management but offering potential for personalized therapeutic approaches. This review outlines the morpho-molecular heterogeneity of HCC and summarizes various histological subtypes, including steatohepatitic, clear cell, macrotrabecular-massive, scirrhous, lymphocyte-rich, and fibrolamellar HCCs. Each subtype possesses distinct clinical, histological, and molecular features; for instance, steatohepatitic HCC is associated with metabolic dysfunction and shows IL-6/JAK/STAT activation, while clear cell HCCs often have IDH1 mutations and favorable prognosis. The macrotrabecular-massive subtype is linked to poor outcomes and TP53 mutations, whereas scirrhous HCCs express stemness markers and have TSC1/TSC2 mutations. Lymphocyte-rich HCCs are characterized by immune cell infiltration and better prognosis. CTNNB1-mutated HCCs show specific morphological features and may benefit from targeted therapies. Understanding these subtypes and associated molecular alterations is crucial for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including potential predictive biomarkers and personalized treatments. Additionally, the identification of patterns like vessels-encapsulating-tumor-clusters offers prognostic implications and may guide therapeutic decisions. Recent molecular studies have enhanced our comprehension of HCC heterogeneity, laying the groundwork for more personalized approaches. Pathologists play a vital role in recognizing these subtypes, aiding in prognosis prediction and treatment planning.

Projected to become the primary cause of HCC by 2030, MASH-HCC presents unique clinical challenges. This review examines its clinical management, including surveillance strategies and treatment advances, and discusses prospects to overcome existing challenges. MASH-HCC accounts for 10%-20% of HCC cases, particularly in Western countries, with a rising incidence due to obesity. Risk factors include cirrhosis, diabetes, obesity, alcohol, smoking, genetic polymorphisms (e.g., PNPLA3), and microbiome alterations. The pathogenesis involves fibrosis, immune dysfunction (e.g., T-cell impairment), and molecular changes. Prevention focuses on lifestyle modifications. Surveillance in patients with MASH cirrhosis is crucial but is hindered by poor ultrasound sensitivity in obese patients, necessitating alternative methods. Treatment mirrors that of other HCC types, but comorbidities and potentially reduced efficacy of immunotherapy necessitate tailored approaches. MASH is becoming the leading cause of HCC, necessitating lifestyle interventions for prevention. Improved surveillance and early detection are critical but challenging due to obesity-related factors. Treatments align with those for other HCC types, but comorbidities and potential differences in immunotherapy efficacy due to T-cell dysfunction require careful consideration. Key needs include identifying molecular drivers in non-cirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, developing preventive therapies, refining surveillance methods, and tailoring treatments.

We conducted a prospective study on targeted therapy based on comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). We report molecular pathways of ERBB gene and outcomes and explored the molecular mechanism of resistance. METHODS: CGP was done for all consecutive GBC patients aged >18 years. Foundation medicines CDx and TarGT Absolute were used for analysis. Patients were enrolled from Jan 2017 till Dec 2022. Patient recruitment was done after ethics committee approval. Trastuzumab and/ or lapatinib were used as targeted therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients out of 60 had ERBB1-4 gene alteration (amplification and/or mutation) that resulted in activation of PI3K/AKT/MTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK pathways. ERBB amplification (16%) was the most common genetic aberration. Mutations in TP53, RB1, CDKs, and cyclins lead to dysregulation of cell cycle and evasion of apoptosis. A total of 50% of ERBB2-positive patients carry CDK12 amplifications. The intrinsic resistance to anti-ERBB2 therapy was primarily due to downstream activation in ERBB pathway (PIK3CA) and its crosstalk with cell cycle pathway (TP53 and CDK12), JAK/STAT, VEGF, CTNNB1, and ARID1A that are known to drive MAPK/ERK signaling. Mesenchymal epithelial transition amplification or activating mutations is mechanism of resistance to anti-ERBB2 therapy. Kinase/Juxta membrane domain mutations in ERBB family proteins are also one of the potential mechanisms of resistance. CONCLUSION: GBC is enriched with ERBB gene aberrations.

Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) has been tested in multiple roles in the management of cervical cancer but the evidence from India is limited. METHODS: This was a prospective, cohort pilot study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in central India. Study subjects were patients with locally advanced carcinoma cervix treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy between June 2017 and May 2018. All patients underwent pre and post-treatment SCC-Ag testing which was continued serially every 3 months for a total follow-up of 24 months. A cut-off value of 1.5 ng/ml or more was used to define a positive test. Chi-Square tests, Pearson's correlation testing and Kaplan Meier plots were used to study the association of different patient and tumour variables with the SCC-Ag levels. Test validity of serial measurements of SCC-Ag was also measured for detection of recurrence. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were included. SCC-Ag levels were strongly correlated with tumour stage and presence of lymph nodal metastases. Post-treatment abnormal SCC-Ag levels were significantly associated with a poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS). Serial measurement of SCC-Ag levels proved to be a good screening tool for early detection of recurrences even before clinical symptoms or signs developed with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 91.8%.

Despite their effectiveness, traditional treatment approaches such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery frequently have negative side effects and high costs. New approaches, such as gene therapy, are promising but are hampered by high costs and accessibility problems. Nanoparticles (NPs) facilitate targeted drug delivery by leveraging passive targeting mechanisms, such as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and by actively targeting surfaces with ligands for site-specific binding through the functionalization of surfaces. This approach enhances therapeutic results while lowering off-target toxicities.

        "ArticleTitle": "An overview of randomized phase III clinical trials of cancer nanomedicines.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Cancer therapy has undergone significant advances in recent decades attributed to personalized medicine and targeted drug delivery. Among the promising approaches, the use of nano-based delivery systems has become a relevant approach capable of improving treatment by releasing antineoplastic drugs at the target site, improving therapeutic efficacy, minimizing cytotoxicity in healthy tissues, and ultimately, reducing the intensity of adverse effects of chemotherapy. This study prospectively evaluated the impact of formulating anti-neoplastic drugs as nanomedicines on clinical response, overall survival, safety, and quality of life of cancer patients, based on the outcomes of randomized clinical trials. METHODS: A literature review was carried out by systematically searching the PubMed/MEDical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) databases for phase III clinical trials, comparing nanomedicines with conventional therapies for the treatment of various cancer types. RESULTS: The nanomedicines analyzed were those that are approved and used in Brazil, considering the country's emerging market for advanced cancer treatments. From a total of 303 articles found, 26 articles were selected for systematic review. Studies showed that PEGylated l-asparaginase achieved a similar therapeutic effect to that of l-asparaginase, with fewer applications due to its longer half-life. Paclitaxel bound to albumin improved therapeutic efficacy as well as reduced infusion time and solvent-related toxicity of the conventional paclitaxel formulation. PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin showed better pharmacokinetics, reduced cardiotoxicity, and improved quality of life in cancer patients compared to that of free doxorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces the scientific evidence of the added value of nanomedicines to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity in patients under chemotherapy.",

MBD, a prevalent and debilitating complication of multiple myeloma, leads to bone pain, fractures, and skeletal-related events (SREs), which profoundly impact patients' quality of life. The guidelines offer a thorough framework for diagnosis, treatment, and continual assessment, emphasizing early detection and consistent monitoring using imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment strategies prioritize the careful application of anti-myeloma agents, bisphosphonates, and denosumab to minimize bone loss and decrease SRE risk, complemented by surgical and radiotherapy interventions for structural or pain-related issues. Supportive care measures, including pain management, rehabilitation, nutritional support, and dental evaluations, play a crucial role in enhancing patient outcomes and preserving quality of life.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Human behaviors and tumors go hand in hand. The wave of globalization has brought about a global homogenization of human behaviors, which further triggers a potential global human behavior-related cancer burden (HBRCB) convergence. METHODS: This study systematically evaluated the global, regional, and national metrics of HBRCBs over the last 30 years using data from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2019 results and the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository. RESULTS: The results showed the global remission and convergence of HBRCB in the last three decades and the foreseeable future (2020-2044). Overall, HBRCBs are decreasing with the global emphasis on positive dietary habits, safe sex, substance addiction withdrawal, and active physical exercise habits. Globally, from 1990 to 2019, with the development of social development index (SDI) level from 0.511 to 0.651, the HBRCBs had been decreasing from 1507.908 to 1145.344 in age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (ASDALY) and from 61.467 to 49.449 in (age-standardized death rates) ASDR per 100,000 population with changes of -24.04 % and -19.55 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the variance in HBRCBs among countries and territories generally showed a decreasing or flat trend. The variance of HBRCBs among 204 countries and territories in 2019-2044 decreased from 1495.210 to 449.202 in males and from 214.640 to 78.848 in females for ASDR due to all behavior risks, and from 911,211.676 to 317,233.590 in males and from 146,171.660 to 62,926.660 in females for ASDALY. The global HBRCBs was becoming more uniform due to the globalization of human behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the significance of addressing HBRCBs as a uniform and continuous issue in future global health promotion. It also demonstrated the potential existence of a chain effect in global health, where globalization leads to human behavior homogenization, which in turn results in HBRCB convergence. Properly measuring the commonalities and individualities among different regions and finding a balance when designing and evaluating HBRCB-related global policies in the global convergence trend of HBRCBs will be major concerns in the future.",

        "ArticleTitle": "SenSet, a novel human lung senescence cell gene signature, identifies cell-specific senescence mechanisms.",
        "AbstractText": "Cellular senescence is a major hallmark of aging. Senescence is defined as an irreversible growth arrest observed when cells are exposed to a variety of stressors including DNA damage, oxidative stress, or nutrient deprivation. While senescence is a well-established driver of aging and age-related diseases, it is a highly heterogeneous process with significant variations across organisms, tissues, and cell types. The relatively low abundance of senescence in healthy aged tissues represents a major challenge to studying senescence in a given organ, including the human lung. To overcome this limitation, we developed a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning framework to generate a comprehensive senescence marker gene list in human lungs (termed SenSet) using the largest publicly available single-cell lung dataset, the Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA). We validated SenSet in a highly complex ex vivo human 3D lung tissue culture model subjected to the senescence inducers bleomycin, doxorubicin, or irradiation, and established its sensitivity and accuracy in characterizing senescence. Using SenSet, we identified and validated cell-type specific senescence signatures in distinct lung cell populations upon aging and environmental exposures. Our study presents the first comprehensive analysis of senescent cells in the healthy aging lung and uncovers cell-specific gene signatures of senescence, presenting fundamental implications for our understanding of major lung diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma.",

The functional outcome depends on the salvage of important structures and optimal reconstruction of the bony defect. On-going advances in technology have helped in 3-dimensional templating of patient's anatomy and real-time tracking of instruments during surgery. Computer navigation system joins patients' imaging information to real-time anatomy by using tracking and registration of pre- and/or intra-operative acquired images. We share our experience with 15 navigation-assisted surgeries performed at a single institute. We used BrainLab navigation system coupled with the Ziehm vision RFD 3D C-arm for intra-op registration in our cases. Our study did not compare the accuracy of the resection with the intended plan using imaging in all cases; however, margins were negative in all malignant cases. These patients were followed up for a short period. Multicenter comparative studies with longer follow-ups are required to establish their clinical effectiveness. Current evidence suggests that this technology may be applicable in challenging anatomical locations and joint/physis preserving tumor surgery to achieve precise resections or curettages that accurately match intended resection plans.",

        "ArticleTitle": "To Assess the Predictive and Prognostic Role of PD-L1 and CD8 Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), introduced in 1970 for inoperable tumors, has become the standard treatment approach in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Pathological complete response (pCR) following NACT is an important indicator for disease-free survival. An increased number of CD8-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor center is thought to indicate an effective antitumor-immune response. Aberrant expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) allows tumor cells to escape the host immune system. Change in PD-L1 expression may serve as an indirect indicator to assess the response to NACT. The residual cancer burden (RCB) category defined by routine histopathological evaluation represents the extent of residual disease and may predict disease-free survival. In this study, we assessed the expression of PD-L1 and CD8 in pre- and post-NACT specimens and their role in predicting pathological response to NACT. This study was conducted for a period of 3 years at Uttar Pradesh University of Medical Sciences, Saifai. PD-L1 and CD8 expression was compared on pre- and post-NACT tissue specimens. Pathological response to NACT was assessed by the RCB system. A total of 62 cases were evaluated. The mean age of patients was 47.58\u2009\u00b1\u200911.16 years. Six (9.7%) patients achieved pCR (RCB-0). PD-L1 and CD8 expression was found to be positively associated with pathological response (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for both). Tumors with negative PD-L1 (OR\u2009=\u20090.02) and pre-NACT intermediate/low expression of CD8 in TILs (OR\u2009=\u20090.11) are less likely to show a response to NACT. Prognostic role of PD-L1 and CD8 was also assessed by the Nottingham prognostic index (NPI). The expression of PD-L1 and CD8-positive TILs correlate with response to chemotherapy. High PD-L1 and CD8-positive TILs may predict better response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

We compared the neoadjuvant chemotherapy usage and oncological outcomes in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for variant versus pure urothelial histology bladder cancer. This was a retrospective comparative cohort study. Data was collected from the electronic database of our hospital from June 2009 to June 2018. Two hundred forty-one patients underwent radical cystectomy in the study period. Patients were divided into two groups (Group A - variant histology bladder cancer and Group B - pure urothelial histology). The primary outcome was overall survival. The secondary outcomes included recurrence free survival and complications. Of the 241 patients, 41 had variant histology. Histological variants were sarcomatoid (11), sarcoma (4), squamous cell (8), neuroendocrine (3), adenocarcinoma (8), and others (7). The median age was 59\u00a0years in both groups. The median duration of follow-up in Groups A and B was 12.5 and 24\u00a0months, respectively. NACT was given in 12 and 14% (Groups A and B). The median overall survival in Groups A and B was 24 (95% CI 14-33) and 40\u00a0months (95% CI 29-50), respectively (95% CI 25-50) (p\u2009=\u20090.12). The median OS trend is better with chemotherapy among both VH (NACT vs no NACT: not reached and 24\u00a0months) and UC (NACT vs no NACT: 40 and 36\u00a0months) groups. Margin positivity rate was significantly higher in Group A (12%) compared to Group B (3%) (p\u2009<\u20090.03). The recurrence free survival in Groups A and B was 16(CI 3-28) and 38(CI 23-52) months, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.06). There was no difference in post-operative complications (Clavien Dindo) between the two groups (p\u2009=\u20090.59). Variant histology bladder cancers exhibit an aggressive behavior with early recurrences and a poorer overall survival compared to pure urothelial bladder cancer.

The median overall survival (OS) was 40.8\u00a0months, and disease-free survival (DFS) was 36\u00a0months. On univariate analysis, depth of invasion (DOI), close margin, presence of lympho-vascular space invasion (LVSI), perineural invasion (PNI), groin metastases, and not receiving adjuvant therapy were significantly associated with increased recurrence rates. Deeper stromal invasion, presence of LVSI, groin node metastases, and recurrent disease were associated with poor OS on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, DOI, tumor-free margin (TFM), and PNI were significantly associated with DFS, and a previous history of recurrence was associated with OS. Vulvar cancers are relatively rare tumors with several local tumor factors such as TFM, DOI, LVSI, and lymph node status which may help determine oncological outcomes.

Majority of the patients are presenting in an advanced stage and are frequently showing triple negative phenotype. Additionally, in India, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) prevalence is much higher in comparison to the western world. We undertook this study with an aim to characterize TNBC based on a panel of immunohistochemical markers to explore their pathogenesis, behavior, treatment response, and outcomes in respect to disease progression, disease-free survival, and death. The study was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee which included 63 TNBC cases for evaluating expression of GATA3 and p53. Basal cell markers were done only in GATA3 negative cases. The IHC markers were correlated with different clinical profile, demographic factors, and outcome. A total of 63 patients were included in the study out of which 37 patients had disease-free survival; 8 patients showed disease progression; and 18 patients died. Among the patients, 29 were GATA positive. Out of those 29 patients, 15 were also p53 positive.

This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of multivisceral resection in advanced EOC, focusing on the effect of surgical complexity on post-operative morbidity, time to adjuvant treatment, and overall survival. This single-arm study included 74 patients with advanced EOC who underwent multivisceral resection between January 2018 and December 2021 at the Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram. The study introduced a modified version of Aletti's Surgical Complexity Scoring system to classify surgeries as intermediate or high complexity. Post-operative morbidity was assessed using the Clavien-Dindo scoring system. Time to adjuvant treatment and overall survival were also analyzed. Of the 74 patients, 80% underwent intermediate complexity surgeries, while 20% had high complexity procedures. Major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo grades 3 and 4) occurred in 10.9% of patients, with no significant difference between intermediate and high complexity surgeries (p\u2009=\u20090.86). Adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated within 6\u00a0weeks for 89.2% of patients. The overall 12-month and 18-month survival probabilities were 94% and 85%, respectively. Complete cytoreduction (CC-0) was achieved in 93.3% of cases, with significantly lower mortality rates compared to non-CC-0 cases (18.8% vs. 60%). Multivisceral resection in advanced EOC demonstrates favorable outcomes with acceptable morbidity rates, regardless of surgical complexity. The high rate of complete cytoreduction and impressive survival probabilities underscore the potential benefits of aggressive surgical approaches in advanced EOC. Although the subset analysis favored primary cytoreduction, further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm these findings and explore the impact of primary versus interval debulking surgery on long-term outcomes.",

These tumours have been divided into patterns of infiltration, namely expansile and infiltrative types, which in turn have prognostic significance. A hospital-based, retrospective analytical cohort study was conducted at a tertiary cancer center in Northeast India, from September 2019 to September 2023. The objectives were to study the impact of pattern of infiltration on oncological outcomes and to prognosticate them. Histology slides of the diagnosed cases were re-examined according to WHO protocol. Overall incidence of pMOC in our study was 3.3% (32/958 patients). Review of histology slides excluded 8 cases. The expansile pattern was seen in 71.9% (n\u2009=\u200923), and infiltrative pattern in 28.1% (n\u2009=\u20099). The most common presenting stage at diagnosis was IA in both expansile (30.4%, n\u2009=\u20097) and infiltrative (44.4%, n\u2009=\u20099) types.

Adopting AS presents unique challenges in India given the need for proper understanding, adequate sonographic expertise, meticulous follow-up and acceptance of the patients and clinicians for active surveillance of diagnosed PTC. We present our data on the feasibility of AS at our centre in the last 7\u00a0years. We started adopting AS for patients with PTC or suspected PTC under AS in July 2017. Most of the patients had FNAC category Bethesda V or VI and/or USG category ACR-TIRADS TR4 or TR5 nodules. In all patients, the PTC was discovered incidentally. A baseline CT scan of the neck and chest was performed if indicated and in select patients, serial serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) were done. Patients were followed up semi-annually with neck ultrasound performed by a single operator. We have been following 17 patients with PTC under the AS clinic. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 45.17 (14.7) years with 13 females and a median follow-up of 40\u00a0months (IQR 40-46; range 13-86), and none have undergone thyroid surgery. The PTC was discovered incidentally in 12 patients during a neck sonogram for evaluation of painful swallowing or salivary gland-related symptoms and evaluation of primary hyperparathyroidism; 2 patients on CT chest for pulmonary symptoms and 3 were \"PETomas\" during evaluation of their primary cancer (colon cancer, breast cancer and multiple myeloma). Out of the 3 patients who underwent FDG-PET scan, the SUV max of the PTC was 4, 4.8 and 14.6. All except one were uni-focal PTC with size (largest dimension on USG) ranging from 4.8 to 21\u00a0mm and median volume 0.21\u00a0mL (IQR 0.21-0.37\u00a0mL). The baseline median Tg levels were 12.95\u00a0ng/mL (range is 0.07 to 51\u00a0ng/mL), and anti-Tg was elevated in 4 patients (132\u00a0IU/mL, 156\u00a0IU/mL, 696\u00a0IU/mL, 4000\u00a0IU/mL). Serial Tg and anti Tg levels were measured over time in 4 patients. The patient with the largest PTC (21\u00a0mm) who is currently under AS had Eisenmenger syndrome. The longest duration of follow-up in the AS cohort is 86\u00a0months. One patient conceived and had a healthy baby during active surveillance with no significant increase in the size of the tumour. On follow-up, the volume change in the nodules ranged from\u2009-\u200944 to 335% with 35% (6/17) showing decrement and 65% (11/17) showing increment. The change in the largest dimension ranged from\u2009-\u200928 to 154% with a decrement of 41% (7/17) and increment of 59% (10/17). However, a significant increase in the volume (>\u200950%) was noted only in 2 patients, and a significant increase in tumour dimension (>\u20093\u00a0mm) was documented in only 2 patients on follow-up. None of the patients has developed regional or distant metastasis, and none has undergone surgery. Our study provides insights into the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with incidentally diagnosed PTC undergoing active surveillance. Our findings support the feasibility and safety of this approach in select individuals, with emphasis on meticulous periodic neck sonography by a single operator, and a like-minded supportive thyroid cancer team.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Molecular diagnostics are critical for informing cancer patient care. In Ireland, the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) develops cancer therapy regimens, which include relevant information on molecular indications. Here, we present a collated overview of the current molecular indications of all NCCP systemic anti-cancer therapy regimens and the funding statuses of their associated drugs. Furthermore, we also provide estimates for the scale of required molecular testing in cancer therapy and for the clinical genetic sequencing capacity of Ireland, and provide a summary of current cancer clinical trials in Ireland which have molecular components. METHODS: Through a combination of web scraping, keyword search, and manual review, we performed a full review of all 856 indications included in the 533 therapy regimens published to date by the NCCP to identify therapy indications with explicit molecular criteria. For all cancer types identified in these indications, we obtained incidence rates in Ireland from National Cancer Registry Ireland to predict the number of patients yearly who stand to benefit from a molecular test. We then applied molecular subtype rates from published literature to estimate the number of patients who would then qualify for a relevant molecularly guided therapy. RESULTS: We identified 246 indications for 175 NCCP therapy regimens that include molecular criteria. These 246 molecular indications encompassed 101 genetic criteria, 161 cellular biomarker criteria, 63 molecularly informed drugs, and over 20 cancer types. We estimated that up to approximately 55% of cancer patients in Ireland could qualify for a molecular test and that the majority of tested patients would qualify for a treatment informed by a molecular test. CONCLUSIONS: As personalised cancer medicine continues to develop in Ireland, this study will provide a baseline understanding of current practices. We anticipate that work such as this will help to inform planning in the healthcare system.",

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of functional vitamin B12 deficiency and elevated serum vitamin B12 levels among Indian MPN patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated serum vitamin B12, homocysteine, methyl malonic acid\u00a0(MMA) and holotranscobalamin levels among 176 MPN patients. Serum vitamin B12 levels between 150 and 950 pg/mL were considered normal. Functional vitamin B12 deficiency was diagnosed based on combination of elevated serum MMA\u00a0(>\u20090.4 nmol/mL) and homocysteine\u00a0(>\u200915 \u00b5mol/L) levels and low serum holotranscobalamin levels\u00a0(<\u200925 pmol/L), irrespective of serum vitamin B12 levels and clinical manifestations of deficiency. RESULTS: Among patients enrolled\u00a0(n\u2009=\u2009176), 108\u00a0(61%) had chronic phase CML, 37\u00a0(21%) PV, 23\u00a0(13%) PMF and 8\u00a0(4%) ET. Nearly one-third were newly diagnosed to have MPNs and treatment na\u00efve. Elevated serum vitamin B12 levels\u00a0(>\u2009950pg/mL) were seen in about a quarter\u00a0(n\u2009=\u200945) of MPN patients. Half\u00a0(n\u2009=\u200989) were detected to have functional vitamin B12 deficiency. No association was found between functional vitamin B12 deficiency and serum vitamin B12 levels and functional deficiency prevalence did not differ significantly between different types of MPNs and between newly diagnosed (treatment-na\u00efve) and already treated MPNs. CONCLUSION: About a quarter of MPN patients had elevated serum B12 levels and half had functional vitamin B12 deficiency. Functional deficiency was diagnosed independent of serum vitamin B12 levels. Hence, evaluation for functional deficiency should be carried out irrespective of serum vitamin B12 levels. Future studies should evaluate potential benefit of vitamin B12 replacement in MPN patients with functional vitamin B12 deficiency.",

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between gravidity and anemia in a subset of women enrolled in the Tabari Cohort study. This case-control study included 1676 women aged 35-70 years old with at least one pregnancy. The case group consisted of 838 women who were anemic by definition, and were included using the census method. The control group (838 women) was randomly selected from the rest of the study population based on age. In this study, a subset of data from the enrolment phase of the Tabari cohort was analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression, chi-square test, and independent sample t-test in SPSS. The mean gravidity in the case and control group was 3.23\u2009\u00b1\u20091.74 and 3.53\u2009\u00b1\u20091.98, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.001).In the case group, the frequencies of 1, 2, 3, 4, and \u2265\u20095 gravidity was 10.3%, 30.2%, 25.8%, 15.5%, and 18.3%, respectively; in the control group, the frequencies were 8.2%, 27.8%, 24.7%, 14.9%, and 24.3%, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.036). After adjusting for all confounding variables, the OR (95%CI) of gravidity 2, 3, 4, and \u2265\u20095 for anemia were 0.89 (0.60-1.33), 0.81 (0.52-1.26), 0.75 (0.45-1.24), and 0.52 (0.30-0.88), respectively.

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Directed therapies employing small (SM) and large (LM) molecule drugs to target tumor antigens are used for treatment. Theranostics radiolabels them for imaging and radiation treatment. Poor radiopharmaceutical kinetics, prolonged circulating times, and high nontarget radiation to normal tissues after intravenous (i.v) injection limits translation. Intra-arterial (i.a.) procedures locally concentrate nonspecific chemotherapies or radiation to treat hepatic tumors (HT). Pseudovascular isolation (PVI), embolizes the HT arterioles, blocking efferent flow into capillaries isolating the HT from the systemic vasculature maximizing uptake to provide curative tumor specific absorbed radiation. METHODS: [\u00b9\u2078F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) SM and 99mTc-labeled macroaggregated albumin (MAA) LM surrogates were used to assess biodistribution in a porcine HT. Injected dose per gram (%ID/g) of the tracers obtained from 1 to 120\u00a0min after control (i.v) and experimental i.a. infusion with PVI. RESULTS: SM drug delivered to HT was 290-366% greater for PVI vs. i.v (60\u00a0min %ID/g 31.26\u2009\u00b1\u20092.55 vs. 8.83\u2009\u00b1\u20090.55, p\u2009=\u20090.033; 120\u00a0min 29.28\u2009\u00b1\u20091.44 vs. 8.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.96, p\u2009=\u20090.145). Mean HT uptake of LM with PVI was up to 760% greater than i.v. without washout (60\u00a0min %ID/g 80.01\u2009\u00b1\u20092.87 vs. 10.61\u2009\u00b1\u20090.96 p\u2009=\u20090.001; 81.72\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0 vs. 11.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 p\u2009=\u20090.001 at 120\u00a0min). CONCLUSION: PVI significantly increases the concentration of both SM and LM drugs within a HT compared to i.v. infusion. PVI with tumor specific drugs offers an opportunity to locally cure HT using a drug that specifically targets tumor antigens.",

Here, we provide a workflow of mapping the cancer cell secretome in an unbiased way using amino acid-analog labeling in combination with mass spectrometry. The generation of single cells from fresh tumors, isolation of primary cancer cells from a complex multi-cellular pool, and the detection of newly synthesized proteins that are secreted into the medium is described in detailed protocols. Using this experimental pipeline the secretome of cancer cells across different tumors can be determined, paving the way to unravel cell-cell communication networks in the tumor microenvironment, which may uncover novel therapeutic targets.",

One consequence of this metabolic shift is the production of lactate, an oncometabolite often found at elevated levels in tumors. Lactate not only fuels the growth of cancer cells but also promotes angiogenesis, immune escape, and metastasis, thereby contributing to tumor progression and resistance to therapy. This highlights the importance of lactate in cancer metabolism and underscores the need for methods to measure it. In this study, we describe various centrifugation and elution protocols to isolate interstitial fluid and measure lactate in experimental tumors. These tumors were generated in immunocompetent mice using the MC38 colon cancer cell line. We propose that, with minor modifications, the methods here described could be successfully adapted for use with tumors originating from other human or murine cell lines. Furthermore, these methods could potentially enable the detection of other oncometabolites in the tumor microenvironment, which could have significant implications for both basic research and therapeutic strategies.",

        "AbstractText": "Tyro-3, Axl, and Mertk (abbreviated TAM receptors or TAMs), have well established functions in efferocytosis, the process by which apoptotic cells are engulfed by phagocytic cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. In addition to their roles in efferocytosis, TAMs are also pleiotropic immune modulators that dampen inflammation and promote immune resolution and tolerance. Mice lacking one or more of the TAM receptors in various murine models leads to chronic inflammation and in some cases autoimmunity and chronic disease. In recent years, TAMs have emerged as important contributors in cancer, functioning both as oncogenic tyrosine kinases as well as immune modulators. Many recent studies indicate that TAM inhibitors, including monoclonal antibodies, kinase inhibitors, decoy receptors and ligands, and small molecular wedge inhibitors have therapeutic potential in cancer biology and immunotherapy. Here, we report the development and characterization of two type of TAM reporter lines that can be adapted to screen a wide range of TAM inhibitor types. The first involves TAM-IFN-\u03b3R1 chimeric CHO lines, where the extracellular domain of human TAM receptors is fused with the transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains of the human IFN-\u03b3 receptor chain. The second type of TAM reporter line described is the EGFR-TAM chimeric CHO lines, which involves fusing the extracellular domain of the EGFR receptor with the transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domains and cytosolic tail of TAM receptors. With minimal adaptation, both lines can be adopted for high throughput screening with immune-oncology applications.",

Patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS), a biomimetic 3D-patient tumor avatar (3D-PTA), are comprised of cancer cells and autologous tumor-infiltrating immune and stromal cells that are grown within collagen hydrogels embedded in a 3D microfluidic culture device to model physiologic conditions and enable the study of tumor-immune dynamics. PDOTS and their murine counterparts (MDOTS, murine-derived organotypic tumor spheroids) are responsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and mirror in vivo response dynamics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 278 cases of breast resection diagnosed with IBC-NST from 2014 to 2019. Total tumor buds were counted in 10 high-power fields of a hematoxylin and eosin-stained section with the most infiltrative area at 400\u00d7 magnification. The cutoff value for TB was obtained using receiver operating characteristic analysis for mortality and recurrence risk; this cutoff value was used to classify TB into two categories: low and high grades. The relationship between TB and prognostic factors and the effect of TB on the survival of patients were investigated. RESULTS: This study revealed a statistically significant relationship between high-grade TB and increased tumor size, advanced pathological primary tumor (pT) category, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, blood vessel invasion, increased recurrence, and mortality as well as reduced overall and disease-free survival.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from an academic health system in Toronto, Ontario. The study included all admissions associated with an ICD10 code of R18 (ascites), I85.0 or I98.3 (variceal bleeding), or K70-K77 (diseases of the liver). Patients were selected to receive the transitional care (intervention group) or not (no-intervention group) by discretion of the hepatologists. We used a proportional hazard model to estimate the associations between receiving the intervention and the marginal probability of 30-, 60-, and 90-day readmission in the presence of death as a competing risk. We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our estimates to various sources of bias, including adjusting for propensity of receiving the intervention estimated using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 803 admissions were included. Receiving transitional care was associated with a reduction in risk of 30-day readmission (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.30-0.85), 60-day readmission (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.40-0.91), and 90-day readmission (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.37-0.83). The negative associations remained statistically significant under the sensitivity analyses, except for the propensity-adjusted estimate for the 60-day outcome. CONCLUSIONS: A nurse practitioner-led transitional care program could be effective in reducing the risk of readmission for patients with liver disease.

His medical history also included hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and prostate cancer. On upper endoscopy, no lesions were found, despite the presence of a large non-mobilizable clot in the gastric fundus. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, and, on the next day, reassessment esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal. On the eighth day of hospitalization, the patient presented with hemorrhagic shock due to new-onset hematemesis. Upper endoscopy revealed an esophageal 10-mm non-ulcerated mucosal depression with a visible vessel at 20 cm from the incisors, closed with 3 hemoclips. Thoracic CT angiography showed a brachiocephalic trunk aneurysm with aortoesophageal fistulization. He was deemed unsuitable for endovascular or surgical treatment. About 2 months later, the patient was admitted to the emergency room in cardiorespiratory arrest following an episode of hematemesis at home. DISCUSSION: This report highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic complexity of AEF. Endoscopic treatment can be the main therapy in patients without indication for vascular intervention. The purpose was to palliate new bleeding episodes, maintaining a very poor prognosis.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Little has been written about the role of COVID assessment centres set up during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive study reviewed and compared COVID cases presenting to the Mount Sinai Hospital COVID assessment centre and emergency departments over a 4-month period at the start of the pandemic in 2020. RESULTS: Of 185 COVID-positive presentations, 115 (62.2%) were assessed in the COVID assessment centre and 70 (37.8%) in the emergency department. Patients seen in the COVID assessment centre tended to be younger (mean age 33.5 years) than in the emergency department (mean age 51.8 years, P < .001), had fewer comorbidities (P \u2264 .05 for hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and cancer), and were less likely to have shortness of breath, fever, or focal lung findings (P < .01 for all). Chest imaging was ordered for 57.1% of emergency department cases versus 0% for COVID assessment centre cases (P < .001). Overall, 21 out of 69 (30.4%) COVID-positive cases were admitted from the emergency department, while all COVID assessment centre cases were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: The Mount Sinai COVID assessment centre assessed the majority of COVID cases early on in the pandemic at this site. While these were milder COVID infections, this decreased the overall number of COVID infections that might otherwise have needed to be seen in the emergency department.",

However, real-time monitoring of PDT progress and accurate determination of the optimal treatment timing remain challenges. In this work, we selected carbon dots (CDs) and new indocyanine green (IR820) as building units to fabricate a smart nanotheranostics (CDs-IR820 assembly) with the characteristics of controlled release and real-time imaging to solve the time gap between diagnosis and treatment. The fabricated CDs-IR820 assembly locked the photosensitivity of the CDs and could degrade under 750\u00a0nm laser irradiation to achieve controlled release of the CDs, thus used for cell imaging and producing single oxygen under the white light. Besides, the released CDs could migrate from the mitochondria to the nucleus during the PDT process, indicating the cell activity, which facilitated the regulation of treatment parameters to achieve the precise PDT for cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: The study evaluated the potential of apple aroma to alleviate physiological stress response induced by a short-term cognitive stressor. It investigated the effects of apple aroma on cardiac and peripheral autonomic nervous system activity under stressful conditions. METHODS: Within-subject experiments were conducted with 25 healthy male university students with a 30-minute calculation task under three conditions: Apple, Chamomile (CHA), and Di propylene glycol (DPG) (scentless air). The aroma administration was precisely controlled and counterbalanced. Cardiac activity on electrocardiograms and nose tip temperature were recorded throughout the experiment. A visual analog scale and a scent questionnaire were subjective measures. RESULTS: Apple aroma demonstrated a significantly smaller increase in heart rate (t [24]\u2009=\u20093.36, p\u2009=\u20090.008 vs. DPG, t [24]\u2009=\u20094.06, p\u2009=\u20090.001 vs. CHA), and a decrease in the high-frequency component of heart rate variability (t [24]\u2009=\u20092.81, p\u2009=\u20090.029 vs. DPG, t [24]\u2009=\u20093.48, p\u2009=\u20090.006 vs. CHA) compared to the other conditions, representing a smaller enhancement of cardiac sympathetic nervous system activity and smaller suppression of cardiac parasympathetic nervous system activity respectively. CONCLUSION: Apple aroma showed efficacy in alleviating the physiological stress response in terms of cardiac activity. Apple was also considered significantly preferable and comfortable compared to the other conditions, which would be beneficial in the context of aromatherapy.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Today, with the development of critical patient care and the increase in intravascular invasive methods, the survival rate of patients diagnosed with hematological and solid organ malignancies is increasing, and unfortunately, the incidence of Candida parapsilosis candidemia is also increasing due to multiple risk factors. In this study, we aimed to determine the clinical-demographic characteristics of C. parapsilosis candidemia and the antifungal susceptibility profile of C. parapsilosis in pediatric patients with hematological and solid organ malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study included pediatric patients with hematologic and solid organ malignancies presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with candidemia, in whom C. parapsilosis was isolated from blood and catheter cultures between January 2010 and August 2023. RESULTS: Thirty (65.2%) of the patients had hematologic and 16 (34.8%) had solid organ malignancies. In all patients, 23 (50%) had non-catheter-related candidemia and 23 (50%) had catheter-related candidemia. At least one of the risk factors examined was detected in these patients. Catheter-related candidemia was found to be more common in patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancy. The difference was found to be statistically significant (p= 0.030). Drug resistance rates of C. parapsilosis were 6.5% for amphotericin B, 6.5% for fluconazole, 2.2% for voriconazole and 2.2% for micafungin. No patient with caspofungin resistance was detected. The mean treatment duration of the patients was 21 days (min 3-max 103) and it was observed that amphotericin B and caspofungin were used most frequently in the treatment regimen. The mortality rate of patients with candidemia was 6.5%. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that patients with hematologic malignancies exhibited a higher susceptibility to catheter-related C. parapsilosis candidemia compared to patients with solid organ tumors. Caspofungin resistance was not detected in our study, and we believe that each center should know its own antifungal drug sensitivity, determine the treatment regimen accordingly, and that catheters should be removed rapidly in patients with catheter-related C. parapsilosis candidemia in malignant patients.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the more common rare disorders, and its atypical/segmental or mosaic forms are underdiagnosed. Thus far, only a few dozen cases of localized mosaic neurofibromatosis have undergone combined germline and somatic genetic testing for the NF1 gene. METHODS: A 65-year-old female patient was referred to our center for multiple neurofibromas on her right shoulder, with a clinical diagnosis of localized mosaic neurofibromatosis. One of the neurofibromas was surgically removed. Massively parallel sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were utilized to identify the germline and somatic variants in the NF1 gene. RESULTS: The heterozygous pathogenic NF1 gene variant c.7549C>T and multiple heterozygous intragenic NF1 gene deletions were detected in the DNA taken from the shoulder neurofibroma, but not in the DNA from blood leukocytes or buccal smear. STUDY LIMITATIONS: The healthy skin around neurofibromas was not analyzed due to limited available material. CONCLUSION: Germline and somatic genetic testing in localized forms of neurofibromatosis are advisable since this facilitates proper genetic counseling regarding risks to offspring, who could inherit a germline pathogenic variant. Another important point to consider is cancer surveillance, which is often underutilized in mosaic forms of neurofibromatosis.",

        "AbstractText": "Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a key diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), interacting with Wnt and Hippo/YAP pathways related to cancer proliferation. Modulating GPC3 gene expression can induce liver cancer cell death by disrupting growth factor signaling, cell adhesion, and metabolic regulation. This study presents the development of a non-viral ultralarge porous CRISPR-Cas9 silica nano-depot to perform targeted GPC3 genome editing for the treatment of HCC. The synthesized ultralarge porous silica nano-depot (UPSND) encapsulates substantial CRISPR-Cas9-ribonucleoprotein complexes with a remarkable 98.3% loading efficiency. The UPSND-mediated GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9 therapy significantly suppresses cancer cell proliferation by modulating the Wnt and Hippo/YAP pathways. The efficiency of GPC3 gene deletion is observed to be 5.1-fold higher than that of commercial lipid-based GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9 in both human and murine genes, with minimal off-target effects. In vivo systemic administration of GPC3 Cas9-RNP@UPSND resulted in preferential accumulation within hepatic tissues in orthotopic HCC mouse models, leading to complete tumor eradication and enhancing T-cell tumor-infiltration. Furthermore, the GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9@UPSND treatment exhibits superior anti-proliferative efficacy in tumor-growth prevention compared to Codrituzumab, as evidenced by the analysis of Ki67 and GPC3 expression, along with serum GPC3 levels. These findings underscore the translational potential of the non-viral UPSND nanoplatform-based CRISPR GPC3 genome editing, offering a promising targeted therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.",

A prefabricated long skin tube formed by a combination of tensor fascia lata and anterolateral thigh flaps was transferred to the ruined anterior chest with vascular anastomosis, with the oral intake achieved in all three patients. The prefabrication reinforced the vascularity of the long conduit by the delay effect. The prefabrication included skin grafting on the resultant raw surface; hence, another free flap to seal the longitudinal suture line of the conduit was avoided. Furthermore, the viability of the conduit was easily monitored with the previously grafted skin. However, if a high-positioned jejunostomy is unavailable, an additional free skin tube might be necessary. Postoperative leakage is quite frequent due to these patients' poor general and local conditions. Therefore, sparing large local flaps or pedicled musculocutaneous flaps around both the oral and anal anastomoses for repairing the fistula is important.",

The properties of bio-synthesized Palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) were characterized using UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, HRTEM and XRD. The HRTEM, SAED and XRD analysis showed that the crystalline monodispersed non-uniformly spherical nanoparticles were within a size range below 27\u00a0nm. Energy dispersive spectra (EDS) confirmed the elemental composition and FTIR analysis suggested the role of water-soluble polyols present in the P. granatum extract in mediating the synthesis of PdNPs. The PdNPs were evaluated for biomedical properties including in vitro antimicrobial, antioxidant activities along with both in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer properties. The study showed efficacy and MIC of the crude P. granatum peel extract and PdNPs as antimicrobial agents against S. aureus and C. albicans. In vitro anti-oxidant assay demonstrated enhanced scavenging activity of PdNPs. In vitro anticancer activity of PdNPs against A549 and MCF7 cells showed reduced viability of 43% and 32% respectively.

In this study, lichens Bactrospora myriadea and Arthonia antillarum, collected from the mangroves of Negombo Lagoon in Sri Lanka, were examined to identify their associated ELFs. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, and Xylaria feejeensis were isolated from B. myriadea, while Xylaria psidii, Daldinia eschscholtzii, and Nodulisporium sp. were obtained from A. antillarum. The ethyl acetate extracts of these ELFs were screened for cytotoxic activity against the MCF-7 cell line, with P. chrysosporium extract showing potent cytotoxicity. The purified compounds from this extract were identified as spirolaxine (1), phanerosporic acid (2), and 5-(14-hydroxypentadecyl)-resorcinol (3). Their structures were determined using Fourier Transform Infrared, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy and Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution mass spectrometry, while their absolute configurations were established through circular dichroism and time-dependent density functional theory calculations. The compounds demonstrated moderate cytotoxic activity against human breast (MCF-7), oral (CAL-27), and lung (A549) cancer cell lines. Compound 1 exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity against oral cancer, with an IC50 value of 10.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\u00a0\u00b5M.

Patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome require rigorous thyroid function detection, monitoring, and correction over time. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical presentations and thyroid dysfunction in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. METHODS: An observational study was done in patients with polycystic ovarian disease presenting to a tertiary care centre over six months, from December 2023 to May 2024 Total population sampling was done. All the women during the study period diagnosed with polycystic ovarian disease based on Rotterdam criteria were included in the study after getting ethical approval from the institutional review board. (Reference number: 20102023/03). RESULTS: The mean age of women in the study was 24.74\u00b15.01 years. A total of 28 (31.46%) patients of polycystic ovarian disease had hyperthyriodism, hypothyroidism was found in 13 (14.60%) and subclinical hypothyroidism was found in 6 (6.74%) patients.

        "ArticleTitle": "Severe Relapsing Hailey-Hailey Disease Displaying a Durable Complete Response to Hydroxyurea.",
        "AbstractText": "Familial benign chronic pemphigus, also known as Hailey-Hailey disease, was first described by the Hailey brothers in 1939 (1). It represents a chronic autosomal-dominant genetic skin disorder with incomplete penetrance, usually diagnosed in children and young adults. As a result, family history of this disorder can be elicited in only about 66% of patients. We describe herein a patient with Hailey-Hailey disease who received treatment with hydroxyurea for a new diagnosis of polycythemia vera, with a surprising outcome. A 54-year-old man was diagnosed with Hailey-Hailey disease at age ten when he presented with several erythematous and blistering skin lesions involving the neck, wrist flexure surfaces, and the forearms. The patient underwent regular dermatology follow-up for this condition. His disease followed a relapsing-remitting pattern, with short disease-free intervals. It predominantly involved the neck, torso, and upper extremities (Figure 1), and only rarely buttocks and groin areas. Initially, mild-moderate potency topical steroid creams were tried, with only modest success. Topical antibiotics were required on several occasions due to secondary infections. Photodynamic therapy was only minimally helpful, as the disease continued to worsen. In his 40s, the disease became more difficult to manage, and several systemic options were tried, with very little if any success. Thus, the patient failed oral steroids, dapsone and azathioprine. He became anxious, depressed, and socially isolated. Other past medical history was significant for hypertension. The patient was a never-smoker, and denied alcohol or drug abuse. There was no family history of skin disorders of cancers in his immediate family members. In May 2019, the patient presented with elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit and moderate thrombocytosis. Further work-up identified JAK-2 V617F kinase mutated polycythemia vera, for which he was started on periodic phlebotomies and low-dose aspirin. Four months later, hydroxyurea was prescribed due to increased phlebotomy needs and worsening thrombocytosis. The hydroxyurea dose was subsequently titrated to 1000 mg orally per day, alternating with 1500 mg orally per day. The patient tolerated this agent well, without significant side-effects. He also achieved excellent control of hematocrit and normalization of platelet count. Pleasantly surprised, the patient also realized that he had not experienced any more relapsing Hailey-Hailey skin lesions 8 weeks after the commencement of hydroxyurea. Four years later, his polycythemia remains in excellent control. He also remains without any further evidence of skin lesions. The hallmark of Hailey-Hailey disease is believed to be the haploinsufficiency of the enzyme ATP2C1 (2). The ATP2C1 gene is located on chromosome 3 and encodes a Ca2+ ATPase protein. A mutation in one copy of the gene causes only half of this necessary protein to be synthesized. Consequently, impaired keratinocyte adhesion ensues, leading to acantholysis, blisters, and rash (2). The initial lesion may be an erythematous area or a fluid-filled blister which subsequently ruptures, leading to a macerated or crusted lesion. The lesions more commonly affect the sides of the neck, armpits, forearms, buttocks and groins, but may expand to a generalized skin eruption. Patients may complain of itching in the affected areas, potentially leading to social distress and isolation (3). Affected areas undergo repeated blistering and inflammation, and may be tender to touch. A pattern of multiple relapses and remissions is characteristic of Hailey-Hailey disease. Nonetheless, most lesions are transient and leave little or no scars (Figure 2). The differential diagnosis includes intertrigo, contact dermatitis, pemphigus, psoriasis, and cutaneous candidiasis. Skin biopsy and/or family history can confirm the diagnosis of Hailey-Hayley disease. The lack of both mucosal lesions and intercellular antibodies on immunohistochemistry distinguishes this entity from other forms of pemphigus. Hailey-Hayley disease is currently believed to be incurable, and its complications include secondary bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, which may require antimicrobial agents (4). The patients are advised to avoid friction and sweating by wearing light cotton clothes. Sun avoidance as much as possible and using SPF 50 sunscreen while in the sun are advised. Applying soothing compresses followed by topical corticosteroid cream can offer symptom relief (3,4). Topical antibiotics can be used for localized lesions. Generalized lesions may require systemic steroids and antibiotics. Topical tacrolimus, laser, and photodynamic therapy have been used with varying degrees of success in the second line (4). Oral dapsone, cyclosporine, azathioprine, thalidomide, etretinate, and intramuscular alefacept were shown to control the mild-moderate disease but not severe chronic or relapsing forms (4). Surgical skin grafting usually represents the last resort in resistant localized disease. Mestre et al. (5) described a case of chronic Hailey-Hailey disease in a Caucasian woman, whose skin lesions were refractory to topical and oral steroids, tetracyclines, antifungals, and azathioprine. After introduction of weekly oral methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis treatment, the skin lesions regressed, with significant impact on the patient's quality of life. Similarly, Hailey-Hailey disease in our patient responded completely to hydroxyurea, without any relapses over a 4-year interval. Hydroxyurea has been used for many decades in hematology and oncology, has a favorable side-effect profile, and is cost-effective. Our case report supports the clinical evidence of hydroxyurea's potential role in Hailey-Hailey disease treatment. There is hope that our findings will be confirmed by larger studies and shift the treatment paradigm in severe chronic or relapsing-remitting forms of Hailey-Hailey disease.",

No significant statistical correlation was found between PSA levels, ISUP score, and distant metastasis verification. CONCLUSION: Broader use of PSMA PET/CT in primary staging of high-risk prostate cancer patients could allow for more precise, personalized therapy in the future.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A New Metric for Measuring Locational Health Access for Cancer Treatment.",
        "AbstractText": "Ensuring access to cancer treatment facilities is essential for delivering timely care, yet various barriers such as geographic distance, socioeconomic factors, and social disparities can impede access in rural and urban regions. This study measured locational health access for colorectal cancer in the context of hospitals and population distribution in Louisiana. It used data of census tracts, hospital beds and providers, from the National Cancer Institute. By mapping the distribution of these healthcare facilities, the study revealed the potential of identifying significant challenges in accessing specialized cancer care. There is no existing locational health access metric in this domain. The contribution of this paper is that it meticulously calculated the actual road distance of each census tract centroid and each cancer-treating hospital, and offers a new locational health access metric. This metric considers the number of beds and number of oncologists, as a proxy for measurement of cancer treatment facilities. The significance of this work is that it can be applied in a larger scope (such as the country), with more variables, and for other diseases treated by hospitals. It has public policy implications; hospitals can be located through such data-driven analysis.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Women living with HIV (WLWH) are six times more likely to develop cervical cancer (CC). There is also an increased incidence of CC in women with optimal HIV disease control, despite immune reconstitution due to antiretroviral therapy (ART). OBJECTIVES: This study describes the prevalence and age-specific genotype distribution of hrHPV among an urban cohort of WLWH. Additionally, we report the HIV disease profile and age-specific outcomes of hrHPV DNA screening in WLWH attending routine CC screening at Newlands Clinic, Harare, between January and December 2021. METHOD: This was a descriptive cross-sectional design based on a retrospective review of records of WLWH who were screened for hrHPV infection. We assessed the prevalence of hrHPV infection during the study period. RESULTS: We included data for 2745 women who had an hrHPV DNA test. The median age at the time of testing was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR]; 37-52) The median duration on HIV ART was 10.2 years (IQR: 6.2-13.3). The proportion of women with undetectable viral loads (< 50 copies/mL) was 91.2%. The prevalence of hrHPV infection was 53%. The most prevalent genotypes were human papillomavirus (HPV) 58 (11%), HPV 52 (10%), HPV 35 (10%), and HPV 16 (9%). CONCLUSION: Our study reports a high prevalence of HPV and hrHPV including other subtypes than 16 and 18. These results highlight the continued importance of CC screening and prophylactic HPV vaccinations among WLWH.",

        "AbstractText": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors have a poor effect in treating ovarian cancer, and the specific mechanism is unknown. The purpose of this research was to investigate the impact of XPR1 on controlling autophagy in ovarian cancer. The findings suggested an increase in XPR1 expression in ovarian cancer tissues. The elevated level of its expression was linked to the stage of ovarian cancer, as well as overall survival and progression-free survival. XPR1 enhanced the growth and spread of ovarian cancer while suppressing autophagy. Moreover, XPR1 suppressed autophagy flux by interacting with LAMP1 and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. XPR1 controlled the positioning and production of MHC-I molecules on the surfaces of ovarian cancer cells via autophagy. Silencing XPR1 combined with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine significantly inhibited tumor growth in mouse ovarian cancer models. In conclusion, the findings indicate that XPR1 could serve as a promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. Combined autophagy inhibitors may improve the sensitivity of ovarian cancer immunotherapy.",

The mechanisms driving the transition from hepatitis to cirrhosis, and eventually, to HCC are unclear. This study aimed to clarify the metabolic changes that underly the progression of HCC and identify potential prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers. METHODS: This prospective study collected serum samples from patients with chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or HCC, hospitalized at the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, from December 2022 to December 2023. The samples were analyzed using non-targeted, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis modeling and t-tests were used to identify key differentially expressed metabolites associated with the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to determine the key metabolic pathways involved, while machine learning models were applied to identify the metabolite signatures. RESULTS: We identified 153 differentially expressed metabolites in the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC, many of which were involved in ammonia cycling or the metabolism of methylhistidine, alanine, arginine, proline, or betaine. We also identified L-histidine and adenosine as the metabolites that demonstrated significant sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing among the hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our study comprehensively characterized the metabolic profiles of the different stages of the hepatitis-cirrhosis-HCC transition. We showed that serum metabolite detection is a viable diagnostic tool for identifying and monitoring high-risk individuals, which could potentially be used to halt the development of HCC.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality on a global scale. A strong correlation has been found between COVID-19 treatment outcomes and noncommunicable diseases such as cancers. However, there is limited information on the outcomes of cancer patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an analysis on data collected in a large prospective cohort study set-up by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC). All patients with laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Cancer was defined as having a current solid organ or haematological malignancy. The following outcomes were assessed; 30-day in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospitalization and receipt of higher-level care. RESULTS: Of the 560,547 hospitalised individuals who were analysed, 27,243 (4.9%) had cancer. Overall, cancer patients were older and had more comorbidities than non-cancer patients. Patients with cancer had higher 30-day in-hospital mortality than non-cancer patients (29.1.3% vs 18.0%) and longer hospital stays (median of 12 days vs 8 days). However, patients with cancer were admitted less often to intensive care units than non-cancer patients (12.6% vs 17.1%) and received less invasive mechanical ventilation than non-cancer patients (4.5% vs 7.6%). The hazard ratio of dying from cancer, adjusted for age, sex and country income level was 1.18 (95%CI: 1.15-1.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings underscore the heightened vulnerability of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer, revealing a higher mortality rate, longer hospital stays, and an unstructured pattern of care that reflects the complexity of managing severely ill patients during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "ArticleTitle": "An Optimized Method for Single Cell Cloning of Human CAR-T Cells Based on FBS-Coated Plates.",
        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: T cell-based immunotherapy, especially chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, has emerged as an appropriate approach for treating hematologic malignancies and is currently under investigation in clinical trials for solid tumors. Despite significant improvements in CAR-T cell production processes, the isolation and expansion of CAR-engineered T cells continue to pose significant challenges. The aim of this research is to provide a simple and cost-effective method for the isolation and expansion of human CAR-T cells. This novel concept applies coated fetal bovine serum (FBS) culture plates and focuses on enhancing viability and functionality to improve the adherence of suspended T cells. METHODS: This study evaluated a two-dimensional (2D) culture technique for isolating the CAR-T cells that target prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) utilizing matrices pre-coated with 0.2% glutaraldehyde and FBS. Jurkat cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding the anti-PSMA CAR construct. FBS-coated and commercialized Matrigel-coated matrices were used for single-cell isolation and clonal expansion. Functional tests were conducted to assess the activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells and the IFN-\u03b3 release assay subsequent to cloning and expansion. RESULTS: Transfection efficiency markedly improved, with 88.4% of Lenti-X 293T cells demonstrating green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. Among the Jurkat cells, 57.1% showed GFP expression post-transduction, of which 34.1% showed surface expression of anti-PSMA CAR. Clonal expansion on the FBS-coated matrix proved effective, yielding 92.1% GFP-positive isolated cells. Functional assays demonstrated that CAR-T cells co-cultured with LNCaP cells exhibited significantly enhanced proliferation, activation (as indicated by CD69 and CD25 expression), and cytokine release assay (IFN-\u03b3) compared with those co-cultured with DU 145 and mock cells. CONCLUSION: This new approach is efficient, economical, and scalable for isolating specific homogenous T cells and promoting their clonal proliferation and expansion. Furthermore, this method improves T cell adherence, proliferation, and functional effectiveness, offering a potential foundation for advancing CAR-T cell therapies aimed at solid tumors. Future research should concentrate on optimizing culture conditions and testing this method in preclinical animal models to ensure its clinical applicability and efficacy.",

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Apoptosis and autophagy play critical roles in the survival and regulation of cancer cells, with key genes serving dual purposes in these processes. Arsenic trioxide (ATO), oxaliplatin (OXA), and docetaxel (DOC) are widely used in the treatment of various cancers. Specifically, ATO inhibits cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis in certain cancer cells, while OXA and DOC, common agents in cancer chemotherapy, continue to be actively studied for their potential therapeutic effects. METHODS: This study investigated the effects of ATO, DOC, and OXA on AGS and MKN-45 gastric cancer cell lines in vitro. The MTT assay was utilized to determine the effective concentrations of these compounds, both individually and in combination. Apoptosis was assessed using Annexin V-FITC staining, and the mRNA levels of genes related to autophagy and apoptosis were analyzed via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that the combination of ATO with DOC and OXA significantly reduced the viability of AGS and MKN-45 cells compared to DOC or OXA therapy alone. Notably, the simultaneous administration of all three agents markedly enhanced apoptosis induction. Additionally, the combined use of two drugs showed a more pronounced impact on both cell necrosis and apoptosis compared to the effects of each drug used alone. CONCLUSION: The combination of two therapeutic agents represents a promising strategy for inducing autophagy and gene expression related to apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. This approach exerted a more substantial influence on cell apoptosis and necrosis than single-drug treatments, underscoring its potential as an effective therapeutic option.",

Vorinostat (VOR) is a chemotherapeutic drug that has been utilized for treatment of breast cancer, but its effectiveness is limited due to low bioavailability and several side effects. The primary aim of this study is to prepare folic acid conjugated pegylated bilosomes containing VOR (FA-PEG- bilosomes) for the selective targeting of breast cancer cells with the FA receptor expression. Accordingly, lithocholic acid was used as a bile acid in bilosomes due to its anti-cancer and anti-proliferation effects. METHODS: VOR loaded bilosomes were prepared using the thin-film hydration method and optimized by applying two-level fractional factorial design. Various properties of the considered bilosomes, including particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PdI), encapsulation efficiency (EE) % and drug loading (DL) %, were then investigated and synthesized FA-PEG-Cholesterol was incorporated in the optimized bilosomes. The anti-cancer efficacy of VOR loaded FA-PEG- bilosomes was also evaluated in vitro using the MCF-7 and 4T1 breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, drug free FA-PEG-bilosomes and bilosomes were evaluated for biocompatibility in the L929 cell line. RESULTS: The optimized VOR loaded bilosomes exhibited spherical particles with the size of 305.33\u00b118.50 nm, PdI of 0.37\u00b10.03, zeta potential of -17.66\u00b10.15 mV, EE of 92.91\u00b10.22 % and DL% of 23.64\u00b10.04%. Incorporation of FA-PEG-cholesterol in nanobilosomes increased the particle size and absolute value of zeta potential. In vitro cytotoxicity study also revealed that VOR loaded FA- PEG-bilosomes demonstrated a greater cytotoxic effect, as compared to the free VOR and VOR- bilosomes in both MCF-7 and 4T1 cancer cells. CONCLUSION: This showed that FA- PEG-bilosomes could be a promising formulation for the treatment of FA (+) tumors.",

This study aimed to evaluate a modified approach for laparoscopic ultrasonography to enhance surgical outcomes. METHODS: Between January 2020 and August 2023, 122 patients who underwent real-time ultrasound-guided laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled and divided into modified and traditional ultrasonography groups. The modified ultrasound application comprised intraoperative protocol-based laparoscopic ultrasonography comprising application scenarios; standardized positions for the surgeon, trocar, and probe; and the resulting standardized sections for various laparoscopic liver resections. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were compared between the two groups. Subgroup analysis was performed and comprised techniques for modified duct structure identification and portal vein branch puncture; both techniques were used in fluorescence probe-mounted laparoscopic liver resection using negative and positive staining procedures, respectively. RESULTS: The traditional and modified groups comprised 64 and 58 patients, respectively. The patients' background characteristics were not significantly different between the groups. Surgical duration (283.4\u00a0min vs. 225.1\u00a0min; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Pringle maneuver duration (47.4\u00a0min vs. 39.5\u00a0min; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), bleeding volume (258.6\u00a0mL vs. 174.8\u00a0mL; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), overall complication rate (31.3% vs. 15.5%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.041), and postoperative stay were significantly greater in the traditional vs. modified ultrasonography groups, respectively.

However, the tool used to determine which patients likely benefit most from this treatment strategy has not been reported. We sought to develop a prognostic scoring system based on tumor burden score (TBS) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to predict the long-term prognosis of uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies. METHODS: Data on patients with uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies from multiple centers were collected. The prognostic accuracy of TBS, AFP, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), and CTA (Combined TBS and AFP) for 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 278 patients with uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies were enrolled, including 48 BCLC-B and 230 BCLC-C HCC patients. CTA (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.721 and 0.683) outperformed TBS (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.680 and 0.621), AFP (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.606 and 0.594), and BCLC staging (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.551 and 0.555) in predicting PFS and OS. The 2-year PFS and OS for low CTA (low TBS/low AFP) were 65.7% and 94.4%, respectively, which were significantly higher than 21.6% and 44.9% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), respectively, for intermediate CTA (low TBS/high AFP or high TBS/low AFP) and 8.7% and 12.1% (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), respectively, for high CTA (high TBS/high AFP). Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that CTA grading was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS (referent: low CTA; intermediate CTA, HR 2.87 and 7.17; high CTA, HR 5.52 and 10.31, respectively).

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Gallbladder polyps (GPs) are protrusions of the gallbladder wall into the lumen, and are commonly detected during ultrasound examinations. Traditional management of multiple GPs (MGPs) has been conservative, including lifestyle interventions, regular monitoring, and surgical intervention in certain cases, but this approach poses risks of polyps enlargement and increase of number, as well as patients' psychological burdens. Danning Tablets, a traditional Chinese medicine, have emerged as a potential non-surgical treatment for GPs, showing promise in reducing polyp size and alleviating symptoms, backed by their anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties demonstrated in preclinical studies. This suggests the need for further research into Danning Tablets as an alternative treatment for MGPs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label trial. The study will be conducted across multiple centres specializing in gastroenterology and hepatology. Participants will be recruited from these centres, ensuring a diverse patient demographic. Adult patients diagnosed with MGPs, based on ultrasound findings, will be included. Exclusion criteria include patients with a history of gallbladder cancer, previous gallbladder surgery, or serious comorbid conditions. The control group will receive standard care, including dietary and lifestyle advice, while the intervention group will receive Danning Tablets and standard care. The dosage and administration of Danning Tablets will follow established clinical guidelines. The primary outcome will be the change in size of the largest gallbladder polyps on week 24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01, measured by ultrasound. The secondary outcomes will include symptom improvement and recording of any adverse events.

This study aimed to propose a new model to predict the risk of PCs after head and neck surgery with FFR. A retrospective analysis was performed on 528 patients undergoing head and neck surgery with FFR between March 2020 and June 2022 in a tertiary head and neck centre. All information assessed included patient characteristics, tumour, laboratory, and surgical and anaesthetic factors. The primary outcome was a composite of severe non-surgical PCs during hospitalisation. All patients were grouped into those with PCs and those without PCs. Based on univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, a model to predict the risk of PCs was constructed and validated with bootstrap resampling. The incidence of PCs was 23.30% (123/528). Five predictors of PCs were identified: age, flap size, blood loss, maximum lactic acid value, and type of airway. The model incorporating these variables had moderate predictive discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.69 to 0.79) for PCs, and maintained satisfactory calibration performance (Brier score of 0.157). Meanwhile, the model demonstrated satisfactory clinical significance.

        "AbstractText": "Currently, the prognosis for patients with advanced bladder cancer remains poor, with only a minority being sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors. There is a need to develop additional treatment strategies. Microwave therapy, as a promising approach for some inoperable tumors, still faces challenges such as limited efficacy and high recurrence rates. Additionally, the cell damage and necrosis induced by conventional microwave treatment only act as weak immunostimulatory factors for antitumor immunity, failing to activate effective antitumor immune responses. Recent discoveries have shown that inducing pyroptosis can provide a good opportunity for enhancing systemic immune responses and alleviating immune suppression in cancer therapy. Here, we have developed Mn-ZrMOF@DAC, a microwave-sensitized nanoparticle loaded with the DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine. The Mn-ZrMOF@DAC can enhance the effect of microwave thermal therapy and generate reactive oxygen species under microwave irradiation, causing thermal and oxidative damage to cancer cells. Furthermore, there was an important up-regulation of the key pyroptosis protein GSDME, with a marked increase in pyroptotic cell numbers. In\u00a0vivo experiments demonstrated that mice injected with Mn-ZrMOF@DAC nanoparticles followed by microwave radiation treatment exhibited potent antitumor effects and enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy.

        "ArticleTitle": "Fast Bayesian Inference for Spatial Mean-Parameterized Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Models.",
        "AbstractText": "Count data with complex features arise in many disciplines, including ecology, agriculture, criminology, medicine, and public health. Zero inflation, spatial dependence, and non-equidispersion are common features in count data. There are currently two classes of models that allow for these features-the mode-parameterized Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COMP) distribution and the generalized Poisson model. However both require the use of either constraints on the parameter space or a parameterization that leads to challenges in interpretability. We propose spatial mean-parameterized COMP models that retain the flexibility of these models while resolving the above issues. We use a Bayesian spatial filtering approach in order to efficiently handle high-dimensional spatial data and we use reversible-jump MCMC to automatically choose the basis vectors for spatial filtering. The COMP distribution poses two additional computational challenges-an intractable normalizing function in the likelihood and no closed-form expression for the mean. We propose a fast computational approach that addresses these challenges by, respectively, introducing an efficient auxiliary variable algorithm and pre-computing key approximations for fast likelihood evaluation. We illustrate the application of our methodology to simulated and real datasets, including Texas HPV-cancer data and US vaccine refusal data.

METHODS: A 79-year-old male with prostate cancer was treated with docetaxel and subsequently developed progressively worsening blurred vision. Prior to initiation of docetaxel therapy, his best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in the right and left eye. He presented to clinic 5 months after the initiation of docetaxel therapy with BCVA of 20/70 and 20/40 -2 in the right and left eye, respectively. Fundoscopic exam was notable for bilateral focal central areas of macular hyperpigmentation. Toxic maculopathy secondary to docetaxel was suspected and the recommendation to discontinue docetaxel was made to the oncologist. RESULTS: Five months after discontinuation of docetaxel, the patient's BCVA improved to 20/40 -2 in the right and left eye. Fundoscopic exam was stable in both eyes. CONCLUSION: Bilateral pigmentary maculopathy presenting as focal areas of macular hyperpigmentation developed after initiation of docetaxel in an adult with no previous ocular history.

        "AbstractText": "As a novel drug development paradigm, selective activation of prodrugs provides the potential for precise tumor chemotherapy, thereby presenting an opportunity for advancing cancer treatment. The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and prodrug can enhance the therapeutic efficacy while simultaneously enabling real-time monitoring of drug distribution and release. However, the tumor hypoxia microenvironment and the frequent high-dose administration of prodrugs significantly impede therapeutic efficacy and escalate treatment-related risks. Herein, a tumor microenvironment-specific release prodrug is constructed, termed NBS-2S-5FU. Under the influence of glutathione (GSH), NBS-2S-5FU undergoes activation, leading to the release of photosensitizer NBS and chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU derivatives. Under irradiation, NBS produces sufficient superoxide radical (   O 2 - \u2022     ) while 5-FU derivatives inhibit DNA biosynthesis, thereby effectively suppressing tumor growth at low doses. Subsequent in vivo studies utilizing NBS-2S-5FU liposomes exhibit outstanding anti-cancer effectiveness. This study highlights a promising direction for advancing combined prodrugs that integrate PDT and chemotherapy.",

Disorders of the organelle networks are associated with multiple pathological processes. However, clearly and intuitively visualizing the highly dynamic interactions between ultrafine organelles is challenging. Fluorescence imaging technology provides opportunities due to the distinct advantages of facile, non-invasiveness and dynamic detection, making it particularly well-suited for applications in uncovering the mysterious veil of organelle interactions. Regrettably, the lack of ideal fluorescence agents has always been an obstacle in imaging the intricate behaviors of organelles. In this review, we provide a systematic discussion on the existing dual-color and dual-targetable molecular sensors used in monitoring organelle interactions, with a specific focus on their targeting strategies, imaging mechanisms and biological applications. Additionally, the current limitations and future development directions of dual-targetable probes and dual-emissives are briefly discussed.

        "AbstractText": "With recent changes in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) practices, such as the increasing use of alternative donors and ex vivo T-cell depletion, how various risk factors interplay and affect the timeline of infections have not been well elucidated. We retrospectively reviewed the first 100 consecutive HSCT from April 2019 to October 2021 in the only pediatric HSCT center in Hong Kong. We found that the vast majority of the allogeneic transplant recipients (69/74, 93.2%) had infections after HSCT, amongst which bacterial, viral, and fungal infection rates were 35.1%, 90.5%, and 9.5%, respectively. In contrast, only 30.8% (8/26) of autologous transplant recipients had infections (rate of bacterial, viral, and fungal infection were 19.2%, 15.4%, and 3.8%, respectively). Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and BK virus (BKV) typically occurred early after HSCT, adenovirus (ADV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) thereafter, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) throughout the entire 2.5-year observation period. Ex vivo T-cell depletion was a general risk factor for viral infection with HHV-6 (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a03.03), BKV (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.36), CMV (HR\u00a0=\u00a04.45), and EBV (HR\u00a0=\u00a07.15); all p\u00a0<\u00a00.02.

The development of precise and rapid imaging technologies to monitor PSMA is crucial for early diagnosis and therapy. Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) has emerged as a powerful tool for real-time tracking and in vivo visualization, offering high sensitivity and resolution.

The present study is intended to analyze the concentrations of twenty elements (Al, Sb, Ca, Se, Cd, Fe, Hg, As, Zn, Mn, Na, Li, Cu, Co, Mg, Sr, Ni, K, Cr and Pb) in the serum of BPH (n\u2009=\u2009188) and PC (n\u2009=\u2009217) patients and in comparison with controls (n\u2009=\u2009233). Nitric acid-perchloric acid mixture was used for serum digestion followed by determination of the metals/metalloid by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. This study elucidates the imbalances of the elements with BPH/PC patients and healthy subjects. For multiple comparisons, Bonferroni test was applied and principal component analysis was performed for measuring the multiple metals/metalloid exposure. Mean concentrations of Al, Cr, Pb, Cd, Na, Ni and K were found higher significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in the serum of BPH patients compared with healthy controls, while average levels of Sb, Al, Cd, As, Mn, Sr, K and Pb were significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) elevated in PC patients than controls. The correlation patterns revealed significantly different mutual associations among the metals/metalloid in patients as compared to controls. Multivariate statistical methods showed substantially divergent grouping of the metals/metalloid for both groups of patients and healthy controls. Significant variations in the elements levels were also detected in various PC types (small cell prostate, transitional cell, squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinoma) and PC stages. Significant differences in the metals/metalloid levels were also noted with abode, dietary and smoking habits of donor groups.

Targeting cancer cells metabolism is one of the key strategies for controlling the growth of cancer cells. D-Mannoheptulose (MH) (as Phytotherapy) a specific inhibitor, belonging to hexokinase category, to inhibit glycolysis pathway and Doxorubicin (DXR) (as Chemotherapy) has cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and anti-cancer effects by inducing apoptosis. Evaluating the effect of D-Mannoheptulose and Doxorubicin on the normal and breast cancer cell line by determining their anti-tumor activities. Cell culture of normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and MCF-7 cell line were achieved by using Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) and RPMI-1640 Medium. D-Mannoheptulose, and Doxorubicin stock and diluted solutions were prepared by using phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) respectively. HMECs and MCF7 cell line were treated with MH, and DXR, cytotoxicity ratio was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT). The findings of study indicated a substantial increase in the cytotoxicity and antiproliferative effects of MH and DXR depending on the concentration gradient against breast cancer cell lines and IC50 values, while on the other hand, there was no significant cytotoxic effect on normal cells. Results of the study revealed that MH, DXR, can result in inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cell lines. This behaviour was mainly due to the increase in cytotoxicity through inhibiting the glycolysis pathway thereby resulting in apoptosis. This further lead to the decrease in HK activity and hence pyruvate as well as ATP amount. Overall, DXR and MH treatment display effective cytotoxic effects against the studied breast cancer cell lines.",

Thymol is found in the herb thyme and has been reported to have potential anticancer properties. We aimed to explore the effects of thymol on the efficacy of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment in an in vitro model of EC. We evaluated the synergistic effects of thymol with 5-FU using cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle analysis, scratch wound healing assay, gelatin zymography, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation\u00a0aproaches. The results indicated that thymol significantly decreased the viability of KYSE-30 cells in a time and dose-dependently. However, thymol had a minimal cytotoxic effect against normal fibroblasts. In addition, thymol significantly increased the chemosensitivity of EC KYSE-30 cells to 5-FU by promoting early and late apoptosis, inducing Sub-G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest, and increasing ROS generation. Combination therapy of thymol with 5-FU also resulted in an increased expression of p53 and Bax, decreased expression of Bcl2, reduced activity of MMP-2, and reduced cell migration compared to single therapies. These findings suggest that thymol has the potential to promote the anticancer potency of 5-FU chemotherapy and inhibit metastasis.

The biological activities of the complexes are influenced by a range of factors, including the identity of the ligands coordinated to the tin ion and the heteroatoms contained in them. Additionally, stabilizing the bonds between the tin atom and the ligand impacts the effectiveness of organotin complexes as biologically active molecules. This study involves the synthesis of new metal complexes and their evaluation for cytotoxic and apoptotic effects against human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The reaction of cephalexin and 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde in boiling methanol gave the corresponding Schiff base in a good yield. Subsequently, the reactions of disubstituted (methyl, butyl, and phenyl) tin chlorides and the Schiff base in boiling methanol produced the corresponding organotin(IV) complexes in high yields. The effect of the synthesized organotin complexes on MCF-7 was assessed. Based on the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) results, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay proved that all the organotin complexes effectively suppressed cancer growth. The dibutyl derivative of the three complexes tested had higher anticancer activity against MCF-7 cells than the dimethyl and diphenyl compounds. The IC50 values for the synthesized tin complexes ranged between 95 and 71\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Based on the concentration of the complex, a high content screening technique (HCS) assay showed a decrease in MCF-7 cell line cell viability.

A case-control study was conducted to assess the association between FHC and CRC risk in Kashmir, India, with a detailed analysis of epidemiological data and information on multiple gene polymorphisms. We collected detailed information on FHC and a number of socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, and also obtained blood samples for genetic analysis from 246 histopathologically confirmed CRC cases and 246 individually matched controls. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The study participants diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibited a robust correlation with a positive family history of CRC. In terms of gender-based analysis, it was observed that males with CRC and a family history of CRC had an odds ratio of 16.45 (95% CI; 2.14-126.26), whereas females exhibited an odds ratio of 4.11 (95% CI; 0.84-20.03). Furthermore, individuals with affected parents showed an almost fivefold increase (OR\u2009=\u20094.70, 95% CI: 0.98-1.06), underscoring the substantial association. Our study unveiled significant correlations between Xenobiotic gene variants and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).

We tested the diagnostic performance of the free PSA ratio (%fPSA) in detecting clinically significant cancer (CSC) in patients with PI-RADS <3 and PSA \u226410 ng/ml. METHODS: We analyzed 1435 prostate biopsies performed by a single operator between April 2018 and January 2023 at a single institution. PSA and free PSA results on the day of biopsy or within 1 month were used, and all biopsies were performed after prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CSC was defined as Gleason grade group \u22652. RESULTS: Among 208 men with PI-RADS <3 and PSA \u226410 ng/ml, CSC was detected in 37 (17.8%) patients. The median age was 65 years (interquartile range [IQR] 61-71), with a median PSA level of 5.06 ng/ml (IQR 3.98-7.08) and a median %fPSA of 18.2% (IQR 13.7-22.0). The area under the curve was 0.757 (95% confidence interval, 0.674-0.841), with a %fPSA cutoff of 17.6%, sensitivity of 86.5%, specificity of 63.7%, positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 2.38, and negative LR of 0.21. CSC was diagnosed in 5 out of 114 patients (4%) with %fPSA >17.6%, compared to 32 out of 94 patients (34%) with %fPSA <17.6%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PI-RADS <3 and PSA \u226410 ng/ml, %fPSA values < 17.6% may facilitate early prostate cancer diagnosis in those who might not undergo biopsy based on MRI results alone. Additionally, unnecessary biopsies could be avoided in patients with elevated PSA levels when %fPSA exceeds 17.6%.",

We performed a retrospective analysis focusing on patient demographics (age, BMI, diabetes status), biopsy parameters, and outcomes of sepsis and urinary tract infection . Patients were recorded as developing sepsis if they required hospital admission for intravenous antibiotics. Fisher's exact test was employed for categorical variables, while the Student's t test was utilized for continuous variables for statistical significance. RESULTS: The rate of sepsis was 3.9% in the ciprofloxacin-only group, versus 0% in the ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin group (P value = 0.03). Overall aggregated post-TRUS infection rates was also 0% in the ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin group (P value = 0.005). We found no associated between infection and secondary risk factors. CONCLUSION: The administration of 2 mg/kg intravenous gentamicin with oral ciprofloxacin prophylaxis reduces infection and sepsis rates post TRUS biopsy.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Use versus nonuse of antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to transperineal prostate biopsy: a propensity score-matched analysis.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Transperineal prostate biopsy offers advantage over a transrectal approach by reducing the risk of infectious complications. However, the necessity for antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) before a transperineal prostate biopsy is less clear. This study aimed to study the rate of infectious complications following transperineal prostate biopsy with or without AP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Propensity score matching was done for 1,273 patients who underwent transperineal prostate biopsy between October 2020 and October 2024 to adjust for differences in covariates. Parameters including the rate of urinary tract infection (UTI) requiring or not requiring hospitalization between patients who received AP and those who did not receive AP were then compared. RESULTS: A total of 288 patients were matched for each group and baseline characteristics were balanced between groups. The overall incidence of UTI was very low in both groups without significant difference. UTI requiring hospitalization occurred in only one patient in the AP group (0.1%) and none in the non-AP group. Nonhospitalized UTI occurred in 0.7% of the AP group and 0.3% of the non-AP group (P = 1.000). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in the rate of UTI based on the use or nonuse of AP prior to transperineal prostate biopsy. The overall incidence of UTI was very low regardless of the use of AP. Omission of AP prior to transperineal prostate biopsy might be possible, which would help promote antimicrobial stewardship.",

        "ArticleTitle": "New Spatial Phenotypes from Imaging Uncover Survival Differences for Breast Cancer Patients.",
        "AbstractText": "Imaging technologies have revolutionized the study of the tumor microenvironment (TME) by leveraging spatial analysis, which enables the exploration of tissue organization and cellular communication, as well as aiding cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, while many advanced spatial analysis methods have been recently published, they are enmeshed with specific imaging technology. An opportunity exists to develop a technology-agnostic methodology that captures complex spatial patterns in the TME as phenotypes to use in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a novel variation of spatial g-function and a comprehensive imaging-technology-agnostic framework that identifies rich spatial phenotypes that can be used in survival analysis and classification tasks. Applying our methodology to breast cancer, we uncover spatial phenotypes with significance to survival across racial groups and molecular subtypes of breast cancer. We find other phenotypes that are significant to the survival of specific patient categories (such as African American). We also demonstrate that our phenotypes reflect specific biological contexts. These results highlight the relevance of our proposed spatial analysis and phenotype discovery pipeline and demonstrate the benefits of the systematic exploration of spatial phenotypes for more personalized diagnosis and treatments.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: This study explored the impact of gynaecological cancer on women's expectations for motherhood, their concerns regarding their fertility, and how they negotiated these concerns in the survivorship context. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 42 Australian women with gynaecological cancer, aged between 27 to 53\u2009years, who were on average five years post-diagnosis (range 1-10\u2009years). Thematic discourse analysis, from a material-discursive-intrapsychic approach, was used to explore how women narrated their fertility-related concerns in the broader social and healthcare contexts. RESULTS: While narrating their experiences of having gynaecological cancer, the women in our study negotiated their accounts within two competing discourses - the pronatalist discourse and the survivorship discourse. Women's talk appeared conflicted by the social expectation to become a 'good' mother and focus on ensuring their fertility, while also managing the 'survivorship' imperative to focus exclusively on 'fighting' and beating cancer. Many women struggled to negotiate their fertility concerns and treatment decisions because of these two competing discourses. CONCLUSION: Dominant discourses around survival and prioritising motherhood create enormous conflict for women with gynaecological cancer coping with fertility concerns. Helping women to develop meaningful narratives is needed, particularly for women with ovarian cancer.",

Recently, helical tomotherapy was considered available for total body irradiation, although severe myelosuppression was frequently observed as an adverse event. We report the first case of low-dose helical tomotherapy in a patient with MF. An 87-year-old Asian male with an 18-year medical history of MF was referred to our department due to a rapidly growing skin lesion during systemic therapy. He decided to undergo low-dose total skin radiotherapy with helical tomotherapy. The total skin was treated by dividing into three parts (trunk, head, and lower extremities). Each part was treated with helical radiotherapy consisting of 10 Gy in 5 fractions, with the administration of 5 fractions per week. Once the skin lesion clearly disappeared after total skin radiotherapy, recurrence was detected in the lower abdominal wall in the radiation-treated field. Insufficient doses of radiation therapy cause early relapse. There is still no optimized dose for total skin irradiation in helical tomotherapy. Further radiation therapy dose trials are required to optimize the treatment schedule.",

        "AbstractText": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly malignant neoplasm of the digestive system. The primary objective of this investigation is to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying the role of the aging process and the related factor Epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) in PC progression. We established a prognostic model pertinent to the aging process that could be applied in postoperative PC patients. In vitro assays were employed to elucidate the impact of EMP1 on PC cell function. We employed lentiviral vectors for both knockdown and overexpression of EMP1 in Panc02 cells, followed by the establishment of subcutaneous, pulmonary metastasis, and orthotopic pancreatic liver metastasis models in mice. Using tissue microarrays, we evaluated the expression of EMP1 and its downstream entities, and then conducted clinical correlation analysis. A predictive Age-Related Score (ARS) system based on age-associated prognostic genes was developed, offering precise prognostic predictions for postoperative PC patients, which could be applied well at the single-cell level, showing diverse aging, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, cell proliferation, and PI3K/AKT signaling activity in high and low ARS risk cells. EMP1 was identified as a pivotal molecule in the ARS system and is associated with poor prognosis. Besides, EMP1 could enhance the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC cells both in vitro and in vivo by augmenting the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade. In essence, this research formulated an aging-centric prognostic model for postoperative PC and pinpointed EMP1 as an oncogenic factor facilitating tumor cell EMT during the aging trajectory in resectable PC patients.",

        "AbstractText": "This study explores the green synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) using Tamarix chinensis extract, known for its hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals. The ZnONPs were synthesized using ZnSO4 and NaOH, resulting in an average size of 125\u2009nm, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed a hexagonal crystalline structure. UV-Vis spectroscopy showed an absorption peak at 360\u2009nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 3.37\u2009eV, making these nanoparticles suitable for controlled drug delivery systems. The antioxidant activity of T. chinensis extract was evaluated using the DPPH assay, demonstrating an 80% inhibition of free radicals at 500\u2009\u00b5g/mL, surpassing the antioxidant potential of the ZnONPs. The antimicrobial efficacy of the ZnONPs was evidenced by a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <50\u2009\u00b5g/mL against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, the ZnONPs exhibited antiproliferative activity with an IC50 of 20.80\u2009\u00b5g/mL in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, highlighting their potential for biomedical applications. These findings suggest the promising multifunctional role of biosynthesized ZnONPs in healthcare and technological innovations.",

        "AbstractText": "AIM: Previous studies have examined bowel preparation as a measure to reduce surgical site infection (SSI) rates. This retrospective study aimed to identify the risk factors for SSI in right-sided colon cancer surgery using intracorporeal anastomosis (IA). We focused on perioperative factors, including the bowel preparation method, to clarify the impact of preoperative mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) and oral antibiotics (OA) on SSI incidence. METHODS: Patients (n\u2009=\u2009150) with right-sided colon cancer who underwent elective laparoscopic or robot-assisted colectomy (2019 and 2023) were included. Potential risk factors for SSI were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The overall incidence of SSI was 11 (7.3%) cases, with eight (5.4%) cases classified as incision site SSI and three (1.9%) as organ/space SSI. Univariate analysis showed that OA (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and MBP (p\u2009=\u20090.002) significantly reduced the SSI rate. Multivariate analysis identified OA as an independent risk factor (hazard ratio, 0.142; 95% confidence interval, 0.025-0.827; p\u2009=\u20090.025). Patients with SSI had longer postoperative hospital stays compared to those without SSI (median 9 vs. 8\u2009days, p\u2009=\u20090.012). On postoperative day 1, the group receiving OA had significantly lower white blood cell count (9390 vs. 10\u2009900/\u03bcL, p\u2009=\u20090.005) and C-reactive protein levels (3.81 vs. 7.83\u2009mg/dL, p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to those in the group not receiving OA.

        "AbstractText": "Brachydactyly A1 (BDA1) is a rare disorder characterized by the disproportionate shortening of fingers and/or toes with or without symphalangism. Mutations in Indian hedgehog signaling molecule (IHH), which impair the effect of functional IHH protein derived from its precursor IHH, are commonly identified in patients with BDA1 or acrocapitofemoral dysplasia (ACFD). The ultrasound phenotype of fetuses with IHH mutations has rarely been described. To better understand the consequences of IHH mutation, we analyzed the characteristics of a Chinese fetus with BDA1 caused by a novel heterozygous IHH mutation. Clinical data and genomic DNA were collected from the proband and family members. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify potential causative mutations. Sequence analysis was performed to investigate the conservation of the affected leucine residue in IHH. Protein 3D modeling was performed to predict the effects of the mutation on protein structure. In vitro overexpression transfection experiments in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cell lines were performed to evaluate the pathogenicity of the identified mutation. The fetal proband carried a novel heterozygous mutation in IHH (NM_002181.4: c.331_333delCTG, NP_002172.2: p.Leu111del) inherited from the father; this mutation manifested as shortening of the limbs, with more severe shortening observed in the proximal extremities than in the distal extremities, as evidenced by ultrasound. The Leu111 residue is highly conserved among vertebrates, and deletion of this residue destabilizes the protein structure. Western blotting analysis of HEK293T cells in overexpression transfection experiments revealed that the Leu111del mutation led to an increase in the level of the IHH precursor and a reduction in the level of functional IHH protein compared with those in HEK293T cells expressing wild-type IHH, indicating that this mutation might cause IHH protein dysmaturity. The novel heterozygous mutation c.331_333delCTG (p.Leu111del) in the IHH gene is the likely cause of BDA1 in this Chinese fetus. This mutation causes IHH protein maturation failure. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of BDA1 and the clinical identification of fetal BDA1.",

        "AbstractText": "In modern medicine, spleen, the largest secondary lymphoid organ, is responsible for red blood cell turnover and immune inductions. The immune system and spleen actively orchestrate local or systemic inflammatory responses under different disease conditions. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), spleen contributes to the body integrity and the essence of \"Qi\"by collaborating in concert with the other organs (\"Zang\" in TCM). In both realms, spleen is not a solitary organ since it constantly interacts or \"crosstalks\" with the rest of the body to maintain homeostasis by secreting or responding to signaling molecules from relevant pathways. Since the spleen is involved in organ crosstalk axes, the health status of many other organs can be potentially alluded when we clinically assess the spleen. However, due to structural delicacy and intrinsic disadvantages of conventional pathology such as biopsy, evaluating the spleen status is challenging. To this end, molecular imaging, a non-invasive and efficient modality, emerged as an elegant solution to provide highly precise depiction of spleen phenotypes. It provides a mesoscopic overview of the spleen's physical status and biological processes occurring at the cellular or molecular level in vivo. With the application of molecular imaging modalities, spleen is now appreciated as a key organ involved in the development or progress of various diseases, such as cancer. We expect molecular imaging of the spleen to be a robust starting point for us to understand the molecular level changes underlying physiological observations including spleen crosstalk in TCM and modern medicine, providing mechanistic evidence for phenotypic patterns.",

With the TME-Analyzer we have identified a 10-parameter classifier, predominantly featuring cellular distances, that significantly predicted overall survival, and which was validated using multiplexed ion beam time of flight images from an independent cohort. In conclusion, the TME-Analyzer enabled accurate interactive analysis of the spatial immune phenotype from different imaging platforms as well as enhanced utility and aided the discovery of contextual predictors towards the survival of TNBC patients.",

For the year 2024, it is estimated that 310,720 new instances of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed, and breast cancer will be responsible for over 42,000 deaths among women. Today, despite the availability of numerous treatments for breast cancer and its symptoms, most cancer-related deaths result from metastasis for which there is no treatment. This emphasizes the importance of early detection and treatment of breast cancer before it spreads. For initial detection and staging of breast cancer, clinicians routinely employ mammography and ultrasonography, which, while effective for broad screening, have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Advanced biomarkers could significantly enhance the precision of early detection, enable more accurate monitoring of disease evolution, and facilitate the development of personalized treatment plans tailored to the specific molecular profile of each tumor. This would not only improve therapeutic outcomes, but also help in avoiding overtreatment and the associated side effects, thereby improving the quality of life for patients. Thus, the pursuit of novel biomarkers, potentially encompassing metabolomic and lipidomic signatures, is essential for advancing breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

The role of TME on tumour pathophysiology is pivotal, especially the influence of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), such as collagen. We introduce a novel multimodal imaging strategy to unravel the complex spatial heterogeneity of CRC by integrating the imaging features from two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) and histology with proteomics signatures from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI). Our study is the first to correlate the structural coherence of collagen fibres and the nuclei distribution profile of tumour tissue with the peptide signatures, offering insights into the proteomic landscape of CRC within regions of high nuclei distribution (HND), as well as chaotic and organised regions of collagen. We use this approach to distinguish the patient tissues originating from left-sided colorectal cancer (LSCC) and from right-sided colorectal cancer (RSCC). This discriminative signature highlights the role of high nuclei distribution and collagen architecture in tumour progression. Complementary m/z values of several proteins associated to components of ECM, such as plectin, vinculin, vimentin, and myosin, have shown differentially intensity distributions between LSCC and RSCC.

All studies were reviewed with regard to methodological aspects as well as clinical applicability. It was found that the focus of current research is the assessment of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of adult-type diffuse gliomas. The majority of studies (52/83) are based on the publicly available glioblastoma and low-grade glioma datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and only a few studies employed other datasets in isolation (16/83) or in addition to the TCGA datasets (15/83).

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths worldwide, posing a significant public health challenge. Recent advances in molecular research and technologies have highlighted the potential of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as key players in CRC development and progression. High-throughput technologies, such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), enable comprehensive analysis of cancer omics data, providing valuable insights into CRC biology. This study aimed to identify and validate lncRNAs with potential roles in CRC pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, we conducted RNA-seq analysis using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs between 481 CRC and 41 healthy control samples. Using the Boruta feature selection algorithm, we identified statistically significant lncRNAs. Based on a comprehensive literature review, four lncRNAs (LINC01730, LINC02487, LINC01836, and LINC01594) were selected for experimental validation. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on 10 primary CRC and 9 normal colorectal tissue samples to quantify the expression of these lncRNAs. Additionally, bioinformatic analyses were conducted to explore molecular pathways associated with these lncRNAs in CRC. RESULTS: RNA-seq analysis identified 388 differentially expressed lncRNAs in CRC tissues compared to healthy controls. Among these, four lncRNAs (LINC01730, LINC02487, LINC01836, and LINC01594) were validated through real-time RT-PCR, confirming their significant upregulation in CRC tissues. Bioinformatic analysis revealed their potential involvement in molecular pathways critical to tumor growth and metastasis. CONCLUSION: This study identified and validated four significantly upregulated lncRNAs (LINC01730, LINC02487, LINC01836, and LINC01594) in CRC tissues, providing evidence of their potential roles in CRC pathogenesis. These lncRNAs could serve as promising candidates for future biomarker development and therapeutic research in colorectal cancer.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Histone lactylation as a driver of metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion.",
        "AbstractText": "Lactate is the end product of glycolysis, and extensive research has shown that lactate participates in various pathophysiological processes. Along with associated hydrogen ions, lactate typically functions as an immunosuppressive negative factor and plays a crucial role in tumor metabolic reprogramming. The recently discovered lactylation is a novel epigenetic modification that, similar to other epigenetic modifications, modifies histones to alter chromatin spatial configuration, thereby affecting DNA accessibility and regulating gene expression. More importantly, the degree of lactylation is closely related to local lactate concentrations, establishing a link between epigenetics and metabolic reprogramming. During cellular metabolism, lactate accumulation promotes histone lysine lactylation in cancer cells and immune cells such as macrophages and T\u00a0cells, playing an essential role in tumor immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. This paper details the role of lactylation modifications in cancer immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy, providing novel therapeutic directions and targets for cancer treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Recently, single-walled carbon nanotube-based optical biosensors have been shown to detect hydrolase activity directly on target substrates such as proteins and peptides. This study presents a metastable protein conjugation approach to immobilize more hydrophobic proteins and enhance the sensitivity of protease detection. The method combines covalent conjugation of substrate proteins via carbodiimide chemistry (EDC/NHS) with non-covalent polymer wrapping of SWCNT, in this case, carboxymethyl cellulose. The formation of protein-SWCNT complexes as a result of multi-site conjugation between the proteins and carboxyl groups, enabled iterative pelleting, washing, and resuspension steps to be applied to the probes which allowed for removal of unbound proteins and residual materials, enhancing the sensor's sensitivity by approximately threefold, reaching an LOD of 6.4 ng/ml in a 5 minute reaction. This immobilization approach is applied to the ECM proteins such as gelatin and collagen and used to detect ECM degrading enzymes' activity. ECM degrading enzymes caused a fluorescent intensity decrease of the SWCNT probes, enabling quantification of enzyme concentration between the range 160 ng/ml to 100 \u00b5g/ml within 5 minutes of reaction. This hybrid approach provides a rapid and sensitive platform for detecting extracellular degrading enzymes with potential applications in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, wound healing, high-throughput screening for enzyme inhibitors and drug discovery.",

        "AbstractText": "The demographic characteristics of breast cancer patients from disparate geographical regions vary considerably. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to present the clinicopathological features of breast cancer patients at our center and to conduct a comparative analysis with the findings of other studies. This retrospective descriptive study, which included 816 patients registered in the two years between October 2021 and September 2023, was conducted in the Department of Medical Oncology at a government tertiary cancer care center in southern India. At the initial presentation, the median age was 49 years, with the majority of patients being postmenopausal. The most common presenting complaint was a breast lump, which was reported in 636 cases (77.9%). Additionally, 115 cases (14.09%) involved axillary edema. A family history of breast cancer was evident in 19.9% (162/816) of the patients. Of the patients, 594 (72.8%) exhibited hormone receptor positivity. Of the total number of cases, 202 (nearly 25%) were positive for HER2/neu by FISH or IHC. A total of 178 patients (21.9%) were diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The majority of patients (46.8%) presented at a late stage, classified as Stage III. In cases of stage IV disease, there was a greater prevalence of skeletal metastases (40.3%) compared to visceral metastases. The present study offers insight into the current state of breast cancer patients in Southern India. The majority of patients were postmenopausal. Additionally, there has been an observed increase in the number of patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors, accompanied by a higher prevalence of metastatic disease involving skeletal metastasis compared to other sites. It is imperative to enhance awareness about breast cancer, assuage apprehensions, and disseminate information about the significance of screening, prompt diagnosis, and treatment. Such studies provide a foundation for understanding the extent of the problem and facilitate the identification of potential solutions.",

However, the precise role of TATE in these contexts remains to be fully elucidated. The present study was undertaken to investigate the presence of tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) and its correlation with histopathologic grading. A total of 70 OSCC tissue samples were collected between 2016 and 2020 for examination. The samples comprised 60 previously diagnosed cases of OSCC, classified as well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (WDSCC), moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (MDSCC), and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (PDSCC). Two observers independently assessed TATE using Sirius red stain, with the average eosinophil count evaluated in 10 fields under the \u00d740 objective lens. Statistical analysis involved the Student t-test, One-way ANOVA, and chi-square test. The study encompassed 70 OSCC samples and corresponding healthy tissue, with OSCC predominantly found in the tongue, representing 61.4% of cases. The total eosinophil count per high-power field (HPF10) was significantly higher in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) compared to healthy tissue. Furthermore, the mean TATE score was found to be considerably elevated in OSCC tissue. However, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a statistically non-significant association between different grades of OSCC and eosinophil counts. However, the chi-square test did not indicate a significant association between eosinophil count and gender or age group. The present study underscores the heightened eosinophil count observed in cancerous tissues compared to healthy tissues. However, the variability in eosinophil counts across distinct OSCC grades remains ambiguous. Further investigation is recommended to delve into the infiltration of eosinophils in solid tumors and their potential role in predicting malignancies, particularly in OSCC.",

        "AbstractText": "The risk of cancer development posed by papillomavirus (PV) infections is significant, affecting both humans and domestic animals. This underscores the importance of understanding and addressing this viral threat. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs), in enhancing the immune response against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and tumor-related neoantigens, thereby facilitating their neutralization by the immune system. Furthermore, vaccines designed to enhance the immune response against PV-infected cells have yielded promising results, strengthening CD4+ and CD8+ T cell reactions and potentially impeding cancer progression. The oncoproteins E6 and E7, which are notably implicated in the development of malignancies, exert deleterious effects by disrupting tumor suppressor proteins and facilitating immune evasion and tumor proliferation, particularly in high-risk PV genotypes such as HPV-16 and HPV-18. Notwithstanding obstacles such as vaccine hesitancy and concerns regarding vaccine toxicity, PV vaccines have transformed disease prevention strategies, offering a promising avenue in the fight against PV-associated cancers. Advancements in precision medicine and immunotherapy offer promise in the management of advanced PV-related cancers. By identifying and exploiting specific molecular vulnerabilities, while simultaneously bolstering immune responses, these approaches may prove invaluable in combating this disease. This transformative approach has the potential to treat established cancers and prevent their recurrence and progression. Consequently, immunotherapies, therapeutic vaccines, and precision medicine have become the subject of considerable scientific interest due to their capacity to enhance the quality of life and outcomes for individuals afflicted with PV-related cancers. By harnessing the immune system's power and leveraging cutting-edge therapeutic modalities, researchers and clinicians are poised to reshape the landscape of cancer treatment, offering renewed hope and optimism for those affected by PV-associated malignancies. It is therefore imperative that innovative strategies be integrated into clinical practice in order to effectively combat the formidable challenge posed by PV-induced cancers. In conclusion, this review presents a promising direction for combating PV infections and associated malignancies, with the potential to transform the landscape of cancer treatment. By employing immunotherapies, therapeutic vaccines, and precision medicine, researchers and clinicians are positioned to make substantial advancements in the prevention and treatment of PV-related cancers, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.",

        "AbstractText": "One of the most destructive diseases of the twenty-first century is cancer, which has given rise to significant concerns among medical professionals and academics alike. In order to achieve victory in the fight against cancer, a multitude of therapeutic modalities are currently being investigated. Nanotechnology has emerged as a significant field of scientific inquiry, with potential applications across a range of disciplines. It draws upon insights from a range of disciplines, including chemistry, physics, materials science, engineering, biology, and health sciences. In recent years, there has been a notable surge in the application of nanotechnology in the field of medicine, with the aim of preventing and treating diseases within the human body. Over the past two decades, manganese oxide nanomaterials (MnONs) and their derivatives have garnered increasing interest for applications in bioimaging, biosensing, drug/gene delivery, and tumor therapy. This is due to the tunable structures/morphologies, unique physical/chemical properties, and excellent biosecurity of these materials. The green synthesis of MnNPs using raw materials, vegetables and fruits, plant extracts, microorganisms, and fungi offers several advantages, including non-toxicity, environmental friendliness, cleanliness, and cost-effectiveness. Given the variety of mechanisms through which they act, green-produced MnNPs represent a promising source of new anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds. MnNPs have been demonstrated to exert anti-proliferative activity against a range of cancer cells, including those of the colon, liver, cervix, breast, melanoma, and prostate, by activating apoptotic signal transduction pathways or inhibiting angiogenic signaling. In the context of cancer treatment, research is being conducted into the potential of metal nanotherapy, including the use of MnO NPs. The enhanced tissue penetration and retention properties of MnO facilitate its function as a drug carrier. MnONPs have been proposed to exhibit enzyme-like activities, including peroxidase, catalase, oxidase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. The biocompatibility obtained through green synthesis indicates the potential for its use not only in specific cancer conditions but also in other types of cancer, without the risk of toxicity associated with these compounds. It is conceivable that these therapeutic strategies may prove beneficial not only in the aforementioned cases of cancer but also in other instances of proliferative disorders. The low risk of toxicity associated with these compounds, as evidenced by the biocompatibility obtained through green synthesis, suggests their potential use in a range of biomedical applications.",

        "AbstractText": "The emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represents a significant public health concern among long-term hospitalized patients, particularly those with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients. This is primarily due to MRSA's ability to resist antimicrobial agents and drugs. The objective of this study is to ascertain the antibiotic resistance pattern of MRSA in cancer patients admitted to hospitals in the southwest region of Iran. The samples obtained from the patients were cultivated on blood agar and EMB medium. Subsequently, the positive samples containing S. aureus were identified through the application of a phenotypic method. Subsequently, the cefoxitin antibiogram was employed for the isolation of MRSA. Furthermore, the isolates were subjected to testing for simultaneous drug resistance against 12 different antibiotics. To detect the presence of the mec gene, a molecular method was employed, namely the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, and electrophoresis of the obtained products was conducted. Of the 41 S. aureus samples identified, 33 were found to be methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Of the 33 MRSA isolates, the presence of the mec gene was confirmed, and they exhibited simultaneous drug resistance. Individuals with cancer, who frequently have indwelling catheters and receive a variety of drugs and blood products, are at an elevated risk of contamination with this bacterium due to its presence on their skin and the hands of healthcare providers. The indiscriminate use of drugs and the subsequent rise in drug resistance can contribute to prolonged hospitalization and even death among these individuals. Given that Ahvaz hospitals, particularly Bagai Hospital, serve as primary treatment centers for patients with incurable and cancerous conditions in southwestern Iran, it is of significant value and importance to investigate the resistance patterns observed in patients undergoing chemotherapy and post-transplantation.",

In recent years, there has been a notable increase in interest among researchers in exploring alternative therapeutic methods, including stem cell therapy. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned media (AD-MSCs-CM) on apoptosis induction and migration inhibition of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) in vitro. In this study, malignant breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) were cultured separately in DMEM/F12/FBS (15%) culture media under standard conditions. Subsequently, the conditioned media derived from AD-MSCs was introduced to the MDA-MB-231 cells. Following a 24- and 48-hour exposure period, the expression levels of CASP3, KRAS, and MMP9 were evaluated using a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Furthermore, the proliferation and migration abilities of the cancer cells were evaluated using MTT and wound healing assays, respectively. Furthermore, the protein expression of Caspase-3, K-RAS, and MMP-9 was examined using a western blot assay. It is noteworthy that the expression levels of the MMP9 and KRAS genes were significantly reduced following treatment with AD-MSCs-CM in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, the CASP3 gene expression level was found to have increased significantly in the treated groups. Additionally, the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with AD-MSCs-CM was markedly diminished by MTT and wound healing assays. Moreover, the AD-MSCs-CM was observed to induce caspase-3 activation and reduce the protein expression of K-RAS and MMP-9. The results of this study indicate that AD-MSCs-CM may exert an influence on the apoptosis, proliferation, and migration of breast cancer cells. Consequently, it could be proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy for the suppression of breast cancer. However, further testing and research are required to validate these findings and to ascertain the full potential of this approach.",

Mutations in the UPF1 locus that reduce its expression have been associated with adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas, a particularly aggressive form of the disease. To determine the effect of Upf1 suppression in a murine model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, we silenced with shRNA Upf1 in cells derived from an autochthonous tumor in an LSL-KrasG12D/+; Trp53R172H/+; Pdx-1Cre/+ mouse (KPC) and orthotopically implanted these cells in the pancreas of C57BL/6 mice. Tumors derived from Upf1-deficient cells were markedly larger than those derived from control cells, a difference observed only in immunocompetent mice. The immune infiltrate of Upf1-deficient tumors was enriched in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and depleted of CD8+ cells compared to control KPC tumors. Upf1-deficient KPC cells secreted inflammatory cytokines including G-CSF and CXCL2, known to recruit MDSCs. Cytokine secretion from Upf1-deficient KPC cells was induced by increased levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn were due to an increase in complex I activity in the electron transport chain. Thus, Upf1 helicase deficiency leads to increased mitochondrial complex I activity which produces ROS that signals for cytokine release that drives immune suppression and enhanced tumor growth.",

Therefore, we intended to conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis in order to examine the relationship between schizophrenia and the risk of breast cancer incidence. Method : We did a systematic search of databases, namely Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and PsycINFO up to August 15, 2024. Screening and data extraction were performed independently. Data was analyzed using Stata16 software. We used the random effect model to pool the results, while the heterogeneity between studies was calculated using Cochran's Q test and (I2) index. Results: We found 15 studies, among which 12 were included in this meta-analysis. The results indicated that the risk of breast cancer development is significantly increased in women with schizophrenia (SIR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.08-1.85, P < 0.01; IRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.13-1.26, P < 0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed significant differences in the incidence of breast cancer rates among women with schizophrenia based on geographic location and duration of follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to analyse the clinico-pathological spectrum of these rare chordoma cases visiting our tertiary care institute. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was retrospective, comprising chordoma cases reported histopathologically between January 01, 2013, and August 31, 2023 (a total period of 10.5 years). Clinico-radiological data were recorded. Histopathological diagnosis was separately reviewed by two pathologists. All data were statistically analysed. RESULTS: In total, 41 chordoma cases were received, with a mean age of 43.2\u2009+\u200917.4 years (6-72 years). Male:female ratio was 1.2:1. Spheno-occipital region chordomas (27 cases) were most common, followed by sacrococcygeal (8 cases) and vertebral (6 cases) chordomas. Symptoms varied with location. However, the commonest presenting complaint was pain. These region-wise chordoma categories were statistically compared in terms of patients' age, male:female ratio, symptomatic duration, tumour size, histopathological tumour type, and recurrence on follow-up.

A fundamental question is how cells coordinate switching of gene expression clusters. By analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data within the framework of transition path theory, we studied the genome-wide expression program switching in five different cell transition processes. For each process we reconstructed a reaction coordinate describing the transition progression, and inferred the gene regulatory network along this reaction coordinate. In all processes we observed a common pattern: the overall effective number and strength of regulation between different communities increase first and then decrease. This change is accompanied by similar changes in gene regulatory network frustration-defined as the overall conflict between the regulation received by genes and their expression states. Complementing previous studies suggesting that biological networks are modularized to contain perturbation effects locally, our analyses on the five cell transition processes likely reveal a general principle: during a cell phenotypic transition, intercommunity interactions increase to concertedly coordinate global gene expression reprogramming and canalize to specific cell phenotype, as Waddington visioned.",

About 90% of instances of pancreatic cancer are pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and occasionally \"pancreatic cancer\" is used exclusively to describe this subtype. Nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and FOLFIRINOX are examples of modern chemotherapeutic drugs that have the ability to quickly confer resistance in pancreatic tumor cells. Therefore, in order to treat this dreadful condition, it is essential to develop more effective medicines. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) causes pancreatic cancer cells to die apoptotically. In eukaryotes, UPS is an essential mechanism for protein breakdown. Pancreatic cancer cells are more susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum stress (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress) and apoptosis when treated with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that is the first in this group of drugs approved for the treatment of cancer, especially multiple myeloma. METHODS: Searching through PubMed and Google Scholar and gathering data. RESULTS: UPS is still a popular target for pancreatic cancer treatment among researchers. However, despite the favorable results of UPS-based therapies in vitro and in vivo, the clinical results are not as promising as expected. CONCLUSION: A deep understanding of it, is essential to achieving the maximum results. In this review, we aim to look into the UPS along with searching for the novelist therapies for pancreatic adenocarcinoma based on manipulating it.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Ovarian cancer (OV) stands as the deadliest female reproductive system malignancy. Globally, OV ranks as the seventh most prevalent cancer in women, with an estimated 240,000 new cases annually and being the second most common malignancy among women in Egypt. OBJECTIVES: We investigate the efficacy of cytoreductive surgery in achieving complete tumor removal (R0 resection) in OV, compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. METHOD: This randomized controlled trial at Women Health Hospital, Asyut University, Egypt from 2020 to 2023. Eighty patients were randomized (1:1) to primary surgery (Group I) or NACT (Group II), followed by further randomization (1:1) within each group to bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. The primary outcome was the rate of complete tumor removal (R0 resection). Secondary outcomes included surgical complexity, operative time, complications, and survival rates. RESULTS: Baseline demographic characteristics were similar between the groups (no statistically significant differences). The mean age for group I and group II were (56.3 and 57.23, respectively). Whereas, the BMI for group I and group II were (32.56 and 33.2, respectively). In addition, both groups achieved no significant difference of complete tumor removal (31 vs. 27). However, group II demonstrated significantly shorter operative times (182.34 vs. 219.85\u00a0min, p\u2009=\u20090.047), required fewer blood transfusions (9 vs. 21, p value 0.006), and experienced shorter hospital stays (6.13 vs. 11.9 days, p value\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to group I. Notably, no significant differences emerged in complication rates, progression-free survival (11.20 vs. 11.19\u00a0months), or overall survival (11.69 vs. 11.76\u00a0months) between the groups. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that optimal cytoreduction is more feasible with NACT, with less surgical complexity, shorter operative duration, less blood transfusion and short hospital stay.Clinical Trials registration The study was registered on clincaltrail.gov with number: NCT04257786.

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred neuroradiologic tool for evaluating the sellar region. Pituitary adenomas account for about 15% of primary intracranial tumors. The optimal time for postoperative MRI of central nervous system neoplasms is 48 hours after surgery. Nevertheless, controversy exists regarding the timing of postoperative MRI in the sellar region. This study analyzed the sellar MRI findings of patients with pituitary adenoma at different times before and after surgery. Finally, we suggest the optimal time for postoperative sellar MRI imaging in patients with pituitary adenoma. METHODS: A total of 28 patients with pituitary adenoma were evaluated. All patients did four sellar MRIs. The first MRI was done before surgery, and three were done 48 hours, two weeks, and three months after the surgery. Finally, the MRI findings at different times were compared to each other. RESULTS: The pituitary gland and adenoma signals were constant at all time points. The signal of the packing material showed no differences in T1-weighted and T1-weighted with contrast sequences but showed changes in T2-weighted sequences. CONCLUSION: Contrary to other intracranial neoplasms, there were no apparent changes in MRI signal intensity during the 3 months after surgery in patients with pituitary adenoma. There was also no superiority of one time point for performing follow-up imaging.",

        "AbstractText": "L-Arginase is a therapeutic enzyme that hydrolyzes L-arginine to ornithine and urea. The L-arginase extracted from bacteria has an anticancer activity by causing starvation of nutrients for cancer cells. This study aimed to screen and characterize L-arginase-producing bacteria and to optimize different factors influencing L-arginase production. Isolation and primary screening were carried out by using mineral arginine agar media using phenol red as an indicator. Molecular identification of the isolates was employed by using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and phylogenetic tree construction. L-Arginase assay by colorimetric method was carried out to measure the amount of urea liberated from the hydrolysis of L-arginine for quantitative screening. From 31 water samples, 102 colonies were isolated, and those colonies that convert the media to pink were selected as arginase-producing bacteria. 7 isolates were screened from qualitative screening method. Based on quantitative screening, the highest L-arginase was produced from bacteria Alcaligenes aquatilis BC2 (92.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 U/ml) followed by Paenalcaligenes suwonensis BCW8 (59.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.66 U/ml). Following their mean difference, isolate BC2 was selected for further optimization process of 8 parameters. After optimization, the isolate shows the maximum (163.85 U/ml) enzyme activity. The result of this study implies that novel bacteria were isolated from soda lakes that produce a considerable amount of L-arginase, which can be used as a promising anticancer activity. One-Sentence Summary: This study successfully isolated and characterized a novel L-arginase-producing bacterium, Alcaligenes aquatilis BC2, from Ethiopian soda lakes and optimized its enzyme production parameters for potential anticancer applications.",

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: This study explores challenges faced by a large, diverse sample of cancer survivors who received care in the rural state of Arkansas to provide holistic insight into the quality of survivorship. METHODS: We used a theory-driven exploratory descriptive design to explore cancer survivors' (n = 519) biggest cancer-related challenges. RESULTS: Cancer survivors' challenges were organized using a priori domains from the Quality of Survival framework: quality of life, survival, managing the side effects, and managing the economic impact. Nearly half (48.4%) of all responses identified challenges related to quality of life, and 39.7% of all responses focused on the challenges of managing the side effects of cancer and its treatment. Managing the economic impact (6.9%) and survival (4.9%) were also identified as challenges by survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors faced a range of challenges from cancer and its treatment. Survivors primarily faced psychosocial challenges, issues with ongoing care, and physical and/or functional sequelae. Managing the economic impact and financial toxicity of cancer treatment and surviving cancer and its treatment were less frequently identified among the challenges faced by survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Our analysis highlights the importance of understanding the psychosocial and physical sequelae of cancer and its treatment. Our research helps fill significant gaps in the literature, improving the understanding of rural cancer survivorship. Nuanced understanding of survivors' experiences, using theory-driven qualitative and mixed-methods approaches, will continue to be critical for developing effective, evidence-based practices to meet the needs of survivors.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer has become the most prevalent disease and its incidence has almost doubled in the Indian population. This increased burden demands new targeted therapies with novel compounds either synthetically produced or derived from indigenous plants, which could be a promising approach for the development of drugs. Euphorbia thymifolia L is a widely growing tropical herb that has been reported to have various ethnopharmacological properties. Although Euphorbia genus is reported to have anticancer properties, E. thymifolia is not reported to have anticancer properties to date. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to screen the phytoconstituents and identify the active compounds present in the methanolic extract of E. thymifolia (ME.ET) as ligands to inhibit human cancer cell lines with special reference to potential protein targets implicated in breast cancer using an In-silico approach. METHODS: ME.ET was subjected to GC-MS analysis to screen the phytoconstituents, and the identified compounds were docked with protein targets such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1), a serine/threonine kinase-1(AKT1), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), polo-like kinase-1(PLK1), and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK6). Compounds with good docking scores were further subjected to dynamic studies to understand the protein ligand binding stability, ligand pathway calculation, and molecular mechanics energies combined with Poisson-Boltzmann (MM/PBSA) calculations using the Schrodinger suite. RESULTS: GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 245 phytoconstituents, 219 of which were unique. When subjected to docking, these phytocompounds, namely 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1,14-diyl dibenzoate (TTDB) and succinic acid, 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl 4-isopropylphenyl ester (SADPE), showed good docking scores. Molecular dynamics studies showed a high affinity and low binding energy for TTDB with HER2, ERK1, and SADPE with ER. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, in this study, we identified two lead compounds in E.thymifolia linn. Further invitro and invivo anticancer studies can be performed to confirm these results and to understand the molecular mechanism by which they exhibit anticancer activity against breast cancer.",

METHODS: This systematic review followed the PRISMA 2020 guideline and the protocol (CRD42022282611). Five databases were searched from inception to November 7, 2022 for randomised controlled trials on prehabilitation targeting \u22652 predefined risky lifestyles compared with usual preoperative routines. Risky lifestyles included Smoking, Nutrition (malnutrition and/or BMI>25), risky Alcohol intake, and Physical inactivity (SNAP). Primary outcome was postoperative complications \u226430 days. Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool 2 was used and meta-analyses were conducted. GRADE was used to assess certainty of evidence. RESULTS: The search resulted in 20,862 records. At full-text screening, only two (120 participants) of 24 identified trials on combined SNAP intervention had \u22652 predefined risk factors and were included. One (n=110) on intensive physical and brief nutritional intervention to frail patients with colorectal cancer resection reported complication rates of 45% in both groups (relative risk (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.51). The other study (n=10, subgroup) on intensive alcohol and smoking intervention in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy, reported complications in 3/7 vs 3/3 participants.

The present study examined the influence of cultural tightness-looseness on access to palliative care (i.e., statewide percentage of hospitals with palliative care programs) across the 50 U.S. states while controlling for demographic covariates. Results of regression analyses demonstrated that states with looser cultures (i.e., less adherence to norms) had better palliative care access (\u03b2 = .501, p = .012).

METHODS: A single case report documented with multimodal imaging. RESULTS: A 41-year-old asymptomatic female was referred for a second opinion regarding whitish retinal lesions in her left eye, first identified by her local optometrist 8 years prior. Her history included Hashimoto thyroiditis, with no personal or family history of tuberous sclerosis complex or neurofibromatosis. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Fundoscopy of the left eye revealed two pearly white avascular retinal masses. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed hyperreflective intraretinal masses with optical shadowing. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) demonstrated a signal void in the retinal vascular plexuses. Fundus autofluorescence showed moderate hyperautofluorescence. The lesions remained stable over 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: PSCRAP is a rare, benign retinal tumor. Multimodal imaging, including SD-OCT and OCTA, is essential for accurate diagnosis, showing unique features such as separation from the retinal nerve fiber layer and lack of intrinsic vascularity. Our observation of two lesions raises questions about the solitary nature of this condition.

HMA/VEN is increasingly substituted for IC in adults with AML aged <75 years, particularly in those with adverse cytogenetic and molecular features. When patients fail to respond or relapse after HMA/VEN, the utility of salvage IC is largely unknown. We performed a retrospective single-institution study and identified 46 patients who received IC after HMA/VEN, including 24 patients who received HMA/VEN as their first treatment for AML. This population had complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi)/morphologic leukemia-free state rate of 37%, CR/CRi rate of 28%, and a median overall survival (mOS) of 7.2\u00a0months (95% confidence interval, 5.0-10.3).

        "AbstractText": "Chemoresistance represents an ongoing challenge in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and a better understanding of the resistance mechanisms can lead to the development of novel AML therapies. Here, we demonstrated that low expression of the DNA damage response gene Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) correlates with poor overall survival and worse prognosis in patients with AML. Moreover, we showed that SLFN11 plays an essential role in regulating chemotherapy sensitivity in AML. AML cells with suppressed levels of SLFN11 do not undergo apoptosis in response to cytarabine because of aberrant activation of the Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)/Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) pathway, allowing for DNA damage repair, whereas sensitivity to cytarabine can be restored by inhibiting the ATR pathway. Importantly, SLFN11 knockout AML cells retain sensitivity to hypomethylating agents and the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax. Altogether, these results reveal SLFN11 as an important regulator and predictor of chemotherapy sensitivity in AML and suggest that targeting pathways suppressed by SLFN11 may offer potential combination therapies to enhance and optimize chemotherapy responses in AML.",

We measured COVID-19 antibodies after doses of COVID-19 vaccine in patients with HCL (n\u00a0= 415) and HCLv (n\u00a0= 32). After the second COVID-19 vaccine dose, spike antibody level most strongly correlated with normal B-cell levels (r\u00a0= 0.365, P\u00a0< .0001), followed by CD4+ T-cell count (r\u00a0= 0.244, P\u00a0= .0002), and was less related to immunoglobulin G level (r\u00a0= 0.101, P\u00a0= .14). Spike antibody also correlated with normal B cells after the third to fifth vaccine doses and with CD4+ count after the third dose. Normal B-cells were undetectable in 87% of patients within 6\u00a0months after the last dose of anti-CD20 mAb and were lower than in patients at 6 to 12\u00a0months (P\u00a0= .0003), which, in turn, were lower than at 12 to 18\u00a0months (P\u00a0= .0002). Infection with COVID-19 became more common after use of the third vaccine dose; spike antibody levels were higher in patients with prior infection (positive vs negative nucleocapsid antibodies; P\u00a0< .0001). Spike antibodies decreased faster after ibrutinib or anti-CD20 mAb. We conclude that decreased levels of normal B cells in patients with HCL/HCLv, due to disease and/or anti-CD20 therapy, are associated with lower COVID-19 vaccination efficiency and such patients may not respond well to vaccines.

The polycomb group protein chromobox 7 (CBX7) is an epigenetic regulator that represses genes required for differentiation and cell cycle arrest and thereby promotes self-renewal. Because leukemic cells are highly self-renewing, we tested whether pharmacological targeting of CBX7 would reduce self-renewal and induce differentiation of human leukemic cells. We found that existing and newly developed CBX7 inhibitors derepress the epigenome, resulting in reduced ubiquitination of histone 2A and reduced binding of CBX7 to its target genes. This led to reduced cell growth, increased differentiation of leukemic cells in\u00a0vitro, and delayed engraftment of primary leukemic cells in xenotransplant models. Therefore, pharmacological targeting of CBX7 constitutes a novel therapeutic approach for leukemia.",

        "AbstractText": "Venetoclax, a selective B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for multiple myeloma (MM), particularly in patients harboring the t(11;14) translocation. In this study, we set out to identify markers of sensitivity and resistance to venetoclax in a real-world patient population, aiming to facilitate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. Through the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from relapsed/refractory patients treated with venetoclax, either as a single agent or in combination with other drugs, we unveiled a novel 6-gene signature that significantly stratified patients into risk groups for relapse and further validated its clinical relevance in 2 independent clinical and ex\u00a0vivo data sets. Our analysis also highlighted the negative impact of chromosome 1q gain, which harbors the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) gene, on progression-free survival, even in t(11;14)-positive patients. Encouraged by the well-documented role of MCL1 in resistance to venetoclax in various malignancies and the prognostic importance of the BCL2/MCL1 ratio in our cohort, we explored Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 7 (CDK7) inhibition as a potential strategy to overcome venetoclax resistance. In\u00a0vitro experiments demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated CDK7 depletion led to decreased MCL1 levels, enhancing the sensitivity of MM cells to venetoclax. Moreover, the combination of the CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 with venetoclax markedly induced cell death in venetoclax-resistant MM cells harboring 1q gain, thus offering a rational therapeutic approach, particularly for patients with this aberration. Overall, these findings provide important insights for optimizing venetoclax-based therapeutic strategies in MM.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Deciphering MARCH5's impact on multiple myeloma: insights into autophagy regulation and AKT-FOXO3 signaling.",
        "AbstractText": "Multiple myeloma (MM) stands as a formidable blood malignancy, necessitating innovative therapeutic approaches. Excessive immunoglobulin production within myeloma cells leads to a buildup of toxic proteins, and autophagy plays a crucial role in their survival by degrading toxic aggregates and generating energy. Membrane-associated RING finger protein 5 (MARCH5) is an E3-ligase positioned at the outer mitochondrial membrane and has been shown to regulate autophagy by competing for MicroRNA 30a (MIR30A). Given the fundamental significance of autophagy in promoting the survival of myeloma cells, coupled with the regulatory role of MARCH5 in autophagic activity, we hypothesized that MARCH5 plays an essential function in MM and holds a pivotal position in the pathogenesis and progression of MM. We identified MARCH5's unique dependencies in MM cells by analyzing the Cancer Dependency Map, thereby establishing its significance in MM biology. Examining various data sets, including CoMMpass (Clinical Outcomes in Multiple Myeloma to Personal Assessment of Genetic Profile Study) and HOVON (Haemato-Oncology Foundation for Adults in the Netherlands), demonstrated a correlation between MARCH5 expression and patient outcomes. Knockdown of MARCH5 revealed a substantial reduction in MM cell viability, which was associated with a decrease in autophagic activity. Mechanistically, we unraveled a novel MARCH5/AKT/FOXO3 axis, wherein MARCH5 regulates autophagy through the Protein Kinase B (AKT)-mediated degradation of Forkhead Box O3 (FOXO3). Compromised MM cell viability observed with MARCH5 knockdown was recapitulated in FOXO3 knockdown experiments, validating the pivotal role of FOXO3 in mediating MARCH5's effects. In conclusion, this research highlights the crucial role of MARCH5 in MM, and the identified MARCH5/AKT/FOXO3 axis enhances our understanding of MM biology and provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies.",

Although the prognosis of pediatric T-ALL has improved with intensified chemotherapy regimens, this benefit has largely not translated to the adult T-ALL population. Development of new treatments requires understanding the mechanisms driven by specific mutations. DNMT3A mutations are identified in \u223c10% to 18% of adult patients with T-ALL and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Here, using primary human specimens, we show that cells from patients with T-ALL with DNMT3A mutations are resistant to apoptosis and certain chemotherapies. Elevated JAK/STAT signaling drove prosurvival programs in patients with mutant DNMT3A, and JAK/STAT inhibition restored sensitivity to chemotherapy. The prosurvival gene BIRC5 was upregulated in patients with DNMT3A-mutant T-ALL, and these cells were specifically sensitive to the Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 5 (BIRC5) inhibitor YM155. Genetic inhibition of BIRC5 in\u00a0vivo lead to rapid depletion of DNMT3A-mutant T-ALL cells in patient-derived xenografts, positioning BIRC5 as a precision medicine target for these patients.",

It has been targeted clinically with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), for which efficacy may be limited by natural killer (NK)-cell fratricide. Isatuximab is an anti-CD38 mAb that uniquely inhibits CD38 metabolic activity. Here, we used CRISPR/adeno-associated virus (AAV) to generate fratricide-resistant and metabolically-enhanced CD38KO/CD38-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells using 2 isatuximab-based CD38 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs; reversing heavy and light chain orientation) on the same CD8\u03b1/4-1BB/CD3\u03b6 base, and we demonstrate their activity against a range of CD38+ hematologic malignancies (acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, Burkitt lymphoma, and T-cell leukemia/lymphoma). The cytotoxicity of the CAR NK cells was enhanced by upregulating CD38 expression on the malignant targets with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). By generating CD38KO/CD38-CAR T cells using the same engineering approach, we show that the CAR NK cells had higher cytotoxicity than CAR T cells against all hematologic tumor targets. Additionally, AAVS1KO/CD38-CAR NK cells were capable of targeting CD38 without experiencing fratricide and have a similar enhanced metabolic activity via the inhibitory activity of the cis-acting isatuximab-based scFv. Finally, we report fratricide-resistant CD38-CAR NK cells with enhanced metabolism and cytotoxicity toward CD38+ hematologic malignancies, further increased by combination treatment with ATRA.",

This study aimed to identify effective fear appeal public service announcements (PSAs) capable of promoting intentions for H. pylori prevention. METHOD: The participants in our experiments were recruited from an online survey platform in China. Experiment 1 employed a 2 (self-oriented threat: present vs. absent) \u00d7 2 (other-oriented threat: present vs. absent) \u00d7 2 (personal efficacy: present vs. absent) design to assess H. pylori screening intentions. A total of 312 participants were randomly assigned to eight conditions. Experiment 2 utilized a 2 (self-oriented threat: present vs. absent) \u00d7 2 (other-oriented threat: present vs. absent) \u00d7 2 (efficacy types: personal vs. collective) design to evaluate intentions to use separate serving chopsticks as the risk-reducing dining custom, with 293 participants randomly assigned to eight conditions. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, positive effects were observed for self-oriented threat, other-oriented threat, and personal efficacy in fear appeal PSAs on H. pylori screening intention. The three-way interaction effect revealed that the effects of fear appeal PSAs on H. pylori screening intentions depended on the presence of other-oriented threat. In Experiment 2, fear appeal PSAs with a collective efficacy message elicited higher intentions to use separate serving chopsticks than PSAs with a self-efficacy message. CONCLUSIONS: Fear appeal PSAs aimed at promoting H. pylori prevention could highlight other-oriented threat and collective efficacy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Nodal metastases (lymph node metastasis [LNM]) are one of the major determinants of prognosis following surgery for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Previous studies investigating the correlation between clinical-radiological features and the probability of LNM include patients undergoing inadequate nodal sampling. Aim of this study was to develop a model to predict the risk of LNM in patients undergoing adequate lymphadenectomy using preoperative clinical and radiological features. METHODS: Patients undergoing radical surgery for ICC with adequate lymphadenectomy at seven Italian Centers between 2000 and 2023 were collected and divided into a derivation and a validation cohort. Logistic regression and dominance analysis were applied in the derivation cohort to identify variables associated with LNM at pathology. The final coefficients were derived from the model having the highest c-statistic in the derivation cohort with the lowest number of variables included (parsimony). The model was then tested in the external validation cohort, and the linear predictor was divided into quartiles to generate four risk categories. RESULTS: A total of 693 patients were identified. Preoperative CA 19-9, clinically suspicious lymph nodes at radiology, patients' age, and tumor burden score were significantly associated with LNM. These factors were included in a model (https://aicep.website/calculators/) showing a c-statistic of 0.723 (95% CI: 0.680, 0.766) and 0.771 (95% CI: 0.699, 0.842) in the derivation and validation cohort, respectively. A progressive increase of pathological lymph node positivity across risk groups was observed (29.9% in low-risk, 45.1% in intermediate-low risk, 51.5% in intermediate-high risk, and 87.3% in high-risk patients; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A novel model that combines preoperative CA 19-9, clinically suspicious lymph nodes at radiology, patients' age, and tumor burden score was developed to predict the risk of LNM before surgery. The model exhibited high accuracy and has the potential to assist clinicians in the management of patients who are candidate to surgery.",

METHODS: This multicenter prospective study included 54 patients with inoperable HCC of \u22645 cm size between July 2012 and June 2015. A total SBRT dose of 60 Gy in 3 fractions was administered within 14 days with \u226548-h interfraction interval to patients who showed an incomplete response after 1-5 sessions of TACE. Treatment responses were defined according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors. Toxicities were evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were evaluated with a median follow-up period of 66 months (range, 2-126 months). The median tumor size was 2.0 cm (range, 1.0-4.5 cm), and most patients (87.5%) had a single lesion. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year local control (LC) rates were 100%, 94.8%, and 90.7%, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 63.4%, 56.9%, and 24.9%, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 95.6%, 90.9%, and 76.5%, respectively. None of the patients experienced grade 3+ gastrointestinal toxicity, while 1 patient developed non-classic radiation-induced liver disease 2 months after SBRT. CONCLUSION: High-dose SBRT with a \u226548-h interfraction interval after incomplete response to TACE is effective for HCC \u22645 cm in size as evidenced by the high rates of LC and OS and acceptable treatment-related toxicity.",

This study aimed to identify imaging biomarkers of immunotherapy susceptibility linked to gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) and immune phenotypes, particularly immune-excluded phenotypes, with a tumor immune barrier. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical staining with a CD8+ antibody, and samples were classified into immune-inflamed, -intermediate, -excluded, and -ignored phenotypes. We assessed EOB-MRI findings obtained from 104 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC and evaluated the relationship between MRI findings and immune phenotype. Spatial transcriptome analysis of tumor tissues in each immune phenotype was performed to characterize the MRI findings. For validation, we analyzed the treatment effect on 60 nodules in another cohort of 27 patients who received combined immunotherapy using anti-programmed death-ligand 1 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies. RESULTS: HCCs with rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) (odds ratio [OR] 17.3, p = 0.009), peritumoral enhancement in the arterial phase (OR: 8.6, p < 0.004), and intermediate intensity on the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) measured with a visual 3-point scale (OR: 28.2, p = 0.002) were associated with immune-excluded phenotype, where tumors tended to be larger and of the single nodular type with extranodular growth and confluent multinodular rather than the simple nodular type. Spatial transcriptome analysis revealed a spatial relationship among cytotoxic T lymphocytes, VEGF signals, and cancer-associated fibroblasts at the tumor-invasive margins in this phenotype. From the validation study, nodules with any one of these three imaging findings had a significantly prolonged time to-nodular progression (p = 0.007, median not reached vs. 226 days). CONCLUSION: HCCs with rim APHE, peritumoral enhancement in arterial phase, and intermediate intensity on HBP with visual 3-point scale could be non-invasive biomarkers to predict the immune-excluded phenotype with the tumor immune barrier.

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are fundamental in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Considering previous reports implied varied responses among patient subgroups, such as patients with different hepatitis etiologies, we planned this meta-analysis to identify specific populations that might derive greater survival benefits from ICIs as a first-line treatment. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed and the Cochrane Library for phase III clinical trials comparing ICIs and multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) as first-line therapies for advanced HCC. We extracted and synthesized hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival across different patient subgroups mainly using the random-effect model. RESULTS: Our analysis included nine phase III trials involving ICIs, either alone or in combination with other treatments, compared with MKIs. The synthesized HRs for patients with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and nonviral etiologies were 0.74, 0.77, and 0.86, respectively, showing no significant differences (p = 0.13). Such finding remained when we only analyzed clinical trials with positive results. HRs consistently favored ICIs across various demographics such as age, sex, geographic region, performance status, alpha-fetoprotein levels, and disease stage or extent. Notably, patients with extrahepatic spread showed a trend toward better outcomes (HR 0.73) compared to those without (HR 0.85, p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of ICIs as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC was consistent across diverse patient subgroups, regardless of hepatitis etiology or other demographic factors.

However, there is a glaring gap in the research landscape concerning the understanding of what cancer-free status truly means for advanced-stage HCC. Our study sheds light on the profound implications of reaching a cancer-free by radiologic assessments in patients with advanced-stage HCC. METHODS: We established a database tracking the full clinical course of all patients with HCC (from 2003 to 2022). We identified the initial instances of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. We defined radiologic cancer-free (rCF) as cases in which no recurrence was observed for at least 2 months following curative treatment or complete response to systemic therapies. The frequency of achieving rCF status was investigated, categorized by patients' background. RESULTS: We identified 795 patients with advanced-stage HCC. The rCF rate was 8.7%. Patients who achieved rCF status had significantly better prognoses compared to those who did not (p < 0.001). In the decision tree analysis, the number of tumors \u22658 was the strongest factor, making it difficult to achieve rCF status. Analysis of stage progression patterns revealed varying background characteristics at the time of advanced-stage diagnosis, with discrepancies in rCF rates. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low rate of achieving rCF status, the prognostic impact was significant. Patients with certain tumor characteristics had a higher likelihood of achieving rCF status.

We aimed to identify opportunities for oncologists to communicate evidence-based guidance to patients regarding its use. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with cancer seen in radiation oncology clinic between June 2022 and July 2023 were surveyed with a questionnaire regarding their perceptions and information sources of MC. Associations between survey responses and demographic and disease variables were evaluated. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed on narrative responses in search of common themes. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients (84% completion rate) were included in the analysis. Most (83.3%) strongly agreed or agreed that MC can provide symptom relief, whereas a subset of patients (15.5%) strongly agreed or agreed that MC can cure cancer. This latter subcohort was significantly more likely to identify as Hispanic/Latino (38.5% vs 9.9%, P = .009) and less likely to be up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations (30.8% vs 8.5%, P = 0.044). Identifying as Hispanic/Latino remained significantly associated with strongly agreeing or agreeing that MC can cure cancer on bivariate analysis (odds ratio, 6.528; 95% CI, 1.477-28.715; P = .012). Education level, other sociodemographic characteristics, and sources for information about MC were not significantly different between these patients. Thematic analysis revealed that patients hoped to learn more about MC from their oncologists but perceived them to be unknowledgeable on the subject. CONCLUSIONS: Although most patients consider MC to be a valuable addition to conventional therapies for managing refractory symptoms, a subset believed it had potential as an anticancer therapy. Many patients rely on unregulated sources, highlighting the need for providers to address misinformation, bridge knowledge gaps, and clarify its use.",

        "AbstractText": "Formaldehyde (HCHO) is an important air pollutant with direct cancer risk and ozone-forming potential. HCHO sources are complex because HCHO is both directly emitted and produced from oxidation of most gas-phase reactive organic carbon. We update the secondary production of HCHO in the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM) in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Production of HCHO from isoprene and monoterpenes is increased, correcting an underestimate in the current version. Simulated June-August surface HCHO during peak photochemical production (11:00-15:00 LT, local time) increased by 0.6 ppb (32 %) over the southeastern USA and by 0.2 ppb (13 %) over the contiguous USA. The increased HCHO compares more favorably with satellite-based observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and from aircraft-based observations. Evaluation against hourly surface observations indicates a missing nighttime sink that can be improved by increased nighttime deposition, which reduces June-August nocturnal (20:00-04:00 LT) surface HCHO by 1.1 ppb (36 %) over the southeastern USA and 0.5 ppb (29 %) over the contiguous USA. The ability of CRACMM to capture peak levels of HCHO at midday is improved, particularly at sites in the northeastern USA, while peak levels at sites in the southeastern USA are improved, although still lower than observed. Using established risk assessment methods, lifetime exposure of the population in the contiguous USA (~320 million) to ambient HCHO levels predicted here may result in 6200 lifetime cancer cases, with 40 % from controllable anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides and reactive organic compounds.

We aimed to describe the genomic drivers of ALL in an adolescent and young adult (AYA) cohort (ALL06; target age, 15-39 years; recruited age, 16.6-39 years), treated uniformly on a pediatric-inspired protocol (the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group ALL06 study). ALL06 assessed the safety and efficacy of adapting a pediatric chemotherapy protocol in older patients. Genomic risk classification of enrolled B-ALL and T-ALL patients was based on multiple assays: messenger RNA sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetics. Using this approach, 36 of 40 (90%) patients with B-ALL and 13 of 17 (76.5%) patients with T-ALL were classified according to genomic risk. A strong correlation existed between adverse genomic risk and minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of consolidation, translating to inferior overall and relapse free survival. Patients with adverse risk genomics who achieved negative MRD status had improved responses compared with those with persistent MRD. Patients with standard-risk genomics had excellent responses regardless of MRD status. This is the first report of the impact of genomics in an individual cohort of AYA patients treated on a single protocol. These data argue strongly for incorporation of a genomic risk classification into future ALL treatment paradigms at the time of diagnosis, and also for the rigorous assessment of risk assignments in a group of patients who are not children and not older adults.

        "AbstractText": "Pralatrexate (Folotyn) is an antifolate indicated for the treatment of relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and although durable clinical benefit has been demonstrated, oral and gastrointestinal mucositis and/or skin reactions are frequent toxicity complications associated with pralatrexate treatment. Leucovorin (d,l-folinic acid) administration has been used as a standard rescue for patients receiving high-dose methotrexate therapy and has recently been studied in patients with PTCL and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma receiving pralatrexate. We describe results from a multicenter, phase 2, single-arm, open-label trial, conducted with the primary objective of evaluating the effect of leucovorin in preventing or reducing the incidence of grade 2 or higher oral mucositis associated with pralatrexate treatment in cycle 1. Patients were administered pralatrexate, 30\u00a0mg/m2 as an IV push, once weekly for 6\u00a0weeks in each cycle, followed by a week of rest (no treatment). Leucovorin 25\u00a0mg tablets were administered 3 times daily for 2\u00a0days (a total of 6 doses [150\u00a0mg cumulative weekly dose]), initiated 24 hours (\u00b12 hours) after each pralatrexate dose. The evaluable population included 34 patients, with a mean age of 63.7 years and 60% males, of whom 2 (5.9%) developed grade 2 oral mucositis during the study period (P\u00a0< .0001) and there were no reports of grade 3 or higher oral mucositis. Dose modifications, including omissions, delays, or reductions, due to oral mucositis were limited to 1 patient. Coadministration of leucovorin resulted in a significant reduction in mucositis and can be considered a prophylactic therapy in patients receiving pralatrexate treatment.

        "AbstractText": "Recombinant human interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) is an immunotherapeutic agent that enhances natural killer (NK) cells to augment the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of monoclonal antibodies. Mogamulizumab is a CC chemokine receptor 4-directed monoclonal antibody that exerts cytotoxicity through ADCC and depletes regulatory T cells within the tumor microenvironment. We conducted a phase 1 clinical trial of rhIL-15 in combination with mogamulizumab. Patients with relapsed or refractory adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), mycosis fungoides (MF), and Sezary syndrome (SS) received a fixed dose mogamulizumab, combined with escalating doses of rhIL-15 to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Six patients were enrolled, 4 with ATLL and 2 with MF/SS. The most common adverse events were rash, infection, and fever (67% of all). Two patients (33%) had grade 4 acute kidney injury, and in 25% of cycles, grade 3 or higher anemia was present. The MTD was dose level 1. One patient with ATLL had a partial response despite receiving only 4 cycles because of grade 4 myositis. Circulating NK cells were increased in all patients during the first cycle and a rapid reduction in tumor cells within the peripheral circulation was noted. Ex\u00a0vivo assessment demonstrated increased NK cell activation and increased cell lysis in the presence of monoclonal antibodies after only 5\u00a0days. Our small study suggests that rhIL-15, in combination with mogamulizumab, leads to effector NK cell activation and regulatory T-cell depletion but has an unfavorable safety profile. Future development of combinations of immunotherapy that target the microenvironment in relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphomas remains rational.

        "AbstractText": "The development of targeted agents for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has transformed the treatment paradigm for patients with CLL. Because of this evolving treatment landscape, contemporaneous evidence was needed related to US treatment patterns and outcomes among patients treated in the real-world. Using COTA's electronic health records-based database, we examined characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes of patients receiving \u22652 lines of therapy (LOTs). A total of 1283 adult patients with CLL were identified who initiated second LOT (2L) between 1 January 2014 and 30 June 2022. Of those patients, 542 (42.2%) later received third-line (3L) therapy, of whom 228 (42.1%) went on to receive fourth-line (4L) therapy. Overall, >18% of patients died after 2L initiation and before 3L initiation, and more than a quarter died before 4L initiation. Most patients were White (77.7%), male (60.6%), aged \u226565 years (68.8%), and treated in a community practice setting (87.8%). From 2014 to 2023, the use of chemoimmunotherapy in any \u22652L LOT decreased, whereas use of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor and B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor therapy increased. Across endpoints, median times to event(s) were generally shorter with each subsequent LOT received, both in the overall population and among patients receiving a given therapy in different LOTs. With a median follow-up time from 2L initiation of 38.0\u00a0months, median real-world time to next treatment, progression-free survival, and overall survival was 31.9, 33.8, and 80.1\u00a0months, respectively.

        "AbstractText": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has significantly improved management of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. However, manufacturing failure due to poor cell growth necessitates revision of treatment strategies that negatively impact patients. To identify risk factors for CAR-T manufacturing failure in patients with myeloma, a nationwide cohort study was performed, analyzing patients who underwent apheresis for idecabtagene vicleucel in Japan. Of 154 patients analyzed, 13 cases (8.4%) experienced manufacturing failure. We compared clinical factors between patients with manufacturing failure (failed group) and those who met specifications (successful group). Patients in the failed group had a higher prevalence of deletion 17p at diagnosis (38.5% vs 14.9%), were more likely to have been treated with alkylating agents within 6\u00a0months before apheresis (53.8% vs 23.4%), and had undergone more chemotherapy lines before apheresis (median, 6 vs 5). Additionally, patients with manufacturing failure exhibited significantly lower hemoglobin levels (8.6 vs 10.0 g/dL), platelet counts (5.9\u00a0\u00d7 104/\u03bcL vs 13.8\u00a0\u00d7 104/\u03bcL), and CD4/CD8 ratios (0.169 vs 0.474) than patient with successful manufacturing. Multivariate analysis revealed that low platelet counts (odds ratio [OR], 0.130 for every increase of 105/\u03bcL; P\u00a0= .041), or low CD4/CD8 ratios (OR, 0.100 for each doubling; P\u00a0= .003) at apheresis increased the risk of manufacturing failure. Alkylating agents within 6\u00a0months before apheresis were associated with decreased platelet counts and CD4/CD8 ratios. Manufacturing failure remains an obstacle to CAR-T therapy for patients with myeloma. Avoiding risk factors, such as alkylating agents, and adopting risk-adapted strategies may optimize CAR-T therapy for patients with myeloma.",

        "AbstractText": "For many rare diseases with no approved preventive interventions, promising interventions exist. However, it has proven difficult to conduct a pivotal phase 3 trial that could provide direct evidence demonstrating a beneficial effect of the intervention on the target disease outcome. When a promising putative surrogate endpoint(s) for the target outcome is available, surrogate-based provisional approval of an intervention may be pursued. Following the general Causal Roadmap rubric, we describe a surrogate endpoint-based provisional approval causal roadmap. Based on an observational study data set and a phase 3 randomized trial data set, this roadmap defines an approach to analyze the combined data set to draw a conservative inference about the treatment effect (TE) on the target outcome in the phase 3 study population. The observational study enrolls untreated individuals and collects baseline covariates, surrogate endpoints, and the target outcome, and is used to estimate the surrogate index-the regression of the target outcome on the surrogate endpoints and baseline covariates. The phase 3 trial randomizes participants to treated vs. untreated and collects the same data but is much smaller and hence very underpowered to directly assess TE, such that inference on TE is based on the surrogate index. This inference is made conservative by specifying 2 bias functions: one that expresses an imperfection of the surrogate index as a surrogate endpoint in the phase 3 study, and the other that expresses imperfect transport of the surrogate index in the untreated from the observational to the phase 3 study. Plug-in and nonparametric efficient one-step estimators of TE, with inferential procedures, are developed. The finite-sample performance of the estimators is evaluated in simulation studies. The causal roadmap is motivated by and illustrated with contemporary Group B Streptococcus vaccine development.",

        "AbstractText": "Causal mediation, pleiotropy, and replication analyses are three highly popular genetic study designs. Although these analyses address different scientific questions, the underlying statistical inference problems all involve large-scale testing of composite null hypotheses. The goal is to determine whether all null hypotheses - as opposed to at least one - in a set of individual tests should simultaneously be rejected. Recently, various methods have been proposed for each of these situations, including an appealing two-group empirical Bayes approach that calculates local false discovery rates (lfdr). However, lfdr estimation is difficult due to the need for multivariate density estimation. Furthermore, the multiple testing rules for the empirical Bayes lfdr approach can disagree with conventional frequentist z-statistics, which is troubling for a field that ubiquitously utilizes summary statistics. This work proposes a framework to unify two-group testing in genetic association composite null settings, the conditionally symmetric multidimensional Gaussian mixture model (csmGmm). The csmGmm is shown to demonstrate more robust operating characteristics than recently-proposed alternatives. Crucially, the csmGmm also offers interpretability guarantees by harmonizing lfdr and z-statistic testing rules. We extend the base csmGmm to cover each of the mediation, pleiotropy, and replication settings, and we prove that the lfdr z-statistic agreement holds in each situation. We apply the model to a collection of translational lung cancer genetic association studies that motivated this work.",

Patients face a higher risk of mortality in the period of transition from failing allograft to dialysis. Long term risk of cardiovascular complications and risk of infections and cancer with use of long-term immune suppression contribute to poor outcomes. Patients with failing transplants appear to have poorer control of CKD complications and are more likely to initiate hemodialysis using a catheter. Outcomes of peritoneal dialysis in the setting of the failing allograft in general are equivalent to hemodialysis. Management of these patients in transplant center clinics specifically focused on patients with failing allografts may have benefit, but maximal utility has yet to be demonstrated. Patients with failed transplants can have a survival benefit with retransplant, even in older patients. There may not be a benefit to retransplant in patients older than 70 years of age. Patients with failing renal grafts should be assessed as to whether they are potential candidates for retransplant prior to needing to start dialysis to allow for identification of a living kidney donor or to be listed as soon a possible on the kidney transplant wait list as to minimize the wait time on dialysis. Decisions regarding reduction of immunosuppression once the patient has started dialysis should be made with guidance from the transplant center in the context of patient-centric factors such as candidacy for retransplant and minimizing complications of long-term immunosuppression.",

Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) offers a minimally invasive alternative to neck dissection for identifying occult metastases. This review aims to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence-guided SLNB for HNCs. METHODS: Systematic searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were conducted to identify all clinical articles on ICG-guided SLNB in HNC from database inception through May 1, 2022. Numerous variables were extracted across papers, including patient and study characteristics, imaging parameters, and SLN detection rates. Risk of bias was evaluated via the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria. RESULTS: A final six studies met inclusion criteria, encompassing 86 distinct head and neck tumors. The mean number of SLNs identified was 2.46 for fluorescence imaging and 2.83 for gamma tracing. Fluorescence imaging exhibited a higher pooled SLN detection rate (98.0%) compared to gamma tracing (87.6%). Pooled sensitivity for fluorescence imaging (71.0%) was also determined to be higher than that for gamma tracing (66.7%). Pooled specificity was 100% across both modalities. Studies were assessed to be of moderate quality by the MINORS criteria, with an average score of 11.25 for noncomparative studies and 20.5 for comparative studies. CONCLUSIONS: ICG-guided SLNB procedures are feasible and effective in the context of HNCs. The technique offers potentially higher SLN detection rates and shows promise in enhancing clinical and oncologic outcomes when compared to standard lymphoscintigraphy. Further studies with standardized metrics are, however, needed to validate these findings and identify optimal imaging techniques and parameters.",

The rise of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy as the favored surgical approach emphasizes the significance of localization studies. This study aims to explore clinical and laboratory profiles of PHP patients and evaluate the efficacy of diverse localization methods in a substantial patient cohort. METHODS: We analyzed clinical features, biochemical parameters, and imaging outcomes for localization, as well as postoperative histopathological findings in 327 diagnosed PHP patients who underwent surgery. Initial localization methods, which included ultrasonography (US), US-guided Parathormone (PTH) washout analysis, and 99mTechnetium-Sestamibi/123Iodine Scintigraphy (MIBI-SPECT/CT), were applied to all patients. Advanced techniques like Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography (4D-CT) and 18F-Fluorocholine Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FCH PET/CT) were used for cases where initial methods failed and/or for secondary intervention. RESULTS: Minimally invasive surgery accounted for 74% (n=241) of cases. Histopathological analysis revealed single adenoma in 94.5% (n=309) patients, hyperplasia in 5.2% (n=17), and cancer in 0.3% (n=1). Adenoma volume showed a significant positive correlation with serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (p<0.001). 82 and 26 cases required 4D-CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT respectively, for localization. Positive predictive values (PPV) for imaging modalities were: US (84.56%), US-guided PTH-washout analysis (87.30%), MIBI-SPECT/CT (92.1%), 4D-CT (81.94%), and 18F-FCH PET/CT (95.83%). CONCLUSION: Serum calcium and PTH levels estimate adenoma size. Initial localization studies (i.e.US, PTH washout and, MIBI-SPECT/CT) effectively localized most adenomas. 4D-CT showed notable efficacy, and 18F-FCH PET/CT had the highest PPV for adenoma localization when the initial studies failed.",

Sanger sequencing was used to validate the familial heredity. For the novel variant, protein predictive analysis was performed to study the changes of secondary and tertiary structures and hydrophobicity. RESULTS: A 45 years old male (proband, III-1) was diagnosed as PBMAH. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed, finding one mutation: c.719_ 724dup, p Arg240_ Pro241dup. Sanger sequencing showed the II-2, III-1, IV-1 with heterozygous gene, confirming the familial heredity. For protein predictive analysis, the predicted secondary structure of variants has one alpha-helix structure incomplete compared with normal ARMC5. The tertiary structure could draw the same conclusion, that hydrophobicity decreases after mutation.

Reoperation is a standard treatment but may be challenging due to the formation of fibrosis, cervical anatomy distortion, and the small size of recurrent lesions. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive modality for recurrent thyroid cancer in high-risk patients or those who refuse surgery. Here, we describe the case of a 41-year-old woman who underwent total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection because of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Follow-up ultrasonography 14 months after the second surgery revealed two abnormal lymph nodes in the right neck at level VI. She underwent RFA of the lymph nodes. Eighteen months after RFA, the metastasis lymph nodes disappeared completely.",

        "AbstractText": "Objective \u2003The aim of this study was to explore an innovative approach for developing deep learning (DL) algorithm for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) detection and subtyping on computed tomography (CT): clear cell RCC (ccRCC) versus non-ccRCC using two-dimensional (2D) neural network architecture and feature consistency modules. Materials and Methods \u2003This retrospective study included baseline CT scans from 196 histopathologically proven RCC patients: 143 ccRCCs and 53 non-ccRCCs. Manual tumor annotations were performed on axial slices of corticomedullary phase images, serving as ground truth. After image preprocessing, the dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing subsets. The study tested multiple 2D DL architectures, with the FocalNet-DINO demonstrating highest effectiveness in detecting and classifying RCC. The study further incorporated spatial and class consistency modules to enhance prediction accuracy. Models' performance was evaluated using free-response receiver operating characteristic curves, recall rates, specificity, accuracy, F1 scores, and area under the curve (AUC) scores. Results \u2003The FocalNet-DINO architecture achieved the highest recall rate of 0.823 at 0.025 false positives per image (FPI) for RCC detection. The integration of spatial and class consistency modules into the architecture led to 0.2% increase in recall rate at 0.025 FPI, along with improvements of 0.1% in both accuracy and AUC scores for RCC classification. These enhancements allowed detection of cancer in an additional 21 slices and reduced false positives in 126 slices. Conclusion \u2003This study demonstrates high performance for RCC detection and classification using DL algorithm leveraging 2D neural networks and spatial and class consistency modules, to offer a novel, computationally simpler, and accurate DL approach to RCC characterization.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is one of the most common biliary cancers and is characterized by its high malignancy. Moreover, the incidence of GBC has been increasing over the decades, partly due to advancements in diagnostic techniques and devices. The purpose of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive assessment of factors influencing the prognosis of GBC. We aim to identify and evaluate both established and controversial prognostic factors, including lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), adjuvant therapy, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA199), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), tumor mutation status, surgical margins, the presence of gallstones, and jaundice. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of eligible studies in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Our analysis focused on data from GBC patients who had undergone surgical resection, with the primary outcome being overall survival. Forest plots were generated using hazard ratios (HRs) to visualize the effect sizes, and the Quality in Prognostic Factor Studies (QUIPS) tool was employed to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS: This study synthesized data from 52 studies, encompassing a total of 23,174 patients over the period of 2000 to 2022. Notably, several factors significantly influenced the outcomes of GBC, including LMR (HR =2.17), CEA (HR =1.81), CA199 (HR =1.56), lymph node stage (HR =2.03), T stage (HR =2.37), presence of invasion (HR =1.74), tumor location (HR =1.42), and surgical margins (HR =2.66). Additionally, chemotherapy (HR =0.75) and radiotherapy (HR =0.56) demonstrated marked improvements in overall survival compared to control arms. Jaundice and the presence of gallstones were not defined as independent predictors, as they reflect advanced stage symptoms in GBC. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this comprehensive review offer valuable insights into the assessment of the necessity for aggressive treatment approaches and the prognostication of GBC patients. Furthermore, there is a need for well-designed, ongoing studies to further advance our understanding of this challenging malignancy.",

Immunotherapy is an emerging approach to regulating the immune system to fight cancer and has shown therapeutic potential. Due to their immunogenicity, bacteria have been developed as drug-delivery vehicles in cancer immunotherapy. However, ensuring the safety and efficacy of this approach poses a considerable challenge. This paper comprehensively explains the fundamental processes and synthesis principles involved in immunotherapy utilizing engineered bacteria. Initially, we list common engineered strains and discuss that growth control through genetic mutation promises therapeutic safety. By considering the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and the interaction of specific molecules, the precision targeting of tumors can be improved. Furthermore, we present a foundational paradigm for genetic circuit construction to achieve controlled gene activation and logical expression, directly determining drug synthesis and release. Finally, we review the immunogenicity, the expression of immunomodulatory factors, the delivery of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and the utilization of bacteria as tumor vaccines to stimulate the immune system and facilitate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.",

Rippled-pattern BCC has been documented in fewer than ten cases, though this may also be attributed to confusion regarding nomenclature. Microscopically, rippled-pattern BCC exhibits distinctive features that differentiates it from other patterns. The tumor cells form interconnected networks or cords with intervening mucinous spaces within a fibrotic stroma resulting in a rippled appearance. As they are generally considered nodular BCCs, management of rippled-pattern BCCs can involve surgical excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, or other appropriate treatment modalities based on the tumor's location, size, and degree of invasion.`.",

However, nearly all case series of PCTs to date evaluate cohorts in years before 2010. Because an increased volume of cross-sectional imaging studies results in more frequent detection of incidental lung nodules, we sought to evaluate whether the nature of this cancer's clinical characteristics may be evolving by studying a contemporary series of patients. METHODS: The study analyzed all patients with a diagnosis of PCT at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (Philadelphia, PA) between 2006 and 2020. The study evaluated tumor location within the bronchial tree (ie, central or peripheral), the presence or absence of symptoms at diagnosis, patient demographics, and nodule characteristics on computed tomography. RESULTS: A total of 73 PCTs were analyzed in 72 patients. Most PCTs were detected incidentally (48 of 72; 95% CI: 55%-77%) and located peripherally (41 of 67; 95% CI: 49%-73%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the likelihood of PCTs having these features increased over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: PCTs manifested predominantly as peripheral lung lesions detected incidentally on computed tomography, which contrasts with the existing literature. This may reflect the changing nature of PCT diagnosis as cross-sectional imaging volume has increased. Clinicians should be mindful that incidental solitary pulmonary nodules detected on chest imaging may represent PCT, especially if the lesions are slow growing.",

This study aimed to analyze outcomes with sublobar resection in patients with clinical T1N0M0 LCNEC (<3 cm) compared with lobectomy. METHODS: We performed a single-institution, retrospective study comparing patients undergoing lobectomy vs sublobar resection (segmentectomy or wedge resection) for clinical T1N0M0 LCNEC from 2002 2022. We performed unmatched and propensity-matched comparisons for overall survival and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: During the study period, 62 lobectomies and 34 sublobar resections (20 segmentectomies and 14 wedge resections) were performed for clinical T1N0M0 LCNEC. Correct pre-/intraoperative histologic diagnosis was made only for 21 patients receiving lobectomy (33.9%) and 10 patients receiving sublobar resection (29.4%). In the unmatched cohort, there was no difference in overall survival (median, 65.6 vs 65.4 months; P = .133) and recurrence-free survival (median, 36.9 vs 31.1 months; P = .210). Sublobar resection was associated with a higher locoregional recurrence rate (44.1% vs 14.5%; P = .003), while the overall recurrence rate was not significantly different (50.0% vs 37.1%; P = .280). In the matched cohort with 22 patients on each arm, there was no difference in overall survival (median, 65.6 vs 57.8 months; P = .308) and recurrence-free survival (median 27.1 vs 20.4 months; P = .290). CONCLUSIONS: LCNEC is a diagnostic challenge with pre-/intra-operative biopsy. For cT1N0M0 LCNEC, even though the survival was not inferior, sublobar resection could be inferior in long-term locoregional disease control.

To reduce the delay between diagnosis and treatment, we initiated a Robotic One Anesthetic Diagnosis and Treatment (ROADAT) program for lung nodules that combined robotic navigational bronchoscopy, liquid rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), and surgical resection in the same setting. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent the ROADAT procedure from December 1, 2021, through January 31, 2024. These patients were compared with sequential controls from the same time window, who would have been ROADAT candidates but underwent diagnosis and treatment using a standard lung nodule workup. RESULTS: There were 36 patients in the ROADAT group and 35 controls. Of the 36 ROADAT patients, 31 (86%) underwent lung resections. When final pathology was available, ROSE was concordant in 91% (29 of 32) of cases. Compared with robotic lobectomies alone, ROADAT procedures that resulted in lobectomies added 73 minutes (P = .003). However, total operating room time for when lobectomy and biopsy were done in separate settings was 54 minutes shorter in the ROADAT group (P = .028). Direct (ROADAT, $19,244; controls, $21,737; P = .004) procedure costs and total (ROADAT, $26,668; controls, $29,882; P = .005) procedure costs were lower in the ROADAT group for patients who underwent lobectomy.

Clinicopathologic and computed tomography (CT) findings were retrospectively investigated, and predictors of anastomotic complications were analyzed. The CT finding of azygos arch invasion was defined as a compression or stenosis of the azygos arch by the tumor. RESULTS: Lobectomy types were right upper lobectomy in 71 patients, right lower lobectomy in 5, left upper lobectomy in 53, and left lower lobectomy in 11. CT finding of azygos arch invasion was detected in 21 cases. Anastomotic coverage was performed in 41. Bronchial anastomotic complications were observed in 11 patients (7.9%), including 9 with an anastomotic fistula and 2 with stenosis, all of which were on the right side. Only right upper sleeve lobectomy was a significant predictor of anastomotic complications (odds ratio, 5.29; 95% CI, 1.07-26.13).

We evaluated outcomes after implementing a survivorship approach based on a cancer survivorship clinic model to improve quality of life (QoL) and optimize resource consumption. METHODS: We established a multidisciplinary survivorship clinic using telehealth and in-person physical and occupational therapy teams. Data from the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) were collected between 2020 and 2023. Interviews were conducted at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after decannulation. The patients were offered in-person and telephone-based counseling with scheduled inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation visits. SF-12 mental component summary (MCS-12) and physical component summary (PCS-12) scores were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The relationship between QoL, costs, and length of stay outcomes was assessed using generalized linear and mixed models. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were monitored for 3 years. Mean age was 41.7 years, 98.1% were White, and 50.9% were men. At 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, mean MSC-12 scores were 52.9, 50, and 49.7, PCS-12 scores were 43.7, 41.8, and 47.3, and QALYs were 0.837, 0.829, and 0.826, respectively. MCS-12 showed no significant difference from the United States population. PCS-12 was significantly lower than the United States population during the first and second evaluations (P < .001) but showed no difference at 36 months. QALYs were significantly higher (P < .001). Higher resource consumption was associated with lower PCS-12 scores and QALYs.

The variability in the location of T2 and T3 ganglia in relation to the ribs may contribute to inconsistent clinical outcomes after ETS. METHODS: For the cadaver study, adult human cadaveric thoraces were dissected to map the locations of T2 and T3 ganglia by identifying their white rami communicantes. For the ETS group, T3 ganglionectomy ETS was performed. Surgical outcome and postoperative incidence of compensatory sweating were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 74 pediatric patients underwent thoracoscopic T3 ganglionectomy. All patients were satisfied with the surgical outcomes. No patients complained of compensatory sweating. Forty cadavers were dissected: 25 adult female and 15 adult male. The findings showed that a high percentage of T2 ganglia are near the superior border of the third rib, while the T3 ganglion is near the fourth rib. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the proximity of the T2 ganglion to the third rib, accidental thermal injury to the T2 ganglion may occur when third rib-oriented ETS is performed. A ganglion-oriented T3 ETS can be accomplished by using the white ramus communicans as a guide to accurately locate the T3 ganglion.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Some patients are candidates for either surgical resection or stereotactic body radiotherapy for treatment of stage I lung cancer. We refined a previously developed decision tool about this treatment choice and evaluated interest in a personalized risk calculator. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews from October 2023 to May 2024 with patients who had been treated for stage I lung cancer at a Midwestern comprehensive cancer center and with clinicians who treat such patients. RESULTS: Participants responded positively to the tool and indicated that it could support decisions if provided before or during conversations following diagnosis. There was no consensus on which clinician should deliver the tool. Suggested tool adaptations focused on clarifying eligibility for options and accurately describing the range of patients' recovery experiences. Participants were open to the idea of a personalized risk calculator but expressed concerns about accuracy and interpretation of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Decision tools can help clinicians and patients collaborate on care decisions. Future work will explore opportunities to incorporate personalized risk information and evaluate this decision tool with a diverse group of patients deciding on treatment for stage I lung cancer.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Minimally Invasive and Cost-Effective Access to Deep-Seated Intracranial Lesions Using 19F Peel-Away Sheath Introducer and \"Dynamic\" Retraction: Technical Note and a Case Series.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Minimally invasive (MIS) techniques for resection of deep-seated brain lesions (DSL) have become widespread in the past 2 decades. Various devices for endoscopic and open microscopic procedures are now common in many institutions. Most setups use image-guided tubular brain retractors inserted along the paths sparing the eloquent cortical and subcortical structures. The cost of the commercially available retractors may be significant, making them unaffordable in the developing world and even in countries with well-developed economies. The authors introduce a novel, cost-effective technique involving the use of the 19F peel-away sheath introducer and subsequent \"dynamic\" retraction to remove DSL. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a new MIS technique in patients with various cerebral pathologies. METHODS: We report on 13 patients who underwent transcortical resection of the DSL. Six patients (46%) had the diagnosis of glioblastoma (2 of which were recurrent). The remaining 7 patients had metastases (3 cases), cavernous malformation (2 cases), thalamic pilocytic astrocytoma, and colloid cyst of the third ventricle. RESULTS: All 13 patients underwent aggressive resection of the brain lesions without any complications, except one 37-year old patient with large left basal ganglia glioblastoma experienced worsening of the contralateral hemiparesis and transient expressive aphasia, which improved the baseline over 4 weeks after surgery. Gross total resection was achieved in 11 of the 13 cases after the initial surgery. CONCLUSION: The described MIS technique appears safe, technically feasible, and cost-effective alternative to the commonly used tubular retraction systems. The use of \"dynamic\" retraction through narrow surgical tract may become a viable surgical option in patients with deep-seated lesions. It could serve as an affordable alternative to the commercially available systems, particularly in medical centers with limited resources.",

        "AbstractText": "People who inject drugs (PWID) have an increased risk of HIV infection partly due to injection behaviors often related to opioid use. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) have been shown to reduce HIV infection risk, possibly by reducing injection risk behaviors. MOUD may benefit individuals who do not receive it themselves but are connected through social, sexual, or drug use networks with individuals who are treated. This is known as spillover. Valid estimation of spillover in network studies requires considering the network's community structure. Communities are groups of densely connected individuals with sparse connections to other groups. We analyzed a network of 277 PWID and their contacts from the Transmission Reduction Intervention Project. We assessed the effect of MOUD on reductions in injection risk behaviors and the possible benefit for network contacts of participants treated with MOUD. We identified communities using modularity-based methods and employed inverse probability weighting with community-level propensity scores to adjust for measured confounding. We found that MOUD may have beneficial spillover effects on reducing injection risk behaviors. The magnitudes of estimated effects were sensitive to the community detection method. Careful consideration should be paid to the significance of community structure in network studies evaluating spillover.",

        "AbstractText": "Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is overexpressed in various tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and is rarely expressed in normal tissues. These characteristics make DDR1 a preferable target candidate for the construction of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for targeted therapy. Here, we investigated the preparation and preclinical efficacy of DDR1-DX8951, an ADC that includes an anti-DDR1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to DX8951 by a cleavable Gly-Gly-Phe-Gly (GGFG) linker. The anti-DDR1 monoclonal antibody was coupled to DX8951 (i.e., DDR1-DX8951), producing the targeted therapy ADC. The antitumor activities of DDR1-DX8951 monotherapy or DDR1-DX8951 plus pembrolizumab were assessed in TNBC mouse models. DDR1-DX8951 can specifically target DDR1, be quickly internalized by TNBC cells, and reduce the viability of TNBC cells in vitro. The potent antitumor activity of DDR1-DX8951 was revealed in TNBC xenograft models. Importantly, our investigation demonstrated that DDR1-DX8951 plus pembrolizumab not only revealed the inhibitory efficacy on tumor growth and metastasis but also played an important role in improving the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of TNBC. Taken together, this investigation provides justification for large-sample studies to further assess the safety and efficacy of DDR1-DX8951 plus pembrolizumab for TNBC clinical trials.",

Materials and Methods This prospective observational study included 74 patients in whom quantitative CEUS analysis and Doppler ultrasound were performed early after kidney transplantation (10\u00b16 days). For each region of interest (ROI) the time-to-peak intensity (TTP) and the respective delta between ROIs within interlobar artery, cortex, and medulla were compared. Results were correlated with kidney function at the time of imaging and six months later. Results Patients with an eGFR<30 ml/min at the time of investigation had significantly slower cortical enhancement with a longer cortical TTP (cTTP: 16.1\u00b10.9 vs. 11.7\u00b10.7 sec, p<0.001), as well as a significant delay between the arterial and cortical phases (c-a), as shown in longer \u2206TTP (c-a): 8.2\u00b10.9 vs. 4.2\u2009\u00b1 0.5 sec, p<0.001. There was a significant negative correlation between cTTP and eGFR with a correlation coefficient of -0.37 (p<0.001), as well as between \u2206TTP (c-a) and eGFR with a correlation coefficient of -0.40 (p<0.001). Reduced kidney function after 6 months correlated significantly with the findings of the initial CEUS examination (p=0.005, correlation coefficient -0.39). Conclusion CEUS revealed significant differences in temporal enhancement dynamics in patients with reduced kidney function after transplantation. Quantitative CEUS might therefore be able to depict graft function regarding microvascular damage and be of prognostic value regarding long-term renal outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "The well-documented protumorigenic roles of macrophages in advanced cancers can sometimes overshadow their beneficial functions in the earlier stages of tumor development. This essay explores the hypothesis that macrophages play a crucial protective role in premalignant tissues by sensing and responding to early oncogenic transformation. Their activity is closely intertwined with cell-intrinsic barriers to transformation - such as apoptosis, senescence, and DNA repair - which collectively work to suppress malignant progression. Thus, an integrated cell-intrinsic and macrophage response constitutes effective 'oncogenic monitoring'. In premalignant tissues, macrophages interpret outputs of cell-intrinsic tumor suppression as oncogenic stress signals detected through innate immune sensors, initiating a protective, homeostatic response that mitigates potential progression to malignancy. By recontextualizing macrophage roles in the early immune landscape, it becomes evident that these cells can serve as key protectors, preventing or delaying tumor formation. Understanding this dual role of macrophages - protective in early tumorigenesis and protumorigenic in established cancers - offers new perspectives on harnessing their immune functions for cancer prevention and therapy.",

Therefore, this study made an effort to know health-seeking behavior among delayed cancer patients receiving treatment at a tertiary care hospital, Varanasi. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Surgical Oncology OPD, Sir Sunder Lal Hospital, IMS, BHU, Varanasi. Randomly selected 440 registered patients were interviewed with the help of semi-structured questionnaire. Binary logistic regression analysis and 2-test were used in this study. RESULTS: Out of total 440 patients included in this study, 207 (47.05%) were males and 233 (52.95%) were females. The majority (59.32%) of patients were more than 45 years of age group. Most (80%) of the patients had delay in cancer treatment of more than 60 days from onset of symptoms. Only 29.55% of patients were aware of any symptoms of Cancer. Those patients who were doing self-medication (P=0.03) and did not attend any cancer screening program (P=0.04) showed a statistically significant association with delayed initiation of treatment. Patients referred from another centre (P = 0.03) also show a significant association with delayed treatment initiation. Cancer patients who visited the screening program (AOR= 0.22, P=0.003) were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of delayed treatment initiation. CONCLUSION: The study showed that 80% of patients were delayed in seeking treatment for Cancer and highly influenced by low awareness, self-medication and visiting multiple health centres for diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, there is a strong need to address the reasons for the delay in seeking treatment.",

The standard tracer is technetium colloid ( 99m Tc). Indocyanine green (ICG) can be used as an alternative. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this fluorescent dye in a standardized setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, single-center cohort study carried out at the University Gynecological Hospital of Rostock from September 2023 to May 2024 carried out sentinel lymph node marking using only ICG in patients with breast malignancies. The ICG injection was administered immediately after the induction of anesthesia. Detection of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) was done using a laparoscopy system suitable for ICG. The aim was to determine the detection rate (DR) for SLNs marked exclusively using ICG and to record any complications. The costs of using ICG to mark SLNs were compared with those for 99m Tc marking. RESULTS: During the study period, contraindications against marking with ICG were ascertained for five (3.8%) of 132 patients with planned SLNE. A total of 100 SLNEs were carried out after ICG marking in patients who met the inclusion criteria in the context of the study. A median of two SLNs were resected. The detection rate (DR) for SLNs was 98.0%. SLNs were identified in all obese patients. No serious systemic side effects occurred following ICG injection. Transient skin discoloration in the area around the injection site were observed in eight patients. The direct cost of ICG marking was 62.73 Euros, which was 170.36 Euros lower than the cost of 99m Tc marking. CONCLUSION: The detection rate of axillary SLNs marked using ICG is high and the method is cost-effective, has few side effects and can also be used in obese patients. Contraindications against the administration of ICG are rare. Marking with ICG is a good alternative to the 99m Tc method and offers advantages in terms of costs, logistics, no exposure to radiation, and patient comfort.",

This study aims to identify the incidence and causes of in-hospital mortality in elderly patients after elective spine surgery. METHODS: We extracted the data of patients aged \u226565 years who underwent elective spine surgery between December 12, 2016, and May 31, 2022, from our prospective multicenter cohort. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate. Univariate analysis was conducted to identify potential risk factors for postoperative mortality. The detailed clinical course of patients who died was retrospectively investigated using medical records. RESULTS: A total of 10,976 eligible patients (5,976 males and 5,000 females), with a mean age of 75.5 years, were identified. There were eight in-hospital deaths (0.07%). Univariate analyses showed that the eight patients were significantly older (82.1 years vs. 75.5 years, P=0.008), were more frequently hemodialysis-dependent (50.0% vs. 2.9%, P<0.001), and had a higher proportion of cases with cervical surgery (62.5% vs. 17.0%, P<0.001) and preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status \u22653 (87.5% vs. 14.6%, P<0.001). Death occurred at a median of 24.5 days postoperatively. The causes of in-hospital death were as follows: gastrointestinal diseases in five cases (ischemic colitis in three cases, panperitonitis in one, and intestinal perforation in one), sepsis due to unknown causes in two, and lethal arrhythmia in one. The initial symptoms preceding the lethal clinical course were mainly common gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of in-hospital mortality was gastrointestinal disease.

This study aimed to compare the vascular biomarker profile of PTCy with other GVHD regimens, including Tacrolimus/Sirolimus (Tac/Sir) and Tacrolimus/Methotrexate (Tac/MTX), to generate hypotheses for toxicity mitigation strategies. Plasma samples from day +28 post-transplant were analyzed against pre-transplant baseline measurements in patients receiving PTCy-based GVHD prophylaxis as part of BMT CTN (Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network) 1202 (N=112), versus Tac/MTX (N=98) and Tac/Sir (N=95) regimens from BMT CTN 0402. Compared to Tac/MTX, PTCy was associated with increasing angiopoietin-2 levels and decreasing epidermal growth factor levels at day +28. In contrast, Tac/Sir displayed increasing follistatin and endoglin levels and decreasing VEGFR2 plasma levels after HCT. Across all cohorts, increasing epidermal growth factor (EGF) was protective from non-relapse mortality, and decreasing VEGFR2 was associated with subsequent development of extensive chronic GVHD. These distinct biomarker profiles offer insights that could guide strategies to mitigate unique GVHD prophylaxis-associated toxicities.",

Patients with chronic intestinal inflammation have an approximately 2-3 folds increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Unfortunately, there is currently no effective intervention available. Huangqin decoction (HQD), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, is frequently clinically prescribed for treating patients with colitis, and its active ingredients have effective antitumour efficacy. Nonetheless, the mechanism of HQD-mediated prevention of colorectal inflammatory cancer transformation remains unclear. A strategy integrating metagenomic, lipidomic, and messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing analysis was used to investigate the regulatory effects of HQD on the gut microbiome, metabolism and potential mechanisms involved in colorectal inflammatory cancer transformation. Our study revealed that HQD suppressed colorectal inflammatory cancer transformation, which was associated with enhanced intestinal barrier function, decreased the inflammatory response, and regulation of the gut microbiome. Notably, cohousing experiments revealed that the transfer of the gut microbiome from HQD-treated mice largely inhibited the pathological transformation of colitis. Moreover, gut microbiome transfer from HQD-treated mice primarily resulted in the altered regulation of fatty acid metabolism, especially the remodeling of arachidonic acid metabolism, which was associated with the amelioration of pathological transformation. Arachidonic acid metabolism and the key metabolic enzyme arachidonic acid 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) were affected by HQD treatment, and no obvious protective effect of HQD was observed in Alox 12 -/- mice, which revealed that ALOX12 was a critical mediator of HQD protection against colorectal inflammatory cancer transformation. In summary, multiple omics analyses were applied to produce valuable data and theoretical support for the application of HQD as a promising intervention for the transformation of inflammatory CRC.",

The risk factors for gastric cancer include both uncontrollable (e.g., age, sex, and genetic predisposition) and controllable factors (e.g., Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and high-salt diets). Although treatment of H. pylori infections has been implemented as a primary preventive measure, the risk of gastric cancer may persist, highlighting the need for additional preventive measures. This review discusses various risks and protective factors associated with gastric cancer, studies conducted on these factors, and chemoprevention. Smoking is a risk factor for this disease; thus, is not recommended and current smokers are encouraged to quit because cessation can reduce the risk of gastric cancer. Excessive alcohol intake has been reported to increase the risk of gastric cancer as has the consumption of high-salt foods that can damage the gastric mucosa.

METHODS: Between January 2014 and June 2022, a total of 573 patients with gastric cancer, including 130 with Siewert type II/III EGC, underwent total gastrectomies at the Kosin University Gospel Hospital. Factors associated with LNM were analyzed using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 130 patients with Siewert type II/III EGC, 10 (7.7%) demonstrated LNM (LNM-positive group). Macroscopically elevated lesions (I+IIa) (60.0% vs. 16.7%; p=0.009) and lymphovascular invasion (70.0% vs. 5.8%; p<0.001) were more common and the depth of invasion was deeper (p=0.003) in the LNM-positive patients than in the LNMnegative group. Multivariate analysis showed that macroscopically elevated lesions (odds ratio [OR], 19.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.93-197.11; p=0.012) and lymphovascular invasion (OR, 52.63; 95% CI, 5.26-526.51; p=0.001) were associated with LNM. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the 5-year overall and disease-specific survival rates of patients with Siewert type II/III EGC were 90.0% and 98.9%, respectively. During a median follow-up period of 49 months (range, 12-122 months), one patient (0.8%) died owing to gastric cancer recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Siewert type II/III EGC showed favorable long-term outcomes. Macroscopically elevated lesions and lymphovascular invasion are associated with LNM.",

        "AbstractText": "Gastric cancer (GC), a significant cause of mortality globally, is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among Latin American men. GC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage; therefore, therapeutic options are limited, and prognosis is poor. Helicobacter pylori infection remains the primary risk factor for GC; therefore, primary prevention directed toward diagnosis and treatment (\"test-and-treat\" strategy) is important. Western medicine guidelines recommend esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for at-risk individuals aged >40 years with regular surveillance in patients with gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC). However, limited availability of EGD in Latin America necessitates development of risk stratification tools to minimize the endoscopic burden. Results from the Chilean \"Endoscopic Cohort and Histological Operative Link on Gastric Assessment (OLGA) Staging\" (ECHOS study), propose endoscopic surveillance of advanced GPMC (OLGA/Operative Link for Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia [OLGIM] stages III-IV) with reliable risk stratification to facilitate early GC detection. Ensuring high-quality EGD and enhanced diagnostic yield of GPMC is essential. GPMC grading tools, such as the Kimura-Takemoto or Endoscopic Grading of Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia classification, should be incorporated into the regular risk assessment protocol. However, obtaining mapping gastric biopsies using standardized methods such as the updated Sydney System biopsy protocol, followed by grading of chronic atrophic gastritis with or without intestinal metaplasia using the OLGA and OLGIM staging systems are preferred for GC risk stratification. Recent GC prevention strategies recommended in Chile include a \"test-and-treat\" approach for H. pylori in individuals aged 35-44 years and combined H. pylori/pepsinogen I-II serology and EGD evaluation in patients aged >45 years to optimize the limited preventive resources available in the region.",

In this study, we investigated the association between oral health and gastric cancer in Korean adults using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. METHODS: We analyzed data of 79501 patients with gastric cancer and 41856805 individuals without gastric cancer (control group) using the 7th and 8th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016-2019) records. Layer and colony variables and weights were used for the complex sample design. We performed logistic regression analysis of complex samples to analyze factors that affect gastric cancer development. RESULTS: Patients with gastric cancer were older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes and a higher rate of current smoking and alcohol consumption than individuals without gastric cancer (p<0.001). Regarding oral health-related factors, the prevalence of very uncomfortable chewing difficulty was significantly higher in patients with gastric cancer (14.4% vs. 3.6%, p<0.001). On multivariate analysis of factors associated with gastric cancer, chewing difficulty showed the highest odds ratio (5.351, 95% confidence interval 2.128-8.982). Patients with very uncomfortable chewing difficulty had high rates of previous dental nerve treatment, gum disease treatment, tooth extraction or intraoral surgery, and prosthetic repair (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Oral health-related chewing difficulties were associated with gastric cancer, which may be attributable to poor oral hygiene and degradation of oral microbiota.

We compared 30-day intensive care unit (ICU) admission and all-cause mortality risks in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta and Omicron variants versus influenza A and B (A/B). METHODS: Data from two retrospective inpatient cohorts in Capital Region of Denmark were analyzed. Cohorts included hospitalized influenza A/B patients (2017-2018) and SARS-CoV-2 Delta/Omicron patients (2021-2022), aged \u226518 years, admitted within 14 days of a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test result. Cumulative ICU admission and mortality rates were estimated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. Cox regression models calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for ICU admission and mortality. RESULTS: The study encompassed 1459 inpatients (Delta: 49%; Omicron: 26%; influenza A: 6.4%; and influenza B: 18%). Cumulative incidence of ICU admission was 11%, 4.0%, 7.5%, and 4.1%, for Delta, Omicron, influenza A, and B, respectively. For ICU admission, adjusted HRs (aHRs) were 3.1 (p\u2009<\u2009.001) and 1.5 (p\u2009=\u2009.34) for Delta and Omicron versus influenza B, and 1.5 (p\u2009=\u2009.36) and 0.71 (p\u2009=\u2009.48) versus influenza A. For mortality, aHRs were 3.8 (p\u2009<\u2009.001) and 3.4 (p\u2009<\u2009.001) for Delta and Omicron versus influenza B, and 2.1 (p\u2009=\u2009.04) and 1.9 (p\u2009=\u2009.11) versus influenza A. CONCLUSION: Delta but not Omicron inpatients had an increased risk for ICU admission compared to influenza B; however, both variants were associated with higher risks of mortality than influenza B.

Allergic reactions occur when the immune system overreacts to normally harmless substances, and it is known that regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a major role in immune system suppression and the generation of tolerance. However, new research suggests that Tregs can malfunction in environments that promote allergies. This review delves into Treg function, and how environmental factors can influence their ability to maintain immune homeostasis. Specifically, we explore the origins of Treg cells, as well as the mechanisms used for suppression of inflammation and tissue healing, with a concentration on food allergies, atopic dermatitis and asthma.

However, as tumor development and progression are biological processes involving composite genomic aberrations, key challenges are to effectively assimilate information from these domains to identify genomic signatures and druggable biological entities, develop accurate risk prediction profiles for future patients, and identify novel patient subgroups for tailored therapy and monitoring. We propose integrative frameworks for high-dimensional multiple-domain cancer data. These Bayesian mixture model-based approaches coherently incorporate dependence within and between domains to accurately detect tumor subtypes, thus providing a catalog of genomic aberrations associated with cancer taxonomy. The flexible and scalable Bayesian nonparametric strategy performs simultaneous bidirectional clustering of the tumor samples and genomic probes to achieve dimension reduction. We describe an efficient variable selection procedure that can identify relevant genomic aberrations and potentially reveal underlying drivers of disease. Although the work is motivated by lung cancer datasets, the proposed methods are broadly applicable in a variety of contexts involving high-dimensional data.

To this end, we developed a quantile regression model for survival data in the presence of long-term survivors based on the generalized Gompertz distribution in a defective version, which is conveniently reparametrized in terms of the q-th quantile and then linked to covariates via a logarithm link function. This proposal allows us to obtain how each variable affects the survival times in different quantiles. In addition, we are able to study the effects of covariates on the cure rate as well. We consider Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to develop a Bayesian analysis in the proposed model and we evaluate its performance through Monte Carlo simulation studies.

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), limited resources and inadequate healthcare infrastructures further exacerbate the challenges of breast cancer prevention, treatment, and awareness. METHODS: We examined the prevalence, risk factors, and trends of breast cancer in LMICs. Data on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and breast cancer risk factors were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) databases for 203 countries or territories from 1990 to 2019. LMIC DALY rates were examined using joinpoint regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the income groups, the lower middle-income category had the highest DALYs value, with 1787 years per 100,000 people. LMICs collectively accounted for 74% of the global burden of DALYs lost due to breast cancer in 2019. However, it remained relatively consistent in lower middle income countries (LMCs). In LMCs, the risk associated with metabolic syndromes was higher compared to that with behavioral factors alone. For the past three decades, breast cancer incidences increased significantly in LMCs (average annual percent change [AAPC]: 1.212, confidence intervals [CI]: 1.51-1.87, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), upper middle income countries (AAPC: 1.701, CI: 1.12-1.48, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and low-income countries (AAPC: 1.002, CI: 1.57-1.68, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). CONCLUSION: This research shows how breast cancer in LMICs is aggravated by low resources and healthcare infrastructure.

As a result, the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Patient Survey was established as the first standardized national survey to publicly report patient ratings on hospital care. There remains a lack of research that examines rural-urban distinctions in patient satisfaction. The objective of this study was to investigate if there is a difference in hospital determinants of patient satisfaction among hospitals based on rural status. METHODS: The study utilized two public datasets containing HCAHPS survey results from 4714 US hospitals and from eligible cancer hospitals that participate in the Prospective Payment System-Exempt Cancer Hospital Quality Reporting. The data were collected from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 and published by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Rural status of each hospital was determined by matching zip codes with data provided by the Health Resources & Services Administration. RESULTS: A total of 3248 hospitals were included in the analysis, with approximately 51.14% located in rural areas. There was a significant difference across every hospital determinant when comparing rural and non-rural status. Rural hospitals had a higher score for every hospital determinant (Cleanliness, Nurse communication, Doctor communication, Staff responsiveness, Communication about medicines, Discharge information, Care transition, Overall hospital rating, Quietness, and Willingness to recommend the hospital), indicating better performance. CONCLUSION: Rural hospitals demonstrated better HCAHPS performance across every hospital determinant in comparison to urban hospitals, suggesting possible recent improvements. Future research is necessary to investigate this trend and its consistency, which can inform targeted interventions to better address the healthcare needs of diverse populations in the United States.",

With the availability of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screenings, it is more likely for cervical cancers to be prevented or caught early in their course. However, there are disparities and barriers preventing all individuals from obtaining proper preventative care. METHODS: An online survey analyzing compliance, barriers, and subjective perceptions of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening was distributed via flyers. These were placed in the half of zip codes with lowest median income in Fort Worth, Texas. RESULTS: Respondents with non-White race, income of $40,000 or less, and a maximum education of high school or less were 4.24, 3.2, and 1.2 times more likely to have incomplete HPV vaccination, respectively. Respondents with an income of $40,000 or less and a maximum education of high school were 3.2 and 2.6 times more likely to be overdue for cervical cancer screening, respectively. The most common barrier for HPV vaccination was lack of knowledge, and for cervical cancer screening, it was cost. Most respondents felt as though cervical cancer screening allows for early cancer detection and decreased mortality but also endorsed feelings of pain, embarrassment, and fear of the test. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine and cervical cancer screening non-compliance is likely multifactorial, including lack of knowledge and cost.

Enhancing diagnostics to identify drug-resistant infections and improving appropriate access to novel Reserve antibiotics in LMICs can address AMR-related morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. This article characterizes the AMR landscape across 14 LMICs and describes an introductory pathway for novel Reserve antibiotics. METHODS: This mixed-method study was completed in 14 LMICs in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe through a combination of qualitative interviews with physicians and public health experts (PHEs), and a quantitative survey of physicians, supported by an assessment of secondary materials relating to antibiotic introduction and AMR burden. RESULTS: A total of 54 physicians and 17 PHEs were interviewed, and 209 physicians participated in the survey. Top unmet needs across public and private settings were as follows: access to new antibiotics to better manage drug-resistant infections; affordability; adequate safety profile for prescribed antibiotics. Access to diagnostics and antibiotic susceptibility testing was noted as a barrier, with large tertiary and private centres experiencing better access. Implementation of antibiotic stewardship programmes was variable and limited by insufficient funding, shortage of infectious disease physicians, poor AMR education and lack of restrictions to limit antibiotic use. Antibiotic access varies by sector, centre type, location and strength of individual state procurement systems. In particular, private sector facilities have better access to Reserve products. In most countries, most Reserve antibiotics included in WHO's Essential Medicines List (EML) were not included in national EMLs or not registered in countries. CONCLUSION: This study has helped to identify common barriers and pathways to Reserve antibiotic access, irrespective of the level of preparedness of countries. The data offer insights into possible solutions to improve access and highlight opportunities to strengthen access pathways and expedite access, for example, by identifying priority antibiotics based on national public health need. A six-step introductory pathway for novel Reserve antibiotics is described.",

By outlining specific strategies for addressing cancer in the state, cancer control plans serve a critical role during a public health emergency. This policy analysis aims to understand how states updated their cancer control plan as a response to COVID-19. All plans from 50 states and the District of Columbia were reviewed for language related to \"COVID.\" Among the 51 cancer plans analyzed, 7 plans met the inclusion criteria (Illinois [IL], Iowa [IA], Maine [ME], Nevada [NV], North Carolina [NC], Utah [UT], and Vermont [VT]). These seven plans adapted their cancer control plan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic across three main themes: (1) improving care across the cancer care continuum, from prevention to screening and treatment; (2) improving cancer care service delivery by expanding telehealth, addressing workforce shortages, and investing in public health systems; and (3) achieving population health equity by addressing social determinants of health. Two states only adapted their plans by prioritizing future monitoring and evaluation activities as related to the COVID-19 pandemic (ME and VT). The other five states all took different approaches to improve cancer care by adapting their service delivery and addressing social determinants of health. IL prioritized access to cancer screenings through expanding equity informed telehealth models. IA also prioritized equitable screenings as well as clinical trial participation, by addressing workforce shortages. NV focused on prevention, leveraging telehealth and specifically targeted food security and job loss resulting from the pandemic. NC-directed cancer treatment efforts by addressing workforce shortages. UT integrated telehealth and equity initiatives to combat barriers like food insecurity and social disparities. Continued policy surveillance is needed to ensure that patients receive timely, appropriate cancer care during future public health emergencies.

However, the links between in vitro and in vivo data are poorly understood, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of PROTACs. In this work, 14C-labeled vepdegestrant (ARV-471), which is currently in phase III clinical trials for breast cancer, was synthesized as a model PROTAC to characterize its preclinical ADME properties and simulate its clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) by establishing a physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model. For in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), hepatocyte clearance correlated more closely with in vivo rat PK data than liver microsomal clearance did. PBPK models, which were initially developed and validated in rats, accurately simulate ARV-471's PK across fed and fasted states, with parameters within 1.75-fold of the observed values. Human models, informed by in vitro ADME data, closely mirrored postoral dose plasma profiles at 30 mg. Furthermore, no human-specific metabolites were identified in vitro and the metabolic profile of rats could overlap that of humans.

A cancer hallmarks enrichment analysis was performed for prognostic genes associated with overall survival across 12 types of solid tumors. \"Tissue invasion and metastasis\" was most prominent in cancers of the stomach (P = 2.2 \u00d7 10-11), pancreas (P = 4.2 \u00d7 10-9), bladder (P = 3.3 \u00d7 10-8), and ovaries (P = 0.0007), aligning with their heightened potential to spread. \"Sustained angiogenesis\" was most prominent in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung (P = 2.5 \u00d7 10-7), while \"genome instability\" showed strong enrichment in lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) (P = 1.5 \u00d7 10-8) and cancers of the liver (P = 5.5 \u00d7 10-10), pancreas (P = 2.1 \u00d7 10-5), and kidney (P = 0.018). Pancreatic cancers displayed the highest enrichment of hallmarks, emphasizing the disease's complexity, while in melanomas and cancers of the liver, prostate, and kidney, a single hallmark was enriched among the prognostic markers of survival. Additionally, an online tool (www.cancerhallmarks.com) that allows the identification of cancer-associated hallmarks from new gene sets was established. In summary, our aim of establishing a consensus list of cancer hallmark genes was achieved. Furthermore, the analysis of survival-associated genes revealed a unique pattern of hallmark enrichment with potential pharmacological implications in different tumor types.",

        "AbstractText": "Ferroptosis has been shown to mediate the development of fibrosis. Polyphyllin VII (PP7), a bioactive component of Paris polyphylla, exhibits potent anti-inflammatory activity and can significantly alleviate liver fibrosis. In this study, treatment with PP7 significantly inhibited the proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which could be suppressed by a ferroptosis inhibitor. In addition, it promoted HSC ferroptosis by suppressing glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and enhanced the expression of CX3C chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1). Depletion of CX3CL1 attenuated the effects of PP7 on the activation and ferroptosis of HSCs and the expression of GPX4. Notably, CX3CL1 directly interacted with GPX4, triggering HSC ferroptosis. The transcription factor hypermethylated in cancer 1 (Hic1), which binds to the Cx3cl1 promoter, increased the expression of CX3CL1. Its absence resulted in downregulation of CX3CL1, suppressing the GPX4-dependent ferroptosis of PP7-treated HSCs and promoting their activation. HIC1 was found to directly interact with PP7 at the GLY164 site. Co-culture experiments showed that PP7-induced HSC ferroptosis attenuated macrophage recruitment by regulating inflammation-related genes. HSC-specific inhibition of HIC1 counteracted PP7-induced collagen depletion and HSC ferroptosis in vivo. These findings suggest that PP7 induces HSC ferroptosis through the HIC1/CX3CL1/GPX4 axis.",

        "AbstractText": "The incomplete degradation of tumour cells by macrophages (M\u03d5) is a contributing factor to tumour progression and metastasis, and the degradation function of M\u03d5 is mediated through phagosomes and lysosomes. In our preliminary experiments, we found that overactivation of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) reduced the ability of M\u03d5 to degrade engulfed tumour cells. Above this, we screened out liquiritin from Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch, which can significantly inhibit NOX2 activity and inhibit tumours, to elucidate that suppressing NOX2 can enhance the ability of M\u03d5 to degrade tumour cells. We found that the tumour environment could activate the NOX2 activity in M\u03d5 phagosomes, causing M\u03d5 to produce excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus prohibiting the formation of phagolysosomes before degradation. Conversely, inhibiting NOX2 in M\u03d5 by liquiritin can reduce ROS and promote phagosome-lysosome fusion, therefore improving the enzymatic degradation of tumour cells after phagocytosis, and subsequently promote T cell activity by presenting antigens. We further confirmed that liquiritin down-regulated the expression of the NOX2 specific membrane component protein gp91 phox, blocking its binding to the NOX2 cytoplasmic component proteins p67 phox and p47 phox, thereby inhibiting the activity of NOX2. This study elucidates the specific mechanism by which M\u03d5 cannot degrade tumour cells after phagocytosis, and indicates that liquiritin can promote the ability of M\u03d5 to degrade tumour cells by suppressing NOX2.",

This study investigated the effect of fiber-containing low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (low-FODMAP) formula on the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) complications with tube feeding after HNC surgery. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This retrospective study included 152 tube-fed patients who received nutritional support team care after undergoing surgery for HNC. The differences in nutritional status, nutrition supply, and length of hospital stay were compared according to tube feeding-associated GI complications. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated between Prognostic Nutritional Index, Nutritional Risk Index, a Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002), and Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) as the reference standard. The correlation between changes in the fiber-containing low-FODMAP formula and diarrhea incidence during tube feeding was evaluated. RESULTS: Of 152 patients, 49.3% (n = 75) experienced GI complications during tube feeding. Patients with GI complications were hospitalized for approximately 10 days longer than those without complications. The prevalence rate of GLIM-defined malnutrition was 37.5% at admission. The percentage of patients at risk of developing malnutrition with NRS-2002 score \u2265 3 was 28.3% at admission. The area under the ROC curve of the NRS-2002 score for the GLIM diagnostic criteria for malnutrition was 0.908. The fiber-containing low-FODMAP formula change reduced the stool frequency in patients with diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Our study findings provide essential data for establishing guidelines for selecting suitable formulas for tube-fed patients who have previously experienced diarrhea after HNC surgery.",

An emerging spectrum of human tumors harbors recurrent and pathognomonic gene fusions that involve the transcriptional coactivator YAP1 (which encodes the protein YAP) or its paralog WWTR1 (which encodes the protein TAZ). YAP and TAZ are frequently activated in cancer and are the transcriptional effectors of the Hippo pathway, a highly conserved kinase cascade that regulates diverse functions such as organ size, development, and homeostasis. In this review, we discuss the tumors that have YAP, TAZ, or other Hippo-dysregulating fusion proteins; the mechanisms of these fusion proteins in driving their respective tumors; and the potential vulnerabilities of these chimeric oncoproteins across cancers of many origins. Furthermore, as new YAP1 and WWTR1 gene fusions are discovered, we provide a framework to predict whether the resulting protein product is likely to be oncogenic.",

        "AbstractText": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease that affects the vision of elderly individuals worldwide. Although current therapeutics have shown effectiveness against AMD, some patients may remain unresponsive and continue to experience disease progression. Therefore, in-depth knowledge of the mechanism underlying AMD pathogenesis is urgently required to identify potential drug targets for AMD treatment. Recently, studies have suggested that dysfunction of mitochondria can lead to the aggregation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) innate immunity pathways, ultimately resulting in sterile inflammation and cell death in various cells, such as cardiomyocytes and macrophages. Therefore, combining strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory mediators may hold great potential in facilitating AMD management. Notably, emerging evidence indicates that natural products targeting mitochondrial quality control (MQC) and the cGAS/STING innate immunity pathways exhibit promise in treating AMD. Here, we summarize phytochemicals that could directly or indirectly influence the MQC and the cGAS/STING innate immunity pathways, as well as their interconnected mediators, which have the potential to mitigate oxidative stress and suppress excessive inflammatory responses, thereby hoping to offer new insights into therapeutic interventions for AMD treatment.",

The objective of this study is to review outcomes from the Seattle Children's Hospital (SCH) institutional standard therapy for relapsed medulloblastoma, modified from the published ACNS0821 regimen. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients treated for relapsed medulloblastoma from 2012-2024 treated with modified ACNS0821 therapy, including combination bevacizumab, irinotecan, and temozolomide, referred to as \"TIB.\" Each TIB cycle includes oral temozolomide (200 mg/m2/day) for the first 5 days, intravenous (IV) bevacizumab (10 mg/kg/dose), and IV irinotecan (125 mg/m2/dose or 340 mg/m2) on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. Patient medical history, prior treatment, therapy toxicity, response, and outcome were collected. The analysis included Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year overall survival (OS) and 3-year progression-free survival. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were treated with TIB for relapsed medulloblastoma at SCH (median age 5.81 (0.21-23.6) years, 60% male). Twelve patients completed planned therapy. Therapy was discontinued for toxicity (n\u2005=\u20051) and family preference (n\u2005=\u20051). The most common toxicities were thrombocytopenia (n\u2005=\u20057), neutropenia (n\u2005=\u20054), nausea (n\u2005=\u20055), vomiting (n\u2005=\u20055), and diarrhea (n\u2005=\u20053). Five patients required dose modification of one agent for toxicity. Median follow-up from TIB therapy start was 1.61 (0.47-7.66) years. Three-year OS was 48% (95% CI: 18%-74%) and 3-year event-free survival was 16% (95% CI: 1%-49%). CONCLUSIONS: TIB was well-tolerated in pediatric patients with relapsed medulloblastoma, and outcomes were similar to those published in clinical trials.

To ensure equitable palliative care, understanding the place of death is crucial, as disparities may lead to inequity of care. This study aims to identify the place of death in adults with malignant brain tumors in Sweden, and the potential associations with official palliative care status by the ICD-10 code Z51.5, sociodemographic factors, health service characteristics, and healthcare service utilization. METHODS: A population-level registry study examined the place of death among adults who died of malignant brain tumors in Sweden from 2013 to 2019. Descriptive statistics, univariable, and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: We identified 3,888 adults who died from malignant brain tumors. Of these, 64.4% did not receive an official palliative care status. Specialized palliative care was not utilized in 57.2% at the place of death and in 80% of nursing home deaths. In the last month of life, 53.5% of hospital deaths involved 1 transfer, while 41.8% had 2 or more transfers. The odds ratio (OR) of dying in hospital versus at home was higher, with 2 or more transfers (OR 0.63 [0.40, 0.99]). The OR of dying in a hospital versus at home showed significant regional differences. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the severity of their diagnosis, only a minority of patients utilized specialized palliative services at death, and this varied by the place of death. Significant regional disparities were found between hospital and home deaths, indicating unequal end-of-life palliative care in this patient group.",

Most patients achieve complete symptom resolution without long-term neurological sequelae, yet the impact of ICANS and steroid therapy on oncological outcomes remains inadequately explored. We investigated the association between ICANS and steroid therapy with progression-free survival (PFS). METHODS: We included large B-cell lymphoma patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells. The primary outcome was 90-day PFS. The secondary outcomes included PFS, complete response, and overall survival (OS) at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days. The association between outcomes and ICANS and steroid treatment was assessed using logistic regression analyses adjusted for baseline factors. RESULTS: Overall, 241 patients were included. The median age was 60 years (interquartile range [IQR]\u2005=\u200551-66), 81 (33.6%) were females, 67 (27.8%) developed ICANS, and 142 (58.9%) achieved 90-day PFS. There was no association between 90-day PFS and ICANS development (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.39 [95% confidence interval {CI}\u2005=\u20050.75-2.61]), maximum grade (aOR 1.24 [0.97-1.59]), duration (aOR 1.00 [95% CI\u2005=\u20050.95-1.05] per 1-day increase), or day of onset (aOR 0.98 [95% CI\u2005=\u20050.86-1.11] per 1-day increase). There was no association between 90-day PFS and steroid therapy (aOR 1.25 [95% CI\u2005=\u20050.73-2.14]) or cumulative dose (aOR 1.00 [95% CI\u2005=\u20050.98-1.01] per 100-mg increase).

The aim of this study was to extract risk factors for Type I LM and to clarify the optimal treatment for BMs from the perspective of Type I LM prevention. METHODS: The clinical course of consecutive cases of BMs derived from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated at our hospital was retrospectively evaluated. The relationship between clinicopathological factors, including molecular background, and Type I LM development was verified. In addition, the difference in the time to Type I LM because of treatment for BMs was evaluated to clarify the effectiveness of each treatment in preventing Type I LM. RESULTS: Of 784 patients with BMs, 44 exhibited Type I LM at the onset of BMs. Poor performance status (P\u2005<\u2005.0001) and mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene (P\u2005=\u2005.004) were significant risk factors for Type I LM.

OBJECTIVES: This study applied the equity and sustainability-informed RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) to gain insights into clinical informatics interventions for collection and use of PROs across health systems. METHODS: A total of 14 health informatics and clinical professionals were interviewed about the development and use of PROs within their health systems and individual practices. Directed content analysis was performed to highlight patterns, similarities, and differences in stakeholder perspectives across RE-AIM domains. RESULTS: The reach of clinical informatics interventions using PROs varied across clinical practices and settings based upon institutional commitment and support, integration of clinical information systems, and engagement with patients and families. Although interventions using PROs were viewed as effective for enabling focused conversations with patients and facilitating shared decision-making, barriers to adoption included licensing requirements associated with PRO instruments, lack of incentives for their use, limited integration of PRO results into electronic medical record systems, and poor support for patients with low technology and/or health literacy. Implementation of interventions using PROs was facilitated through training and support staff who aided clinicians with clinical workflow integration, availability of questionnaires in multiple languages, identifying thresholds and strategies for action, and presenting interpretable visualizations showing changes over time alongside significant clinical events. Maintenance of interventions using PROs was enabled through multimodal data collection approaches and data governance groups that evaluated organizational requests to track new measures. CONCLUSION: Initiatives to increase the reach of clinical informatics interventions using PROs will require health system investments into medical record system integration, education, and implementation support for clinicians and patients, and efforts to reach patient populations with language barriers or limited technology literacy.",

However, the application of conventional nanoparticles is limited by the inability to escape from endo-lysosomes. Herein, we report a strategy using small-molecule drugs to enhance siRNA endo-lysosomal release,addressing this challenge. We encapsulated gentamicin(GM) into the marketed Onpattro\u00ae formulation to establish LNP-siRNA/GM nanoparticles that promote siRNA endo-lysosomal escape through endosomal disruption, mechanistically exhibiting unique functionality and synergistic effects of LNP-siRNA/GM to improve cancer therapy. Besides, GM induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phospholipids accumulation in endo-lysosomes, as well as the physical characteristics of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were preserved. We also revealed that GM causes endo-lysosomal swelling and disrupts the endosomal membrane to enable siRNA release, as confirmed by Galectin 3 recruitment and acridine orange release. This approach achieved \u223c81% mRNA-EGFR silencing, which is more than LNP-siEGFR (\u223c56.23%) by enhancing siRNA endo-lysosomal escape efficiency. Meanwhile, LNP-siEGFR/GM exhibited significant biological activities in HepG2 cells, driven by the synergistic effects of siEGFR and GM with the VEGF and CXCL12 downregulation of, and ROS and phospholipids upregulation. Furthermore, tumor growth was notably suppressed after intravenous injection of LNP-siEGFR/GM in tumor-bearing nude mice. The combination of EGFR-siRNA and GM could also greatly inhibit angiogenesis, be antiproliferative, and induce tumor cells apoptosis. Therefore, this GM and siRNA co-delivery system would provide an efficient strategy for siRNA endosomal escape, significantly improving knockdown in various LNPs based siRNA delivery systems and efficiently enhancing cancer therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shows the highest morbidity among liver cancers and is a major contributor to cancer-associated mortality. It is characterized by genetic mutations in hepatocytes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Current treatment include surgery, chemotherapy and immunotherapy; however, chemotherapeutics, which focus on single-targeted drug therapy, are still associated with certain limitations and may affect the treatment outcomes. Compared with chemotherapy drugs, natural products also show the anticancer effect of HCC and hypotoxicity, but overall low activity of natural products limits their further application. MmiRNAs can modulate post-transcriptional functions of target genes. An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs are the key regulators in HCC by targeting different molecules in different signaling pathways. However, miRNAs are fragile and liable to catabolism by RNases in serum and other body fluids and small molecules separated from natural products may have limited bio-availability. According to this background, a chitosan based, targeted sustained-release nanoparticle delivery miR-128-3p agomir (NA-miR-128-3p) was developed in this work. This nanoparticle was prepared by pentasodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), chitosan hydrochloride, and miR-128-3p agomir with target aptamer which was loaded into the chitosan nanoparticle by self-assembly. It can intervene in HCC progress by affecting AKT1 expression. Based on this, a novel, efficient, long-acting, multi-mechanism, low-dosage combination drug delivery strategy was proposed in this work and showed a prominent anti-tumor effect. NA-miR-128-3p combined with natural product Oroxin B significantly affected HCC progression by the interference with VEGF and PI3K-AKT pathways, better than using NA-miR-128-3p and Oroxin B alone. Taken together, this nanoparticle and combinative administration compensate for the shortcomings of the fragile RNA drugs and the low activity of natural products, with high prospects in HCC treatment.",

There is a gap in our knowledge of underlying metabolic, biochemical, and electrophysiological mechanisms behind several neurological processes at a cellular level, which can be traced to the lack of versatile and high-throughput tools to investigate neural networks. In this paper, four label-free contrasts were explored as mechanisms to study neuronal activity, namely, scattering, birefringence, autofluorescence from metabolic cofactors and molecules, and local biochemistry. To overcome challenges of observing neuronal activity spanning three orders of magnitude in space and time, microscopes had to be developed to simultaneously capture these contrasts quickly, with high resolution, and over a large FOV. We developed versatile autofluorescence lifetime, multiharmonic generation, polarization-sensitive interferometry, and Raman imaging in epi-detection (VAMPIRE) microscopy to simultaneously observe multiple facets of neuronal structure and dynamics. The accelerated computational-imaging-driven acquisition speeds, the utilization of a single light source to evoke all contrasts, the simultaneous acquisition that provides an otherwise impossible multimodal dynamic imaging capability, and the real-time processing of the data enable VAMPIRE microscopy as a powerful imaging platform for neurophotonics and beyond.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: There is a growing body of evidence that ultraviolet (UV) tanning, whether practiced in indoor tanning salons or outdoors in the sun, is not only linked to detrimental health outcomes but is also addictive through both psychological and physiological mechanisms. In clinical practice, it can be challenging to determine which patients will continue tanning despite being at high risk for developing skin cancer. Our study seeks to identify all available screening questionnaires for tanning addiction that could be used in clinical practice and report on published measures of validity for each screening questionnaire. METHODS: An exhaustive literature search of EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus was performed using search criteria including the concepts \"UV\" and \"Addiction.\" The most recent search was performed in March 2024 and included all articles from database inception to the time of the search. Studies were included if they reported on screening questionnaires for UV addiction. Articles were excluded from the study if they did not report primary data or did not report on measures of questionnaire validity. Methodology was created using best practices for scoping reviews. RESULTS: After identifying 171 articles, 106 articles underwent full-text review, and 26 were included in data extraction. We identified nine questionnaires for tanning addiction, with the modified Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener (mCAGE), and modified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (mDSM) being most frequently reported on, and the Behavioral Addiction Indoor Tanning Screener (BAITS) being the most promising for future use. CONCLUSIONS: This information should be used to choose questionnaires to be studied against a \"gold-standard\" of a panel of psychologists. After defining accuracy of diagnostic tests, studies can be designed to examine interventions for treating tanning addiction, so at-risk patients can receive specialized therapy, reducing the overall burden of skin cancers.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The incidence of depression in adolescents is increasing and is associated with severe cognitive impairment. This paper aimed to investigate the relationship between polymorphisms in microRNA-146a-5p (miR-146a-5p) and cognitive impairment in adolescent depression patients. METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify miR-146a-5p in serum. Detection of miR-146a-5p gene polymorphism was performed by TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by chi-square test (\u03c72) and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Genotyping of miR-146a rs2910164 showed that CC (OR = 0.443, 95% CI, 0.264-0.741, p = 0.002) and GC (OR = 0.445, 95% CI, 0.279-0.712, p = 0.001) genotype reduced the risk of cognitive impairment in adolescent depression. The C allele (OR = 0.794, 95% CI, 0.694-0.741, p = 0.001) was a protective factor for cognitive impairment in adolescent depression compared to the rs2910164 G allele. Rs2910164 (OR = 0.425, 95% CI = 0.273-0.662, p = 0.000) showed a negative correlation with adolescents with cognitive impairment in depression by logistic regression analysis. The level of miR-146a-5p was decreased in carriers of the CC and CG genotypes. CONCLUSION: Rs2910164 C allele carriers have a low risk of cognitive impairment in adolescent depression and could reduce miR-146a-5p level.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Addressing the mental health needs of patients with cancer and their families during survivorship.",
        "AbstractText": "Diagnosis with cancer can be a shocking, life-altering, and traumatic experience for both the affected patient and their family, which may include immediate or extended family, significant others, and caregivers. Living with or surviving cancer can negatively impact the patient and their family members individually, and it can also result in negative effects on the patient-family dyad. In the US alone, the American Cancer Society anticipates approximately 2 million new cases of cancer in 2024; moreover, as many as 25% to 30% of cancer survivors experience anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Although healthcare providers are often pressed for time during routine initial and follow-up appointments, exploration of the person with cancer's journey through the disease course must be a priority and a collaborative effort. Prompt identification of mental health disorders, including substance use disorders, in people with cancer and their family members is essential to the well-being of the dyad. Many primary care providers provide both primary care services and survivorship care, such as posttreatment preexisting and secondary cancer surveillance, to cancer survivors. Primary care NPs are therefore well positioned to screen, assess, and treat mental health conditions in the cancer survivor and their family. The primary care NP also may have a greater opportunity to interface with patients' family members, thereby promoting healthier families and societies.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is a significant global health concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to preventive healthcare. India's vast rural population amplifies the challenge, demanding immediate action. Despite advancements, cervical cancer remains prevalent among underserved rural communities, hindered by barriers to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screening uptake, including socioeconomic and financial constraints. This study aims to evaluate the economic challenges encountered by rural women when accessing HPV screening. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1502 women aged 30 to 45 in Pondicherry, India, utilizing the Andersen Model as a conceptual framework. Household questionnaires gathered data on HPV screening expenses, including patient travel costs, productivity loss, and companion costs. The analysis utilized regression models, to identify the factors impacting the economic challenges associated with accessing HPV screening. RESULTS: The study found that employment status significantly influenced healthcare costs, with employed women incurring \u20b965.78 more than unemployed women (p < 0.001). Education level was also a significant predictor, with each additional year of education leading to a \u20b9108.45 increase in costs (p < 0.001). Travel time had a positive association with healthcare costs, with every additional minute spent traveling increasing costs by \u20b95.98 (p < 0.001). Income and companion accompaniment were also significant predictors, while distance to the PHC and age did not show significant associations with total healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the multifaceted economic challenges faced by rural populations accessing HPV screening for cervical cancer prevention in India. Notwithstanding diverse demographics and varying proximity to healthcare facilities, individuals encounter significant barriers such as travel time and associated costs. Addressing these challenges necessitates targeted interventions to reduce socioeconomic disparities and improve healthcare accessibility for vulnerable populations, thereby advancing cervical cancer prevention efforts and promoting health equity in rural communities.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 2-[18F]FDG (FDG) has been increasingly used to detect or monitor neoplasms. Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is one of the most common sites of FDG uptake, leading to increasing requests for endoscopic examinations. We aimed to evaluate the nature and significance of unexpected PET/CT-FDG findings in the GIT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 371 consecutive patients with incidental GIT findings on PET/CT-FDG between June 2016 and October 2021 who were subsequently referred to endoscopic examinations. Demographic data, PET/CT-FDG results, endoscopic findings, and histological analysis were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 194 colonic incidental uptakes, 102 (52.6%) corresponded to at least premalignant lesions, being 57 (29.4%) advanced adenomas and 23 (11.9%) adenocarcinomas. Of 193 upper GIT incidental uptakes, there were 11 (13.8%) esophageal and 14 (14.4%) gastric malignant/premalignant lesions. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) significantly varied according to the nature of the lesion, being higher in malignant lesions (in the esophagus, stomach, and colon). However, an optimal SUVmax cutoff was only found for stomach (SUVmax 8.2; sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 76%). There was a significant association between the site of uptake and the nature of the lesion - left colon and gastric body uptake were associated with neoplastic origin whereas rectum and lower esophagus were associated with inflammatory or no endoscopic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Any incidental uptake in the lower GIT should be investigated provided that patients are suitable for further treatment. However, in the upper GIT the characteristics of uptake on 18F-FDG-PET/CT may allow to select those who need endoscopic examination.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Born in Bradford (BiB) is a family cohort study with linked routine health records. We calculated the rates of common health conditions and explored differences between White European and South Asian participants. METHODS: 21 health conditions were identified using diagnostic codes and prescription records extracted from electronic health records. We calculated 2-year period prevalence before recruitment and incidence rates per 1000 person-years were calculated from recruitment to the end of 2021 (or censoring). Age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios (HR) by ethnicity. RESULTS: The sample included 9,784 mothers, 52% were of South Asian heritage and 48% were White European. The highest prevalence and incidence rates were observed for common mental health disorders and eczema. South Asian women had higher incidence of 14 conditions, including diabetes (HR 3.94 [95% CI 3.15, 4.94]), chronic liver disease (2.98 [2.29, 3.88]) and thyroid disorders (1.87 [1.50, 2.33]), but lower incidence of cancer (0.51 [0.38, 0.68]), other and common mental health disorders (0.56 [0.45, 0.71] and 0.69 [0.64, 0.74] respectively), and other neuromuscular conditions (0.63 [0.49, 0.82]). CONCLUSIONS/DISCUSSION: This study reveals significant differences in the occurrence of several non-communicable health conditions between White European and South Asian women. The observed higher incidence of several conditions in South Asian women, consistent with established knowledge regarding elevated risks for diseases such as diabetes, likely reflects the complex interplay of social, cultural, lifestyle, environmental, and genetic determinants. These findings emphasise the need for culturally sensitive and targeted public health interventions aimed at addressing modifiable risk factors at both the individual and systemic levels to alleviate the burden of long-term health conditions and reduce existing health inequalities.",

The aim of this narrative review is to categorize the adverse effects of ALA relevant to anesthesia providers. Intraoperative hypotension, porphyria-related side effects, alterations in blood chemistry and coagulation, photosensitivity, and increased levels of liver enzymes have all been reported. We also sought to examine the impact of dosage and timing of oral administration on efficacy of ALA and on these side effects. Twenty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria of patients undergoing craniotomy for glioma resection using ALA and occurrence of at least one adverse effect. The results of these studies showed that there was heterogeneity in levels of intraoperative hypotension, with some reporting an incidence as high as 32%, and that hypotension was associated with antihypertensive medication use. Clinical symptoms of porphyria, such as gastrointestinal disturbance, were less commonly reported. Photosensitivity of the skin after 5-ALA administration was well documented particularly in patients exposed to light; however, adverse effects on the eye were not adequately studied. Elevation in liver enzymes was a common finding postoperatively but was often clinically insignificant. The timing of oral administration presents practical issues for the preoperative management of patients undergoing resection with ALA. We provide guidance for perioperative management of patients who receive ALA for brain tumor resection. Controlled studies with adequate statistical power are required to further understand and prevent the adverse effects of ALA.",

DESIGN: Secondary data were used in a retrospective, observational study. SETTING: The setting was a National Cancer Institute (NCI) hospital in Richmond, Virginia. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-93 years of age (51.6% female and 48.4% identifying as male) with 6 cancer diagnoses (breast, blood/hematologic, colorectal/gastrointestinal, gynecologic, lung/respiratory, and prostate/genitourinary) admitted to an NCI over 5 years were included for analysis. There were 1949 patients included for analysis in a paired t test, and 448 patients analyzed in an adjusted linear regression based upon complete case analysis. INTERVENTION: The study analyzed the receipt and intensity of OT services. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) 6-Clicks Basic Mobility scores were analyzed at the time of admission to therapy services and prior to discharge. RESULTS: The patients' final recorded AM-PAC 6-Clicks Basic Mobility score was statistically significantly higher than the first session's AM-PAC 6-Clicks Basic Mobility score as determined by a paired t test analysis. In a multiple linear regression model adjusted for patient social and demographic factors, we found that for every additional OT service provided, there was an increase in the AM-PAC 6-Clicks Basic Mobility change score; the difference, however, was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: There was a statistically significant increase in functional mobility independence for patients with cancer who received OT services in an unadjusted analysis and a non-significant increase in an adjusted analysis of patients' functional mobility. Findings suggest OT services for patients with cancer may influence functional mobility independence.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Palliative care has been shown to be effective for patients with advanced cancer; however, the best approach to deliver palliative care needs to be considered. We hypothesized that a combination of palliative care via video telemedicine (TMD) and usual outpatient treatment would improve patients' quality of life (QOL) and ameliorate depression and prognosis. METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer who terminated treatment with chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients who could perform videoconferencing were assigned to the TMD group and those who could not perform were assigned to the (no TMD; control) group. The primary endpoint was QOL, which was evaluated using the difference in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scores between baseline and one-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints included depression, measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, overall survival, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included in this study (25 in each group). A comparison of measures of QOL at one month showed that the TMD group maintained a better QOL. FACT-G decreased by 0.21 and 5.96 points in the TMD and no TMD groups, respectively (p = 0.047). The TMD group maintained better QOL. There were trends suggesting improvements in depression and survival which did not reach significance. CES-D increased by 0.92 and 3.50 points in the TMD and no TMD groups, respectively (p = 0.26). Median survival time was 7.82 (3.30-14.59) and 6.37 (2.33-11.04) months in the TMD and no TMD groups, respectively. The results of the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire suggest that video TMD could be a feasible tool in palliative care. CONCLUSION: Video TMD is effective in maintaining the QOL of patients with advanced cancer and is feasible based on patient satisfaction. It is desirable to further evaluate the usefulness of palliative care using video TMD and evaluate its clinical applications.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy (RT) is central to the management of unresectable stage I to III NSCLC. However, the impact of actionable genetic driver alterations (AGAs) on locoregional control (LRC) from RT remains uncertain. A retrospective, multicenter real-world study was undertaken to determine if common AGAs impact LRC after RT. METHODS: Patients who received curative-intent RT for NSCLC between 2018 and 2020 at four centers in the United Kingdom and had available molecular testing were included. Locoregional control was compared in a 1:2 ratio between a group of patients with an AGA and a control group without AGAs. Locoregional control was assessed with competing risks analysis and overall survival was analyzed by Cox regression, adjusting for established prognostic clinical factors. RESULTS: Data was collected for 185 eligible patients: 50 with an AGA and 135 without. Baseline characteristics, including patient demographics, tumor features, and treatment details were evenly distributed between the two groups. LRC was similar in the AGA and non-AGA groups (39% versus 34%, hazard ratio\u00a0= 1.13, 95% confidence interval: 0.61-1.984, p\u00a0= 0.84). Actionable genetic driver alterations were not associated with LRC according to multivariable regression analysis. Median overall survival was significantly higher in the AGA group (45 mo versus 26 mo, hazard ratio\u00a0= 0.64, 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.96, p\u00a0= 0.044), and all these patients received targeted therapies on relapse. CONCLUSION: LRC was comparable in the AGA and non-AGA groups suggesting that there is no role for personalization of RT dose solely due to the detection of an AGA. Nevertheless, survival rates were notably higher among patients with AGAs, likely owing to the availability of efficacious targeted therapies on relapse.",

        "AbstractText": "With the rapid advancement of digital and microsurgical techniques, immediate autologous bone grafting following resection of benign and malignant mandibular tumors has become a standard treatment. However, some patients are unable to undergo immediate autologous bone grafting due to various reasons. In such cases, titanium plate implantation (or combined with soft tissue free flap such as anterolateral thigh flap) serves as an alternative to prevent airway compression and maintain facial shape and function. This article reports a case of a patient, referred to as patient 1, who experienced a recurrence of mandibular leiomyosarcoma and was unable to undergo immediate autologous bone grafting. Instead, an immediate titanium plate implantation was chosen to restore the patient's facial contour and esthetics. Although this method addresses functional and esthetic issues in the short term, a high risk of titanium plate exposure, which is shown in patient 2, adversely affects life quality. After systematic evaluation, the decision was made to retain and continue using the original titanium plate and screws and perform autologous fibula flap transplantation to repair the mandibular defect. Surgical procedures included titanium plate removal and debridement, bilateral partial mandibular resection and osteoplasty, preparation of the free fibula flap, and placement with fixation using the original titanium plate. Postoperative follow-up showed successful flap healing without complications, and the patient was satisfied with her postoperative appearance. This innovative strategy, under strict indications, can reduce the financial burden on patients, maintain occlusal relationships, and significantly improve postoperative quality of life.",

Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved products and evidence-based methods exist for smoking cessation, people who smoke might use E-cigarettes as cessation aids. Whether E-cigarette use is associated with the use of evidence-based methods is unknown, particularly among American Indian/Alaska Native individuals. METHODS: Using survey data collected in 2016 from 289 adult American Indian people who smoke and who reported a previous cessation attempt, the authors conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess the associations between E-cigarette use and evidence-based cessation methods. Analyses were performed in 2023. RESULTS: Individuals who currently or formerly used E-cigarettes were significantly more likely to report using nicotine replacement therapy during their last quit attempt than those who did not use E-cigarettes (current versus never AOR=4.6, 95% CI=1.9, 11.9; past versus never AOR=4.6, 95% CI=2.2, 9.8; p<0.001). Current and former E-cigarette use was significantly associated with prescription use in the unadjusted analysis but lost significance in the adjusted analysis (current versus never AOR=3.1, 95% CI=1.0, 10.5; past versus never AOR=2.7, 95% CI=1.1, 7.9; p>0.05). Individuals with current or former use of E-cigarettes were significantly less likely than individuals who never used E-cigarettes to use the cold turkey method (unassisted cessation) (current versus never AOR=0.3, 95% CI=0.2, 0.6; past versus never AOR=0.3, 95% CI=0.1, 0.7; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that persons who use E-cigarettes are more likely than individuals who do not use E-cigarettes to previously have tried nicotine replacement therapy but less likely to use the cold turkey method. A larger study is needed to determine whether individuals who use E-cigarettes are also more likely to have tried prescription medication for smoking cessation. Whether E-cigarette use impedes or encourages the use of evidence-based cessation methods is unknown.",

The basal subtype demonstrates favorable sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemotherapy across multiple classification systems, whereas the luminal infiltrated subtype exhibits potential susceptibility to immunotherapy. In terms of targeted therapy, the basal-like and the basal/squamous subtypes in some classifications have shown notable responsiveness to epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy. Moreover, the luminal subtype in the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center classification, the luminal papillary subtypes according to the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network classification in 2017, and the luminal unstable type in the 2019 Molecular Subtyping classification show potential for the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3-targeted treatment. CONCLUSION: The significance and impact of BCa molecular subtyping in guiding treatment, evaluating progression, and predicting prognosis are increasingly acknowledged. Accurate subtyping and broad application can bring good benefits to clinical decision-making, risk assessment, and prognostic evaluation.",

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To report our preliminary clinical experience and outcomes of uro-oncology procedures conducted utilizing the SSI Mantra\u2122 surgical robotic system. METHODS: Data of consecutive patients who underwent various robot-assisted uro-oncology procedures using the SSI Mantra\u2122 surgical robotic system at our institution between July 2022 and September 2023 were recorded. The specific surgical configurations employed with the SSI Mantra\u2122 for these procedures were duly noted. We assessed the feasibility of these procedures with this novel surgical robotic system and report the outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were operated with the SSI Mantra\u2122 surgical robotic system. The spectrum of procedures performed comprised robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with bilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection (n=77), robot-assisted radical cystectomy with bilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection with extracorporeal urinary diversion (n=39), robot-assisted radical nephrectomy (n=32), robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (n=6), robot-assisted radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision (n=1), and bilateral robot-assisted video endoscopic inguinal lymph node dissection (n=1). One robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy had to be converted to open in view of system malfunction. However, no system-related intraoperative complications or injuries were encountered. CONCLUSION: The SSI Mantra\u2122 surgical robotic system demonstrates significant promise as an innovative robotic platform. In this single-center experience, we have demonstrated the feasibility of a diverse array of surgical procedures using this platform. Further research, involving a larger cohort of patients, is imperative to refine the operative techniques and comprehensively understand the perioperative outcomes of the SSI Mantra\u2122 surgical robotic system, particularly in comparison to other robotic surgical platforms.",

        "AbstractText": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process that involves the transformation of epithelial cells into cells with a mesenchymal phenotype, enhancing their migratory and invasive capabilities. EMT is crucial in embryonic development, tissue healing, and wound repair, and aids in forming diverse cell types and structures. However, aberrant EMT is involved in pathogenic processes, including fibrosis, cancer development, and progression. Recent studies show that EMT contributes to resistance to cancer treatment, including epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This review discusses the intricate relationship between EMT and acquired chemoresistance to EGFR-TKIs. It details evidence on how EGFR-TKIs might induce EMT and how EMT may cause EGFR-TKI resistance. Understanding these pathways is crucial for developing effective prognostic and therapeutic strategies to predict and combat acquired chemoresistance in NSCLC, advancing the field toward more targeted and personalized treatment approaches.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Tryptophan metabolism is involved in esophageal carcinogenesis. However, its genetic mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of genetic variants that encode tryptophan metabolism on susceptibility to esophageal cancer (EC) and elucidate the mechanisms underlying genetic variation in EC progression. METHODS: Age- and sex-matched cohorts of 167 patients with EC and 236 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The concentrations of tryptophan and its metabolites were determined by self-assembled high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. High-throughput sequencing techniques were utilized to detect candidate coding genetic variants, and dominant genetic models were used to elucidate the genotypic associations. RESULTS: Tryptophan metabolism was significantly imbalanced in patients with EC, with elevated indolepropionic acid (IPA) levels reducing the risk of EC susceptibility. ACSM2B rs73530508 (A\u00a0>\u00a0G) mutation was associated with higher IPA levels in vivo (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0004, false discovery rate [FDR]\u00a0=\u00a00.0092) and significantly reduced the risk of EC susceptibility (odds ratio [OR]: 0.576, P adj\u00a0=\u00a00.0161). Mediation effect analysis indicated that single-nucleotide polymorphism may inhibit carcinogenesis by reducing IPA metabolism and excretion with a mediation effect of 45.54%. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies the potential mechanism of ACSM2B rs73530508 (A\u00a0>\u00a0G) in esophageal carcinogenesis and its role in driving increased IPA levels, thereby suppressing the risk of development.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is a common malignancy characterized by the absence of reliable prognostic indicators and effective therapeutic targets. Claudin-9 (CLDN9) has been demonstrated to be upregulated in various cancers. However, its prognostic value, biological function, and regulatory mechanisms in GC remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the role of CLDN9 in GC progression and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We utilized consensus cluster, random survival forest, and multivariate Cox regression analyses to identify CLDN9 in GC. Subsequently, we evaluated the mRNA and protein levels of CLDN9 in GC using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR), Western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, the role of CLDN9 in GC progression was investigated using a series of functional in vivo and in vitro experiments. Finally, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms of CLDN9 using bioinformatics, molecular biology, animal models, and patient tissue specimens. RESULTS: Two GC subtypes with survival and functional differences were identified based on glycolytic metabolic genes in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)- Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) dataset. A prognostic risk score was calculated using seven genes to assess the overall survival (OS) in GC. Using random survival forest and multivariate Cox analyses, we identified CLDN9 as the key gene linked to the glycolytic subtype and prognosis of GC. CLDN9 expression was significantly upregulated in patients with GC as well as in GC cells. CLDN9 knockdown inhibited tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, CLDN9 was found to regulate lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression and promote glycolytic metabolism by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1\u03b1) signaling pathway. Additionally, lactate, a glycolytic metabolite, enhanced programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) lactylation and stability, which suppressed anti-tumor immunity in CD8+ T cells, thereby contributing to GC progression. CONCLUSIONS: CLDN9 expression is associated with GC development and progression. Mechanistically, CLDN9 enhances the glycolysis pathway and facilitates PD-L1 lactylation through the PI3K/AKT/HIF1\u03b1 signaling pathway, thereby suppressing anti-tumor immunity in CD8+ T cells. CLDN9 has the potential to serve as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for GC.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Targeting cuproptosis for cancer therapy: Focus on the anti-tumor immune system.",
        "AbstractText": "Copper (Cu) is an indispensable micronutrient that maintains signaling pathways and biological homeostasis in almost all cell types; however, its excess affects the tricarboxylic acid cycle, causes the accumulation of fatty acylated proteins, destabilization of iron-sulfur cluster proteins, and increases the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, leading to proteotoxic stress and cell death. Cuproptosis, a form of Cu-dependent cell death, differs from other types of regulated cell death (RCD) and was first reported in Science in 2022. Recently, the RCD pathways have been targeted in cancer therapy. However, the escape of apoptosis in tumor cells causes resistance to treatment and tumor recurrence. Therefore, there is an urgent need to study the alternative mechanisms of cancer cell mortality. Compared to normal patients, a significant increase in serum Cu ion levels has been observed in patients with tumors. Moreover, tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis are associated with cuproptosis. Thus, exploring cancer signaling pathways related to cuproptosis will provide a new perspective for the development of anti-cancer drugs. Importantly, cuproptosis is closely associated with the modulation of anti-tumor immunity. The expression of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) is significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration and the immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Based on these findings, a series of cuproptosis-related drugs have been used in tumor-targeted combination therapy or as immune synergists. Therefore, elucidating the role of cuproptosis per cancer stage and in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is helpful in clarifying the potential value of Cu in the treatment of specific cancers. In this review, we summarize specific cancer signaling pathways related to cuproptosis and cancer treatment based on the regulation of Cu concentration. The combination of these two approaches may help researchers develop more therapies targeting cuproptosis-related pathways. Importantly, we focused on the effect of cuproptosis on the TIME and systematically discussed the role of CRGs in tumor immunity considering CRG-related anti-tumor immune signaling pathways, tumor prognosis scoring system, anti-tumor immunotherapy, and biological experiments and bioinformatics prediction models, to provide new ideas for the development of anticancer therapy targeting cuproptosis-related pathways.",

        "AbstractText": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a fatal disease with increasing incidences worldwide. The overall 5-year survival rate remains low, underscoring the urgent need for effective therapies. Despite the promising efficacy of immunotherapy for various solid tumors, its benefits for pancreatic cancer have been disappointing. This is largely because of the complex and unique mechanisms of immune evasion inherent in PDAC. Emerging evidence has highlighted the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in facilitating the immune escape of PDAC. TAMs significantly contribute to forming an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which hinders the effectiveness of immunotherapeutic approaches. They achieve this through multiple pathways, including the secretion of cytokines and the promotion or inhibition of multiple immune cells. In this review, we summarized the main pathways through which TAMs form an immunosuppressive microenvironment in PDAC. We also examined the current status and recent progress of immunotherapy strategies that specifically target macrophages. By understanding these mechanisms and exploring targeted therapies, we aimed to shed light on potential avenues for improving the treatment outcomes of this devastating disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer (BC) continues to be the primary malignant neoplasm affecting women. For many years, traditional approaches such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation, and surgical interventions have been employed to treat BC. However, these therapies often fall short due to considerable adverse effects and the development of multidrug resistance or tolerance. Spices and culinary herbs that have been utilized in culinary practices for millennia have also demonstrated therapeutic effects in traditional medicinal practices serving to both prevent and treat BC. This review aims to comprehensively explore the roles and underlying mechanisms through which spices and culinary herbs exert anti-BC properties. These natural ingredients exhibit diverse anti-BC effects that encompass diverse mechanisms, including the inhibition of BC cell proliferation, migration, metastasis, and angiogenesis, as well as the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These actions are achieved by targeting signaling pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), notch signaling, Hedgehog signaling, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), and Wingless/int (Wnt)/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways that are predominantly overexpressed in breast tumors or are exploited by them to promote cancer progression. Additionally, compounds such as curcumin, allicin, gingerol, zerumbone, diosgenin, capsaicin, piperine, quercetin, malabaricone C, eugenol, cardamomin, carnosol, cinnamaldehyde, sinigrin present in these spices and herbs may be more effective with reduced side effects against BC compared to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs.

Objective This study is to compare the ultrasound with computed tomography in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. Method This was an observational prospective study conducted from October 2020 to April 2023 in patients with or suspected lung cancer sent for imaging assessment to the Department of Radiology and Imaging. Out of 306 patients who underwent computed tomography scan, a total of 234 patients with proven lung cancer were subjected to ultrasound of the chest, liver, bilateral adrenal, and supraclavicular regions for the evaluation of lung mass, pleural effusion, and metastasis in lung, adrenal, and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Diagnostic values of ultrasound to detect peripheral lung lesions, chest wall invasion, pleural effusion, liver and adrenal metastasis, and supraclavicular lymph nodes were compared with contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans. Ultrasound's performance was evaluated against computed tomography scans as the gold standard, using the chi-square test, z-test, and area under the curve for comparison (p < 0.05 for significance). Result The majority of patients (53.8%, n=126) were aged 61-75, with 53% being male and 89% smokers.

        "AbstractText": "In nutritional epidemiology, self-reported dietary data are commonly used to investigate diet-disease relationships. However, the resulting association estimates are often subject to biases due to random and systematic measurement errors. Regression calibration has emerged as a crucial method for addressing these biases by refining self-reported nutrient intake with objective biomarkers, which differ from the true values only by a random \"noise\" component. This paper presents methodological tools for analyzing nutritional epidemiology cohort studies involving time-to-event data when a biomarker subsample is available alongside dietary assessments. We introduce novel regression calibration methods to tackle two common challenges in this field. First, a widely used approach assumes that the log hazard ratio (HR) follows a linear function of dietary exposure. However, assessing whether this assumption holds-or if a more flexible model is needed to capture potential deviations from linearity-is often necessary. Second, another prevalent analytical strategy involves estimating HRs based on categorized dietary exposure variables. New methods are critically needed to minimize bias in defining category boundaries and estimating hazard ratios within exposure categories, both of which can be distorted by measurement error. We apply these methods to reassess the relationship between sodium and potassium intake and cardiovascular disease risk using data from the Women's Health Initiative.",

Importantly, this effect of CSF on leukemia methotrexate sensitivity was reversible. Additional mechanistic studies support that diminished proliferation and activation of the integrated stress response in leukemia cells in the CSF may contribute to this resistance.

        "AbstractText": "Epigenetic alterations have been found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but the functional importance of these changes remains underexplored. Here, we characterized the genome-wide histone modification landscapes of CLL using patient-derived samples across the disease course. Compared with normal B cells, we found that the enhancers specifically lost in CLL B cells are associated with the downregulation of genes involved in immune response. Importantly, these lost enhancers exhibit an increased level of heterochromatin marks, including H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. Using the EBF1 gene locus as an example, we demonstrated that acquired H3K9me3 contributes to enhancer silencing and associated gene suppression. We further found that this aberrant chromatin signature also exists in the CLL precursor stage monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) cells, implicating the importance of epigenetic silencing in CLL evolution. Finally, when treated with the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib, these silenced enhancers are relatively stable during therapy compared with the CLL-gained enhancers. In summary, we described an epigenetic silencing mechanism mediated by the heterochromatin that persists throughout CLL disease development and treatment and which may increase the risk of severe infections in MBL and CLL.",

We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of VEN-HMA treatment in octogenarians and nonagenarians to further understand the tolerability, feasibility, dosing considerations, and clinical efficacy in this unique group. Patients with AML aged \u226580 years who received VEN-HMA between March 2015 and April 2022 were reviewed. VEN-HMA dosing was determined by treating physician, accounting for CYP3A4 drug interaction dose adjustments. In total, 154 patients were included, with a median age of 82 years (range, 80-92), who received treatment with VEN-HMA (83% with azacitidine and 17% with decitabine). Most patients (53%) had European LeukemiaNet 2017 adverse risk AML, 33% had intermediate, 8% had favorable, and 6% were unknown. With a median follow-up of 7.7\u00a0months, 36 patients (23%) remained in remission, with 31 (20%) still on VEN-HMA. The 30-day and 60-day mortality rates were 8.5% and 17%, respectively. The composite complete remission (CRc) rate for patients with newly diagnosed AML without prior myelodysplastic syndrome was 73% (48 of 66). Median overall survival (OS) was 8.1\u00a0months, and in patients who achieved a response (CRc), median OS was 13.2\u00a0months. Landmark analysis from the time CRc was first achieved showed that patients receiving VEN for \u226414\u00a0days had improved OS; median, 24.0\u00a0months.

The microspheres exhibited desirable aerodynamic diameter, high drug loading and encapsulation efficiency, as well as a favorable drug release profile, which was beneficial for the deposition and exposure of drugs in the lung tissues. The release solution from microspheres exhibited a favorable anti-proliferative effect by inducting cell apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle at G1 phase, and meanwhile inhibited the migration and invasion of cancer cells. More importantly, the microspheres could be effectively inhaled and accumulated in the lung tissues to trigger the in situ apoptosis of tumor cells and suppress metastasis, using mice bearing melanoma-metastatic lung cancer as a model. Furthermore, inhalation of the microspheres showed favorable biocompatibility, barely causing tissue damage. Overall, porous PLGA microspheres provide a promising platform for the inhalable co-delivery of drugs and genes to obtain ideal therapeutic efficacy in lung cancer and other pulmonary diseases.",

Overall, patients with TRG1 show good sensitivity to NCRT but the long-term survival for these patients remains different. This study aimed to assess the prognostic factors in patients with TRG1. METHODS: LARC patients who underwent NCRT and radical surgery were included. TRG was evaluated according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The association between clinicopathological factors and survival outcomes was assessed in patients with TRG1. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated using both Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Of the 393 LARC patients, 104 (26.5%) were diagnosed with TRG1. The 5-year OS rates and 5-year DFS rates of patients with TRG1 were 90.9% and 72.2%, respectively. In patients with TRG1, the tumor regression pattern (P\u2009=\u20090.001), pathologic tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage (P\u2009=\u20090.002), neoadjuvant rectal score (P\u2009=\u20090.024), T downstaging (P\u2009=\u20090.022), and baseline carcinoembryonic antigen level (P\u2009=\u20090.038) were associated with DFS in univariate analysis. Only the tumor regression pattern showed prognostic significance for DFS in multivariate analysis (P\u2009=\u20090.003). The group with tumor shrinkage had a higher OS rate than the tumor fragmentation group but the difference in the OS rates between the two groups was not significant (P\u2009=\u20090.196). CONCLUSIONS: TRG could be a prognostic variable for LARC patients receiving NCRT. In patients with TRG1, the tumor regression pattern may represent another useful prognostic factor to better individualize the prognosis.",

A simple and less invasive treatment for SUI in these patients is urgently needed. Deflux is a viscous gel that consists of a mixture of sodium hyaluronate and dextranomer beads. It is administered by transurethral approach for the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux. In this study, we aim to establish a minimally invasive treatment for post-prostatectomy SUI through transurethral Deflux injection. METHODS: We will perform a single-center, exploratory clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transurethral injection of Deflux for SUI after RARP. Inclusion criteria are patients with SUI, a urine leakage volume between 15 and 500\u00a0g in a 24-h pad test, and those who use more than two pads per day. Five patients are scheduled to be enrolled in this pilot study. Deflux is injected endoscopically at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions in the submucosa until coaptation of submucosal bulking is achieved from both intraurethral sides. The primary endpoint is safety following Deflux injection. The secondary endpoint is efficacy on both SUI volume and patients' QOL.

ZW27941 exhibited potent and selective degradation of METTL3 and its binding partner METTL14, leading to significant anti-leukemic activity in AML cell lines. Furthermore, ZW27941 demonstrated synergistic or additive effects when combined with standard AML therapeutics, such as cytarabine and venetoclax.

Nevertheless, due to the significant fluctuations in reproductive hormone levels observed in patients receiving this novel technology, concerns have been raised regarding the potential increased risk of breast cancer associated with this treatment. The outcomes of pertinent clinical investigations exhibit significant disparities, leading to a lack of consensus regarding the association between ART and susceptibility to breast cancer. The primary objective of this study is to systematically evaluate the impact of ART on the risk of breast cancer. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and Meta-analysis Guidelines for Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Researchers conducted an extensive electronic search across databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, encompassing all articles published over the last two decades (from January 2003 to December 2023). Two independent researchers meticulously examined the titles and abstracts of the literature based on predetermined inclusion criteria and research qualifications. Through collaborative deliberation, they identified the literature to be incorporated in the following analysis. Researchers will extract data in accordance with predetermined tables and perform quality assessments and implement bias control measures for each literature. Researchers will conduct a meta-analysis based on the extracted data to assess the overall risk and subgroup risks. The analysis will employ the odds ratio as the summary statistic and will use fixed or random effects models for estimation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings of this systematic review will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at international medical conferences, with the aim of reaching both medical professionals and the general public.

Clone size correlated with anemia severity and thrombocytosis in del(5q) cases, and with anemia and blast percentage in complex karyotypes. TP53 mutation prevalence was significantly elevated in patients with clone size of \u226525% compared with those with <25% (34.2% vs 3%; P\u00a0= .07). Complex karyotypes with clone size of \u226575% demonstrated superior response to hypomethylating agents (20.8% vs 10%; P\u00a0= .03).

Subsequently, we analyzed over 24\u2009000 primary human BM cells enriched for the nonhematopoietic compartment by using whole bone fragments from n\u00a0= 8 patients with MDS and n\u00a0= 7 healthy, age-matched donors. In PDX who received MDS transplantation, mesenchymal cell (MSC) subpopulations were forced to overexpress hematopoietic factors such as Cxcl12 and Il7 upon contact with hematopoietic MDS cells as compared with healthy grafts. Single-cell analyses of primary in situ BM cells from patients with MDS showed highly heterogeneous MSC subpopulations on a patient-individual level. We identified inflammatory gene expression profiles as well as overexpression of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12, KIT ligand, and Interleukin 7 in MDS MSCs and endothelial cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate reprogramming of the BM microenvironment by MDS cells, pointing to altered MSC subpopulations with increased growth factor expression profiles in a subgroup of patients with MDS.",

We used data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) linkage between Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and Medicare claims to evaluate the overall survival of patients with FL receiving 3 to 4 vs 5 to 6 cycles of bendamustine. Patients receiving 1 to 2 cycles of bendamustine chemotherapy were not included. Patients receiving 5 to 6 cycles of bendamustine were significantly younger (mean age, 75.0 vs 76.2 years; P\u00a0< .01) and had fewer comorbidities by the NCI comorbidity index (mean score, 1.7\u00a0vs 2.0; P\u00a0= .05) than those receiving 3 to 4 cycles of bendamustine, and on univariate analysis exhibited significantly lower risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.98; P\u00a0= .04).

Dosing flexibility (adjustment to daily dose of <420\u00a0mg/d) with ibrutinib can help prevent recurrence or worsening of adverse events while maintaining long-term efficacy. This study compared time to next treatment among patients with CLL/SLL in the United States initiating 1L single-agent ibrutinib at 420\u00a0mg/d (index date) and staying on this dose vs patients with dose adjustment (DA) within 3 to 12\u00a0months. Two databases were used: Komodo claims (a majority from community practices) and Acentrus electronic medical records (from academic and nonteaching hospital systems). To account for immortal time bias (patients with DA survived on 1L therapy until DA) and overlap between follow-up time and definition of treatment strategies, a target trial emulation approach was used, in which patients were cloned at index date and contributed follow-up to both treatment strategy arms until deviation from the strategy. Among 3343 patients in Komodo (mean age: 67.5 years; 37.6% female) and 1171 patients in Acentrus (mean age: 70.4 years; 34.6% female) who initiated 1L single-agent ibrutinib 420\u00a0mg/d, 18.0% and 19.6%, respectively, had a DA.

Numerous other CD38-targeting therapeutics are currently in preclinical or clinical development. Here, we sought to extend our currently limited insight into CD38 surface expression by using a multiomics approach. Genome-wide CRISPR interference screens integrated with patient-centered epigenetic analysis confirmed known regulators of CD38, such as RARA, while revealing XBP1 and SPI1 as other key transcription factors governing surface CD38 levels. CD38 knockdown followed by cell surface proteomics demonstrated no significant remodeling of the myeloma \"surfaceome\" after genetically induced loss of this antigen. Integrated transcriptome and surface proteome data confirmed high specificity of all-trans retinoic acid in upregulating CD38, in contrast to the broader effects of azacytidine and panobinostat. Finally, unbiased phosphoproteomics identified inhibition of MAP kinase pathway signaling in tumor cells after daratumumab treatment.

RESULTS: Twenty-seven participants (42.9%) completed the survey and n=21 (33.3%; n=8 caregivers, 38.1%, n=13 survivors, 61.9%) recorded diaries. Eighty percent (n=21) of the sample received the COVID-19 vaccine. Two themes illustrated the impact of COVID-19 vaccines within a cancer context: Providing hope and Reconnecting with life. CONCLUSION: Vaccination decisions allowed many cancer survivors and partners to reengage with their social networks. With limited guidance, many relied on their own knowledge, values, and experiences to determine how to preserve their health. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Utilizing a shared decision-making model, nurses can help families develop strategies that enact their values to promote long-term health. Nursing education and support can be further strengthened to create patient self-efficacy when navigating social interactions in the post-COVID era. FOUNDATIONAL: This study addresses the need for improved self-management strategies for cancer survivors.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs), harboring stem cell-like properties involving self-renewal and aberrant differentiation potential, have been known to be one of the determining factors that contribute to therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence. However, much remains to be understood about the reprogramming network leading to the generation of CSCs driven by chemotherapy. In this study, guided by bioinformatics study, we uncover and provide deeper insight into the CSC enrichment mechanism driven by cisplatin (CDDP) treatment. We discover that CDDP can repopulate the level of CSC by activating AKT1 oncogenic pathway that is further enhanced by COX-2 inflammatory signaling. Simultaneously blocking these two pathways can synergistically restrain the number of CSCs. Under the guidance of a series of advanced hierarchical computational modeling, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and binding free energy analysis, MK-2206 is selected as the AKT1 inhibitor to achieve optimal codelivery of CDDP, MK-2206 and 5-ASA (COX-2 inhibitor) through the use of 5-ASA-derivatized dual functional immunostimulatory nanocarrier (PASA). This triple combination (PASA/CDDP/MK-2206) significantly reduces tumor burden in both orthotopic and metastatic lung cancer models. Mechanistic studies show that this improved therapeutic activity is due to elimination of CSCs and reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Our study suggests that PASA/CDDP/MK-2206 may represent a simple and effective lung cancer therapy via reversing CSCs-associated chemoresistance.",

Early diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial to prevent complications. Symptoms typically include nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and hearing loss. Imaging techniques, such as contrast-enhanced CT and MRI, play a pivotal role in assessing tumor size, vascularity, and involvement of surrounding structures. Angiography, followed by embolization, is commonly used to reduce intraoperative bleeding risk. The treatment of choice is surgical resection, which can be performed via an endonasal, transpalatal, or combined approach, depending on tumor extent. In cases of inoperable tumors or recurrence, radiation therapy may be considered.

        "AbstractText": "Background In tropical countries like Nepal, the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded within a population already grappling with various tropical infectious diseases. Co-infection with malaria and dengue holds clinical significance when managing COVID-19 patients in regions endemic to these diseases. Objective To identify malaria and dengue infections in febrile or symptomatic patients suspected of COVID-19 at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu. Method Over two months, a prospective study was conducted on febrile or symptomatic patients suspected of COVID-19 visiting Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu. One hundred and twenty-three patients suspected of COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR as well as for malaria and dengue infection using rapid diagnostic test kits. Result Out of 123 patients suspected of COVID-19, 64 were confirmed to have COVID-19. No evidence of SARS-CoV-2 and malaria co-infection was found among the 123 tested patients. However, two patients admitted for COVID-19 tested positive for dengue virus infection. The patients with co-infections with dengue or scrub typhus were likely to have a longer hospital stays (OR 2.5; 95% CI: 0.22-29.26), though lacking a significant association. Conclusion The two patients diagnosed with dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 were identified during their hospital visit and both recovered after receiving treatment. Given that COVID-19 patients manifest symptoms resembling many tropical infectious diseases, the study underscores the clinical importance of testing for multiple circulating infections in patients from endemic areas. This approach ensures appropriate and timely management reducing the risk of severity or mortality.",

        "AbstractText": "Advancements in mRNA-based therapeutics have greatly enhanced cancer immunotherapy by using the immune system to specifically target and eradicate cancer cells. There has been notable advancement in tailoring and administering mRNA to treat cancer. Codon optimization, chemical alterations, and sequence manipulation are complex design methodologies employed in the production of mRNA vaccines and treatments. The goal is to improve the ability of the chemicals to stimulate an immune response, increase their ability to be translated into practical applications, and boost their stability. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most efficient means of delivering mRNA because they can withstand degradation, enhance cellular uptake, and facilitate endosomal escape. Scientists are currently investigating the possibility of using alternate methods of delivering substances, including as exosomes, lipoplexes, and polymeric nanoparticles, to enhance the ability to target specific tissues and minimize unwanted negative consequences. In addition, recent clinical trials and preclinical investigations have demonstrated encouraging findings in terms of the advancement of strong anti-tumor immune responses, long-lasting tumor shrinkage, and enhanced patient outcomes. The remaining challenges involve optimizing the equilibrium between tolerance and immunological activation, addressing systemic toxicity, and expanding manufacturing techniques. The upcoming study seeks to improve the design and dissemination of mRNA, include it in combination drugs, and investigate its therapeutic uses outside cancer.

Nucleic acid therapy has advanced significantly in the interim. The diverse capabilities of nucleic acid therapies, gene-editing guide RNA (gRNA), immunomodulatory DNA/RNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA and siRNA, plasmids, and antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), for modification of immune responses and change the target endogenous or synthetic gene's expression, make them appealing. These skills can be extremely important in the creation of innovative immunotherapy approaches. To be effective, these treatments must, however, overcome a number of delivery challenges, such as quick in vivo disintegration, inadequate absorption inside target cells, necessary nuclear entrance, along with possible in-vivo toxic potential in tissues and cells that are healthy. Several of these obstacles have been addressed by the development of nanoparticle delivery methods, which allow nucleic acid therapies to be safely and successfully delivered to immune cells.

        "AbstractText": "mRNA carries genetic information and is used for the synthesis of proteins, fragments of proteins, and peptides in the scope of biotechnology and medicine. Once introduced into cells, this mRNA gets translated into a corresponding protein with cellular machinery. All kinds of mRNA encoding any protein, peptide, and fragment of proteins have been designed to be used for various therapeutic goals, including cancerous diseases, immunotherapy, vaccine preparation, tissue engineering, and genetic disorders, among others. These vaccines encode tumor-specific antigens that stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Additionally, mRNA can be designed to produce proteins that modulate immune checkpoints, thereby enhancing the immune system's ability to target cancer cells. Synthetic mRNA can also engineer immune cells, such as T cells, to improve their cancer-fighting capabilities. For instance, mRNA can be engineered to generate CAR T cells targeting specific antigens that are expressed in the cancer. Designed mRNA can encode functional proteins in patients suffering from genetic disorders characterized by an absence or defect in a particular protein. However, mRNA is intrinsically unstable and may require special mechanisms to protect it from degradation. mRNA delivery to target cells remains a challenge. Engineered nanocarriers containing mRNA can improve the efficiency and enable the delivery to specific sites, that can provide a stimulant or substance for therapeutic purposes. This combination may improve their stability and efficacy in multiple applications of therapies.

With the rising incidence of melanoma diagnoses, there is an urgent need to develop effective treatments. Among the most modern approaches are cancer vaccines, which aim to enhance cell-mediated immunity. Recently, mRNA-based cancer vaccines have gained significant attention due to their rapid production, low manufacturing costs, and ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. These vaccines hold great potential in melanoma treatment, yet their application faces several challenges, including mRNA stabilization, delivery methods, and tumor heterogeneity. The recent success of mRNA vaccines in combating COVID-19 has renewed interest in their potential for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, mRNA cancer vaccines offer high specificity and better efficacy compared to traditional treatments. They can target tumor-specific neoantigens, prompting a robust immune response. This chapter reviews the mechanism of action of mRNA vaccines, advancements in adjuvant identification, and innovations in delivery systems such as lipid nanoparticles. It also discusses ongoing clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of mRNA-based vaccines in melanoma, highlighting promising early-phase results. Despite their potential, the development of mRNA cancer vaccines faces significant obstacles. Tumor heterogeneity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, and practical issues like vaccine administration and clinical evaluation methods are major barriers to success. By addressing these challenges and advancing innovations, mRNA cancer vaccines hold promise for transforming melanoma treatment. A careful balance between the opportunities and challenges will be key to unlocking the full potential of mRNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy.",

It relies on an ImageNet-based feature extractor, making its applicability to medical imaging unclear. A recent trend is to adapt FID to medical imaging through feature extractors trained on medical images. Our study challenges this practice by demonstrating that ImageNet-based extractors are more consistent and aligned with human judgment than their RadImageNet counterparts. We evaluated sixteen StyleGAN2 networks across four medical imaging modalities and four data augmentation techniques with Fr\u00e9chet distances (FDs) computed using eleven ImageNet or RadImageNet-trained feature extractors. Comparison with human judgment via visual Turing tests revealed that ImageNet-based extractors produced rankings consistent with human judgment, with the FD derived from the ImageNet-trained SwAV extractor significantly correlating with expert evaluations. In contrast, RadImageNet-based rankings were volatile and inconsistent with human judgment.

Indeed, syndromes including cachexia, cardiotoxicity, fatigue, and mucositis among others plague cancer survivors, leading to poor life quality and premature mortality. The systemic nature of these impairments creates a strong rationale for treatment strategies to mitigate syndromes affecting cancer survivors. Currently, however, there are limited treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to counter the debilitating side effects of cancer and cancer treatments.

        "AbstractText": "Conventional inhibitors of immune checkpoints such as anti-programmed death-1 and its ligand (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4) have revolutionized therapeutic approaches to cancer, establishing immunotherapy as the standard of care for many cancers. A significant number of cancers, however, remain refractory to the inhibition of these immune checkpoints, leading to the search for alternative immune checkpoints that are more relevant to those diseases. Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-mediated efferocytosis is an increasingly appreciated immune checkpoint with a profound impact on the phenotype of the tumor microenvironment (TME). TAMs perform their efferocytic function through the receptor MerTK, and MerTK activity correlates with tumor progression. To combat efferocytosis in the TME, we developed poly[[2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate]-b-poly(methacrylamidomannose)] nanoparticles (PMAM NPs) capable of encapsulating and preferentially delivering UNC2025 (a MerTK inhibitor) to TAMs. The NPs had suitable physicochemical properties, such as a size of 130 nm and a neutral surface charge. The PMAM NPs encapsulated hydrophobic cargo and released them in a pH-dependent manner, showing suitability for cytosolic delivery. Moreover, the PMAM NPs showed 12-fold greater macrophage internalization than traditional PEGMA NPs. Macrophage internalization was shown to be dependent on the mannose receptor CD206, as the blockade of CD206 led to a significant decrease in PMAM NP internalization. Furthermore, PMAM NPs had a lower internalization than PEGMA NPs in 4T1 cancer cells that do not express CD206, further confirming macrophage selectivity. In vivo biodistribution studies showed the PMAM NPs were capable of internalization by TAMs in the TME. Lastly, UNC2025-PMAM NPs significantly reduced tumor volume compared to free UNC2025, showing greater therapeutic efficacy in a model of triple-negative breast cancer. These glycopolymer-based, efferocytosis-blocking NPs have promise both as a class of standalone cancer immunotherapy and as an adjuvant to improve response rates to checkpoint immunotherapy.",

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as a key hydrolase in the cholinergic system directly affects the metabolism of neurotransmitter. Unfortunately, owing to the lack of reliable in situ imaging tools in the brain, the association between AChE and epilepsy has not been fully elucidated yet. Here, we rationally designed a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe (QXMC) by employing N,N-dimethyl carbamyl as an AChE sensing group in the quinolinium-xanthene NIR skeleton. QXMC exhibited high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and ultrafast response time (within 0.5 s) toward AChE. Moreover, QXMC can sensitively monitor the fluctuations of AChE activity in the neuronal cells and zebrafish during the apoptosis or oxidative stress process. Significantly, using QXMC with superb blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, for the first time, we discovered a down-regulated AChE level in the acute epileptic mice brain through noninvasive NIR in vivo imaging. Moreover, the visualization of therapeutic evaluation of epilepsy has also been achieved by monitoring AChE with QXMC.

Among these, pleomorphic adenoma stands out as a distinct benign tumor of the salivary glands, characterized by a combination of epithelial and mesenchymal elements.Only 0.3% to 1.5%, of biopsies in oral and Maxillofacial pathology laboratories are associated with tumors originating from minor salivary glands. Keratinizing pleomorphic adenoma, a rare variant accounting for 5-10% of all pleomorphic adenomas, differs from the typical form due to the presence of keratin within the tumor cells, serving as a distinguishing histological feature. The incidence of keratinizing pleomorphic adenoma is not well-established but is believed to be less than 1 case per 100,000 people per year. Here we present an atypical histopathological variation of pleomorphic adenoma, featuring extensive keratinization and manifesting in a less typical anatomical location in a 57-year-old male patient.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine condition that is frequently misdiagnosed, and its prevalence is rising rapidly worldwide. Adolescent girls often lack adequate knowledge about PCOS. This study examined the prevalence of PCOS and awareness among female adolescents. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted among female adolescents from selected educational institutions in the north zone of Hyderabad. Institutions were carefully chosen to represent a diverse student population. Data were collected and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25. The Chi-square test of independence and logistic regression were employed to identify variables associated with PCOS knowledge levels. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-two female adolescents participated. The mean age was 18.19 years (\u00b10.92 SD). Forty-four participants were diagnosed with PCOS (11.5%), and 17.3% were suspected PCOS. Over 89% of participants demonstrated good knowledge across various PCOS domains. A significant association was found between the level of education and learning about PCOS (p=0.05). There was a weak positive correlation between the level of study and knowledge scores (p=0.05). Bivariate and multivariate logistic analysis revealed that university girls [AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: (1.12-3.25)] and those with PCOS [AOR: 6.8, 95% CI: (1.4-32.4)] were more knowledgeable than their counterparts with lower education levels and without PCOS, respectively. CONCLUSION: While knowledge of PCOS among female adolescents was generally good, the disease burden was high. Targeted counseling and lifestyle management interventions are essential to prevent long-term complications of PCOS.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Nano-based perivascular intervention sustains a nine-month long-term suppression of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts.",
        "AbstractText": "Open vascular reconstructions (OVR), including bypass grafts and dialysis access, are standard treatments for cardiovascular and renal diseases. Unfortunately, OVR often fail largely due to intimal hyperplasia (IH), and there are no clinical methods to prevent this complication. Perivascular drug administration during OVR presents a promising strategy for IH suppression. However, durations of drug release from carriers are generally short whereas sustained efficacy is essential for clinical success. This raises a critical question in clinical translation: can IH suppression be realistically maintained long-term (e.g., over 6 months) with short-term perivascular interventions? To address this question, we modified a rat vein-graft model to prolong IH progression. We then applied Pericelle, a nanoparticle/hydrogel hybrid system that we developed for perivascular delivery of rapamycin, an established IH-inhibitory drug. Surprisingly, despite short (\u223c3-month) drug release, Pericelle demonstrated IH suppression throughout 3, 6, and 9 months with IH reduced from 115.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027.89 to 40.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.18\u00a0at 9 months (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, n\u00a0=\u00a06 rats), as indicated by morphometric analysis. Live animal ultrasonography showed the same trend. Consistently, histone-3 lysine-27 trimethylation, an epigenetic mark associated with IH progression, was decreased at 6 months after Pericelle treatment. Moreover, Pericelle exhibited promising efficacy in mitigating IH in a porcine model of arteriovenous fistula that mimics dialysis access. These results suggest that Pericelle-mediated suppression of IH in rat vein-grafts extends much beyond drug release, offering potential solutions to longstanding translational challenges in reducing OVR failure.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) pathotype is implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis. AIEC strains are currently defined by phenotypic measurement of their pathogenicity, including invasion of epithelial cells. This broad definition, combined with the genetic diversity of AIEC across patients with IBD, has complicated the identification of virulence determinants. We sought to quantify the invasion phenotype of clinical isolates from patients with IBD and identify the genetic basis for their invasion into epithelial cells. METHODS: A pangenome with core and accessory genes (genotype) was assembled using whole genome sequencing of 168 E coli samples isolated from 13 patients with IBD. A modified assay for invasion of epithelial cells (phenotype) was established with consideration of antibiotic resistance phenotypes. Isolate genotype was correlated to invasiveness phenotype to identify genetic factors that cosegregate with invasion. RESULTS: Pangenome-wide comparisons of E coli clinical isolates identified accessory genes that can cosegregate with invasion phenotype. These correlations found the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes in clinical isolates compromised the traditional gentamicin protection assays used to quantify invasion. Therefore, an alternate assay, based on amikacin resistance, identified genes cosegregating with invasion. These genes encode an arylsulfatase, a glycoside hydrolase, and genetic islands carrying propanediol utilization and sulfoquinovose metabolism pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of incorporating antibiotic resistance screening for invasion assays used in AIEC identification. Accurately screened invasion phenotypes identified accessory genome elements among E coli IBD isolates that correlate with their ability to invade epithelial cells. These results help explain why single genetic markers for the AIEC phylotype are challenging to identify.",

The current treatment of colorectal MC is not precise enough, and the molecular characteristics remain unclear. The study aims to explore the difference between colorectal MC and AD on the transcriptome level for the possibility of treating colorectal MC precisely. METHODS: The data of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was assessed, and then differential analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed to identify the differential hub RNAs between colorectal MC and AD. Differential hub lncRNAs and hub RNA of significant modules were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) among different colon cancer cell lines. RESULTS: In total, 1680 differential expressed RNAs (DERs) were found by comparing colorectal MC (52, 13.3%) with AD (340, 86.7%). Through the WGCNA, a mucin-associated RNA module was identified, while some others might be associated with unique immune progress. Finally, 6 differential hub RNAs in the mucin-associated RNA module (CTD-2589M5.4, RP11-234B24.2, RP11-25K19.1 and COLCA1) were validated by qRT-PCR and showed higher expression levels in mucin-producing colorectal cell lines (Ls174T and HT-29). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that clinical treatments for colorectal MC should be differentiated from AD. Further exploration of enterocyte (goblet cell) differentiation with tumor genesis and the distinct immune progression of MC may help to identify key therapeutic targets for colorectal MC. Further research on the application of immunotherapy to colorectal MC is needed.",

        "AbstractText": "AIMS: This study aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets in the progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with a focus on genes that could influence disease development and progression. BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma, significantly driven by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, represents a major global health challenge due to late-stage diagnosis and limited treatment options. This study utilized bioinformatics to analyze data from GEO and TCGA, aiming to uncover molecular biomarkers that bridge NAFLD to HCC. Through identifying critical genes and pathways, our research seeks to advance early detection and develop targeted therapies, potentially improving prognosis and personalizing treatment for NAFLD-HCC patients. OBJECTIVES: Identify key genes that differ between NAFLD and HCC; Analyze these genes to understand their roles in disease progression; Validate the functions of these genes in NAFLD to HCC transition. METHODS: Initially, we identified a set of genes differentially expressed in both NAFLD and HCC using second-generation sequencing data from the GEO and TCGA databases. We then employed a Cox proportional hazards model and a Lasso regression model, applying machine learning techniques to the large sample data from TCGA. This approach was used to screen for key disease-related genes, and an external dataset was utilized for model validation. Additionally, pseudo-temporal sequencing analysis of single-cell sequencing data was performed to further examine the variations in these genes in NAFLD and HCC. RESULTS: The machine learning analysis identified IGSF3, CENPW, CDT1, and CDC6 as key genes. Furthermore, constructing a machine learning model for CDT1 revealed it to be the most critical gene, with model validation yielding an ROC value greater than 0.80. The single-cell sequencing data analysis confirmed significant variations in the four predicted key genes between the NAFLD and HCC groups. CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the pivotal role of CDT1 in the progression from NAFLD to HCC.

Despite the availability of various treatment options, many patients still endure significant pruritus. This double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to assess and compare the safety and efficacy of mirtazapine and hydroxyzine in treating UP and improving sleep quality in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients in the mirtazapine group received 15 mg/night (7.5 mg for the first two nights) with a hydroxyzine placebo, while 28 patients in the hydroxyzine group received 25 mg/night (12.5 mg for the first two nights) with a mirtazapine placebo for 2 weeks. UP was assessed using the 5D-itch scale, and sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at baseline, weeks 2, 3, and 4. Adverse effects were recorded using the Antidepressant Side Effect Checklist at each visit from baseline to week 2. FINDINGS: UP ratings based on the 5D-itch scale decreased for both groups, with a more significant reduction in the mirtazapine group (P = 0.04). The mirtazapine group also showed a significant improvement in the PSQI compared to hydroxyzine (P = 0.01). Dry mouth was the only notable adverse effect, occurring more frequently in the mirtazapine group (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that short-term treatment with mirtazapine is more effective than hydroxyzine in reducing the severity of UP and improving sleep quality for patients undergoing hemodialysis.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing health concern, particularly in Africa, and is predicted to become the leading cause of death after cancer by 2050. Factors like overuse or inappropriate use of antibiotics contribute to this crisis. People living with HIV (PLWH) are particularly vulnerable to AMR with potential drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral and antimicrobial agents against common organisms like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There is limited data on the concentrations of commonly used antimicrobial agents in people living with HIV in resource-limited settings. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) offers a promising approach to optimize antibiotic dosing and improve treatment outcomes for those with sub-optimal drug concentrations. TDM has been recommended for PLWH on anti-tuberculosis treatment due to sub-optimal drug concentrations found in a significant proportion of those with TB. OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this study are to determine the concentrations of selected antimicrobial agents in people living with HIV requiring antimicrobial therapy and to assess the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in achieving therapeutic targets for PLWH receiving rifampicin and isoniazid for the treatment of tuberculosis. METHODS: This prospective observational study will enroll adult PLWH receiving amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, isoniazid, or ceftriaxone. Concentrations of these antibiotics will be measured locally using validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods and high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. TDM with dose adjustment will be performed in a subset of participants on TB treatment. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using non-linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: This study was reviewed and approved by the research and ethics committee in February 2024. Participant enrolment began in September 2024. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that the findings from this research will characterize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics relationships to predict treatment response for optimal antimicrobial therapeutic and anti-tuberculosis dosing among people living with HIV (PLWH).

GA inhibits cancer cell proliferation by interfering with many apoptotic signaling pathways, producing more reactive oxygen species (ROS), focusing on the cell cycle, and suppressing the expression of oncogenes and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study, thymoquinone (after reducing to thymohydroquinone) and gallic acid are esterified to form thymohydroquinyl gallate (a prodrug). Thymohydroquinyl gallate (THQG) possesses enhanced antineoplastic efficacy and targeted delivery potential. The chemical and spectroscopic analysis confirms ester synthesis. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed as nanocarriers due to their physicochemical and optical characteristics, biocompatibility, and low toxicity. As an efficient drug transporter, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) shield conjugated drugs from enzymatic digestion. The prodrug acts as a reducing agent for Au metal atoms and is loaded onto it after reduction. The nano drug is radiolabeled with 99mTc and 131I to monitor the drug biodistribution in animals using a gamma camera and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). 131I is an antineoplastic that helps enhance the drug's efficiency.

The dataset comprised 12 specific symptoms, with severity and distress for each symptom rated on a 1 to 10 scale, generating a \"total symptom score\" ranging from 0 to 230. To address the challenge of an unbalanced original dataset, where Class I (score change \u2265 5) and Class II (score change < 5) were unevenly represented, we created a balanced dataset specifically for model training. This process involved a stratified sampling technique to ensure equitable representation of both classes, enhancing the predictive analysis. Using the MATLAB\u00ae Classification Learner application, we investigated nine ML models, including decision trees, discriminant analysis, support vector machines (SVM), and others, each applying various classifiers. The objective was to predict the total symptom score change based on the preceding 3 to 5 days' symptom data. Models were trained on the balanced dataset to mitigate the original imbalance's impact, with comparative evaluations also conducted on the unbalanced data to assess performance differences. The analysis revealed that certain classifiers, such as SVM, delivered optimal performance on the unbalanced dataset, with an accuracy rate peaking at 82%. Yet, these models tended to frequently misclassify Class I as Class II. In contrast, the Ensemble algorithm equipped with the RUSBoost classifier demonstrated exceptional skill in accurately classifying both classes on both datasets, achieving accuracies of 59%, 59.3%, and 59.4% for data from 3, 4, and 5 days prior, respectively. Notably, these figures slightly improved to 61.16%, 58.41%, and 60.05% upon utilizing the balanced dataset for training. The deployment of a balanced dataset for model training underscores the significant potential of ML algorithms in improving symptom management for chemotherapy patients, offering a path to enhanced patient care and quality of life through targeted, personalized symptom monitoring.",

        "AbstractText": "This study introduces a groundbreaking approach to early cancer detection through the analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), utilizing machine learning algorithms to navigate the complexities of low circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fractions and genetic heterogeneity. CfDNA, found in bodily fluids and comprising fragments from apoptotic or necrotic cells, offers a non-invasive means to identify cancer signals. With ctDNA-a subset of cfDNA from cancer cells-serving as a biomarker, the potential for detecting cancer at its earliest stages is vastly improved, enhancing treatment effectiveness and patient prognosis. However, the challenges of distinguishing cancer-specific signatures within cfDNA due to low ctDNA levels and the noise of genetic heterogeneity necessitate advanced methods beyond traditional mutation analysis. Leveraging high-throughput sequencing technologies and the precision of machine learning, our research aims to surmount these obstacles by identifying nuanced cancer signatures within cfDNA sequencing data. Machine learning's capability to model complex data relationships allows for the differentiation of subtle oncogenic patterns from background noise, thereby increasing the diagnostic accuracy of liquid biopsies. This paper outlines our exploration into employing machine learning for early cancer detection via cfDNA, detailing our method of transforming sequencing data into analyzable formats, enhancing signal detection through a sliding window technique, and predicting true tumor-origin fragments. By advancing cfDNA-based cancer diagnostics, this research not only signifies a leap towards more sensitive and specific early-stage cancer detection but also opens avenues for personalized oncology, where treatment strategies are informed by the unique genetic profile unveiled through cfDNA analysis. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating artificial intelligence with liquid biopsy technologies to revolutionize cancer diagnostics, offering new hope for early detection and personalized treatment pathways.",

RealRisks, an online decision aid constructed by our team to provide education on BC risk and personalized risk assessment, allows users the option to connect to their electronic health record (EHR) to extract requisite data to calculate BC risk via Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Using data from RealRisks user profiles, baseline questionnaires, and interview transcripts, we sought to understand the differences between the groups of patients who opted to download their data via the EHR vs. those who did not. A higher percentage of those who downloaded data (53.8% vs. 42.3%) identified as Hispanic/Latino compared to those who did not download.

Quantifying breast arterial calcification (BAC) from screening mammograms is a non-invasive and cost-efficient approach to assess the future risk of adverse cardiovascular events among women, such as heart attack and stroke. However, segmentation of breast arterial calcification is an involved task and poses several technical challenges such as extremely small BAC finding, low breast arteries to breast area ratio in the mammogram images, tissue features such as breast folds and heterogeneous density, have very similar imaging appearance. In this work, we aim to address the shortcomings of existing SOTA methods, e.g., SCUNet, and analyze the comparative performance. Given the fact that we will not be able to simply resize mammogram to preserve the microscopic BAC details, we adopted a patch-based methodology for segmentation using the original resolution which may hinder the model understanding of whole mammogram. We propose a multi-task learning approach for patch-based BAC segmentation by adding an auxiliary task of patch position prediction which forces the model to learn breast anatomy to comprehend the locations where BAC will not occur, such as breast boundary. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the baselines. To demonstrate the utility, we also validate our method on external data and provide survival analysis for adverse cardiac events based on difference in BAC score and provide a comparison with coronary calcium score (CAC).",

Therefore, powering a clinical trial to provide definitive assessment of the effects of an experimental intervention on OS in a reasonable timeframe is generally infeasible. Instead, the primary outcome in many pivotal trials is an intermediate clinical response such as progression-free survival. In several recently reported pivotal trials of interventions for indolent cancers that yielded promising results on an intermediate outcome, however, more mature data or post-approval trials showed concerning OS trends. These problematic results have prompted a keen interest in quantitative approaches for monitoring OS that can support regulatory decision-making related to the risk of an unacceptably large detrimental effect on OS. The US Food and Drug Administration, the American Association for Cancer Research, and the American Statistical Association recently organized a one-day multi-stakeholder workshop entitled \"Overall Survival in Oncology Clinical Trails\". In this paper, we propose OS monitoring guidelines tailored for the setting of indolent cancers.

Traditionally, hypocrellins have been extracted from the fruiting bodies of S. bambusicola, a parasitic fungus on bamboo. However, the yield from wild Shiraia fruiting bodies is often insufficient, prompting a shift towards seeking other fungi with higher yields of hypocrellins as alternative sources. This review comprehensively examines the current research on the isolation, identification, and bioactivity of fungal perylenequinones from Shiraia isolates from ascostromata or fruiting bodies, Shiraia-like endophytes, and other endophytes from bamboos. Additionally, the review discusses the culture methods and conditions for solid-state and submerged fermentation of hypocrellin-producing fungi, including medium components, culture conditions, and optimisation of fermentation factors, as mycelium cultures have emerged as a promising alternative for the production of hypocrellins. Furthermore, novel elicitation strategies are presented to address the bottleneck of lower production of hypocrellins in mycelium cultures, focusing on the preparation, characterisation, and application of biotic and abiotic elicitors.

Therefore, we orally subjected female rats to nTiO2 at 10 and 100 mg/kg body weight for 10 weeks. We found that nTiO2 triggered non-HA PCOS-like symptoms, including the increase of cystic follicles, estrous cycle disorder, and abnormal ovulation, but without high testosterone. By transcriptome sequencing, we identified that nTiO2 exposure inhibited the steroid hormone synthesis and activated the pro-apoptotic pathways. Upon validating these altered pathways, we discovered that aromatase (Cyp19a1) overexpression contributed to the decline in testosterone/estradiol ratio. Meanwhile, the apoptosis of granulosa cells was increased by nTiO2 exposure, which might result in the disorder of follicular development.

The current study aimed to investgate the impacts of BaP exposure on the progression of PCa toward malignancy and the regulation of the immune microenvironment. We verified that BaP exposure can promote the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells through in vitro experiments. We constructed a subcutaneous xenograft tumor model of BaP exposure mouse and found that can promote the proliferation of tumors in vivo. Organoids-driven by PCa patients showed higher growth rate under BaP exposure. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a remarkable decrease in CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell infiltration levels. Moreover, we identified four genes (Mdm2, Ar, Foxo1, Crebbp) were strongly associated with BaP exposure by combining mouse tumor RNA-seq and CTD database. Additionally, a nomogram integrating clinicopathological features was constructed to assess the prognosis of prostate cancer patients under BaP exposure. This study systematically proved that BaP exposure promotes malignant progression of PCa and suppresses the immune microenvironment, in which Mdm2, Ar, Foxo1, Crebbp may play a crucial role in inhibiting apoptosis.

        "ArticleTitle": "ASCCP Clinical Consensus: Screening Recommendations for Clear Cell Adenocarcinomas in People Exposed to DES In Utero.",
        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: The cohort of diethylstilbestrol (DES)-exposed people is aging, and a substantial fraction have already passed the age of 65, when unexposed average-risk people may exit cervical cancer screening provided they have had adequate prior screening. Current guidelines exclude individuals with a history of in utero exposure to DES. This clinical consensus includes a systematic review of relevant studies and provides updated guidance for surveillance of the aging DES-exposed cohort. METHODS: A literature search was performed to find all relevant DES and clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) papers that addressed key clinical questions. Study quality was assessed and recommendations were rated on strength (A-E) and quality of evidence (I-III) using the system described for previous American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology consensus guidelines. RESULTS: DES-exposed patients were 40 times more likely (standardized incidence ratio = 40.9; 95% CI, 13.1-126.2) to develop cervical and vaginal CCAs compared with unexposed individuals, with most cases diagnosed in individuals between the ages of 15 and 31. DES exposure in utero significantly increases the risk of CCA compared with nonexposed people, but the absolute risk of CCA is low. While CCA does seem to occur in older exposed patients, cases were rare and calculated incidence rates were extremely low, with the largest in any of the cohorts at 2.86 per million women-years. CONCLUSIONS: The American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology recommends people with prenatal exposure to DES receive annual screening for CCA with cytology until the age of 65 and discontinue screening beyond the age of 65 provided they otherwise meet criteria for cessation of screening.",

        "AbstractText": "Niche trajectory analysis is a promising framework for modeling spatially continuous variations of the tissue microenvironment. However, the existing approach is limited by its requirement of cell-type annotation as a necessary input, which can lead to unwanted technical variations. To overcome this limitation, a new kernel-based strategy is presented that models the structural composition of a niche as a continuous function in the gene expression space, thereby obviating the need for cell-type annotation. Further integration with cell-type deconvolution analysis extends its application to datasets with any spatial resolution. Applying this strategy to real datasets indicates enhanced performance in robustness and accuracy and provides new insights into injury or disease-associated tissue microenvironment changes. As such, a useful tool for spatial transcriptomics data analysis is provided.",

However even the most promising therapies, for example monoclonal antibodies, require systemic infusion that can limit dosing and lead to off target immunotoxicity. To address such challenges and improve immunotherapy, the field is investing in synthetic biomaterials to target lymph nodes (LNs) - sites of coordinated immune activation and suppression. These synthetic materials allow enhanced targeting, retention, and control over the signals that are required to elicit desired immune processes during immunotherapy. Two broad classes of materials that have been employed for LN targeting include synthetic lipids and polymers. This review will discuss how the chemistries of these materials can be leveraged to improve lymph node targeting of immunotherapies to treat disease. We will also provide commentary on translational barriers to the clinic, an outlook on current therapies that are clinically used, and a forward-looking perspective.",

The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) oversees the quality and registration of biosimilars in Saudi Arabia. However, disparities among regulatory authorities such as the lack of guidelines for biosimilars in rheumatology affect healthcare providers' perceptions, leading to hesitancy in switching from reference products to biosimilars. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of Saudi healthcare professionals regarding biosimilars. Methods: A convenience sample of 87 participants (75 pharmacists and 12 physicians) was analyzed. The data were collected between December 2022 and February 2023. A logistic regression model was used to predict the intention toward biosimilars. Results: Years of practice among physicians significantly influenced their intention to prescribe biosimilars. Positive correlations were also observed between intentions towards prescription and beliefs regarding the safety and efficacy of biosimilars. Pharmacists' authority and knowledge of biosimilars correlated with their intention to substitute or dispense them. However, the logistic regression analysis indicated that behavioral, normative, and control beliefs were not significant predictors of the intention to prescribe or substitute biosimilars in either group. Conclusions: Highlighting the significance of continuing education and coordinating efforts in the international harmonization of biosimilar guidelines, as well as education for healthcare professionals, is required for addressing clinical concerns and enhancing confidence in biosimilars.",

Several prominent clinical data-sharing platforms require researchers to submit formal research proposals before granting data access, providing an opportunity to evaluate how published analyses compare with initially proposed aims. We evaluated the concordance between the included trials, study objectives, endpoints, and statistical methods specified in researchers' clinical trial data use request proposals to four clinical data-sharing platforms and their corresponding publications.MethodsWe identified all unique data request proposals with at least one corresponding peer-reviewed publication as of 31 March 2023 on four prominent clinical trial data sharing request platforms (Vivli, ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com, the Yale Open Data Access Project, and Supporting Open Access to Researchers-Bristol Myers Squibb). When data requests had multiple publications, we treated each publication-request pair as a unit. For each pair, the trials requested and analyzed were classified as fully concordant, discordant, or unclear, whereas the study objectives, primary and secondary endpoints, and statistical methods were classified as fully concordant, partially concordant, discordant, or unclear. For Vivli, ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com, and Supporting Open Access to Researchers-Bristol Myers Squibb, endpoints of publication-request pairs were not compared because the data request proposals on these platforms do not consistently report this information.ResultsOf 117 Vivli publication-request pairs, 76 (65.0%) were fully concordant for the trials requested and analyzed, 61 (52.1%) for study objectives, and 57 (48.7%) for statistical methods; 35 (29.9%) pairs were fully concordant across the 3 characteristics reported by all platforms.

        "AbstractText": "RAC1 is a small 21 kDa RHO GTPase that plays a pivotal role in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics and cell growth. Alterations in the activity of RAC1 are implicated in a range of diseases, including cancer. Increased RAC1 activity, due to overexpression and/or activating mutations, drives transcriptional upregulation, reactive oxygen species production, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, membrane ruffling, and uncontrolled cell proliferation, which are hallmarks of an oncogenic phenotype. While RAC1-activating mutations alone do not appear sufficient to transform cells, their combination with other common mutations, such as BRAF, NRAS, or NF1, have been linked to drug resistance and significantly worsen patient prognosis and hinder treatment responses. The precise mechanisms underlying drug resistance, and the regulation of RAC1 splicing remain poorly understood. RAC1 is a challenging therapeutic target due to its ubiquitous presence and essential cellular functions. To date, there are no established standard treatments for cancers that harbour an additional RAC1 mutation or for RAC1-mediated drug resistance. Current experimental strategies aim to target RAC1 localization, its activators (e.g. guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and downstream effectors. Regulating RAC1 expression by targeting epigenetic regulators, and direct targeting of RAC1 itself, may also be possible in the near future.",

Viewing Neoplasia as an evolutionary engine provides a scientific basis for reexamining the disease cancer. Once the embryo is understood as a benign tumor with a pivotal role in the evolution of all animal forms, there will be an immediate paradigm shift in the search for cancer cure, potentially revealing insights that may be buried within the great developmental transitions of metazoans. This article discusses one of the unifying principles between embryology and oncology, namely cancer stem cells. Some considerations are also provided on the central role of physics and biomechanics in the assembly of the first embryo, which can be regarded as a differentiated benign tumor. Mechanical impregnation of the nucleus of a stem cell, culminating in a totipotent/multipotent cell, was a major event safeguarding the success of embryogenesis throughout evolution. Germ cells in the earliest ctenophore embryos underwent delayed differentiation, subsequent to the mechanical assembly of the embryo. Finally, a discussion is presented on the concept that cancer and embryogenesis (cancer and healthy stem cells) are two sides of the same coin, that is, of the same process. The only difference is that cancer stem cells reveal themselves in inappropriate contexts. Neoplasia is a free force, whereas cancer is a force contained by animal organization.",

        "AbstractText": "Bone cells contribute to tumour metastasis by producing biochemical factors that stimulate tumour cell homing and proliferation, but also by resorbing bone matrix (osteolysis) that releases further stimulatory factors for tumour growth in a vicious cycle. Changes in the local mechanical environment of bone tissue occur during early metastasis, which might activate mechanobiological responses by resident bone cells (osteocytes) to activate resorption (osteoclasts) and thereby contribute to tumour invasion. The objective of this study is to investigate whether bone osteolysis is driven by early changes in the bone mechanical environment during metastasis by (a) implementing subject-specific FE models of metastatic femora to predict the mechanical environment within bone tissue during early metastasis (3-weeks after tumour inoculation) and then (b) applying mechanoregulation theory to predict bone tissue remodelling as a function of the evolving mechanical environment within bone tissue during breast cancer-bone metastasis. We implemented a global resorption rate derived from an experimental model, but the mechanoregulation algorithm predicted localised bone loss in the greater trochanter region, the same region where osteolysis was prevalent after three weeks of metastasis development in the animal model. Moreover, the mechanical environment evolved in a similar manner to that reported in separate subject-specific finite element models of these same animals by 6 weeks. Thus, we propose that early changes in the physical environment of bone tissue during metastasis may elicit mechanobiological cues for bone cells and activate later osteolytic bone destruction.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Adjuvant endocrine therapy is a key treatment in oestrogen receptor positive early breast cancer (BC). For premenopausal women, ovarian function suppression (OFS) in combination with either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) is utilised in high-risk cases. The resultant suppression of circulating oestradiol from OFS could have adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects, subsequently increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search of online databases was conducted to identify randomised control trials involving OFS which reported cardiovascular and metabolic adverse events. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Four studies with a total of 7808 participants were included in the analysis. Tamoxifen alone carries a lower risk of hypertension compared with tamoxifen plus OFS (4.81% vs. 7.57%, OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.49-0.91; p = 0.01). The tamoxifen alone group showed a lower risk of hyperglycaemia compared to tamoxifen with OFS (0.10% vs. 0.86%, OR = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02-0.85, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the potential cardio-metabolic impact of endocrine therapy and OFS on premenopausal women with BC. It also highlights the pressing need for standardisation of routine collection and recording of cardiometabolic history and risk factors as part of baseline assessment and adverse event reporting to better understand the cardiometabolic impact these treatments have on our patients. Further studies, with particular focus on baseline and subsequent development of cardiovascular risk factors, are needed to explore the impact of these drugs on the cardiovascular health of young women with BC.",

This study was designed to study the role of the SP1/SNHG16/GLUT1 axis in prostate cancer (PCa) via modulation of glucose metabolism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The expression profile of SNHG16 in PCa tissues was obtained from the online public database GEPIA (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/). Human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145, were used in this study. Real-time qPCR was employed to determine the mRNA expression levels of SNHG16 and GLUT1. To assess cellular proliferation, CCK-8 assays were performed. Cellular invasion was evaluated using Transwell assays, and glycolysis was monitored through glucose uptake, lactate production, and ATP generation measurements. RESULTS: Analysis of GEPIA2 data revealed upregulation of SNHG16 in PCa tissues and a positive association between GLUT1 (SLC2A1) and SP1/SNHG16 expression in the correlation study. Consistently, SPI and SNHG16 were either overexpressed or knocked down in PCa cells to reveal the role of the SP1/SNHG16/GLUT1 axis. The results demonstrated that PC-3 and DU145 cell proliferation was promoted by the overexpression of either SPI or SNHG16. On the other hand, PC-3 and DU145 cell proliferation was reduced upon knockdown of SP1 or SNHG16. A real-time qPCR study revealed that GLUT1 mRNA was upregulated by SP1/SNHG16 overexpression and downregulated by SP1/SNHG16 knockdown. In PCa cells, overexpression of SNHG16/SP1 resulted in enhanced utilization of glucose, lactose, and ATP production, whereas SNHG16/SP1 knockdown had the reverse effect. Lastly, Transwell assay results showed that overexpression of SNHG16/SP1 promoted, while knockdown of SNHG16/SP1 inhibited, the invasiveness of PC-3 and DU145 PCa cells. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the evidence indicates that the SP1/SNHG16/GLUT1 axis regulates proliferation of PCa cells via the glycolytic route and thus may act as a therapeutic target for PCa treatment.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched five engines, and pre-prints until October 10, 2022, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating \u03b2-blockers for anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity in breast cancer and lymphoma patients. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter (LVEDD, LVESD), peak E' velocity, E/A ratio, E/e' ratio, and NT-pro BNP levels. The secondary outcome was heart rate. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed, and we used GRADE methods to assess quality of evidence (QoE). RESULTS: Twelve RCTs were selected (n = 1,794). Seven RCTs evaluated carvedilol. Mean ages were 39 to 52 years; 88.5% were women; 79.4% had breast cancer, and 11.5% lymphoma. The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of \u03b2-blockers on all-cause mortality (RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.37, 12 RCTs, I 2 = 0%, very low QoE), LVEF (MD = 2.73%, 95% CI: -0.45% to 5.92%, 12 RCTs, I 2 = 93%, very low QoE), and heart rate (MD = -9.14 bpm, 95% CI: -15.02 to -3.26, two RCTs, I 2 = 87%, very low QoE) vs. controls. \u03b2-blockers likely reduced NT-pro BNP levels slightly (MD = -15.35 pg/ml, 95% CI: -22.39 to -8.31, two RCTs, I 2 = 0%, moderate QoE).

Herein, a library of antigen/adjuvant-free liposomes with variable surface charges has been developed and it has been found that highly anionic liposomes show promising adjuvant effects for boosting immune responses. The anionic liposome mobilizes the MyD88 pathways of dendritic cells (DCs) to activate T helper cells and CD8+ T cells. The anionic liposomes enhance host immunity by regulating the population of Th1, Th2 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), and boost adaptive CD8+ T cells in lymphoid organs with good biosafety. It shows the most efficient protection against MC38 colorectal cancer in mice after a parallel injection of antigens and anionic liposomes.

Here, we summarize our recent work on the protective role of alternative autophagy against UVB-induced NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome activation in human keratinocytes. We found that UVB radiation induces ATG5/ATG7-independent alternative (noncanonical) autophagy, which leads to suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation through the clearance of damaged mitochondria in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes. Our findings indicate that ATG5/ATG7-independent alternative autophagy, rather than conventional autophagy, may play a key role in mitigating inflammatory responses, and restoring skin homeostasis after UV radiation.",

In our recent study, we explored the impact and underlying mechanisms of inhibiting the kinase activity of VPS34, a key lipid kinase in the autophagy/endosomal trafficking system, on the expression of CCL5 and CXCL10 in preclinical cancer mouse models. Using NanoString gene expression technology, we analyzed tumors from mice treated with the VPS34 inhibitor SB02024 and demonstrated that the expression of CCL5 and CXCL10 is increased through a cGAS-STING-dependent mechanism within cancer cells. In vitro, both pharmacological inhibition and genetic targeting of VPS34 enhance cGAS-STING-mediated expression and secretion of CCL5 and CXCL10 across various tumor cell types. In vivo, treatment with the VPS34 inhibitor SB02024 enhances the positive effects of the STING agonist ADU-S100 in melanoma tumor-bearing mice.

        "AbstractText": "Olaparib has been approved as a treatment for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in patients with BRCA1 (BRCA1 DNA repair associated) or BRCA2 mutations. However, a large portion of pancreatic cancer patients either exhibit inherent resistance or develop resistance over time. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive this resistance is crucial to develop more effective targeted therapies. In this study, we found that NLRP4 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 4) upregulation is associated with increased resistance to olaparib in pancreatic cancer. In addition, NLRP4 plays a role in both the DNA damage response (DDR) and autophagy. Specifically, NLRP4 enhances DNA repair capacity and leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and autophagy upon olaparib treatment. Notably, NLRP4-generated mitochondrial ROS promote autophagy without directly impacting DNA damage. Inhibition of either mitochondrial ROS production with MitoQ or autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) could sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to olaparib. These findings emphasize NLRP4's role in promoting both autophagy and DNA repair in response to olaparib, suggesting that patients with low NLRP4 expression might respond more favorably to olaparib treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Autophagy has been associated with responses to chemotherapies in several types of cancer, highlighting its contribution to the development of resistance to treatments. Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common tumors and is known for its ability to develop resistance to treatments. Doxorubicin (DXR) is a drug commonly used in BC and known to damage mitochondria. Thus, we thought to investigate if DXR treatment induces mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy specifically degrading mitochondria, in BC cells. By performing a global analysis of mitophagy-associated genes, we found a relationship between their expressions and DXR treatment. We revealed that PINK1/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy is induced following DXR treatment in different cellular BC models, such as the luminal subtype A cell line MCF7 and in the triple-negative BC cell line MDA-MB-231. By Interfering the E3 ubiquitin ligase PARKIN using miR-218-5p, we showed the efficacy in specifically targeting mitophagy in the treatment of BC. Indeed, PARKIN depletion improves cancer cells sensitivity to DXR treatment in vitro, in both stem-like and non-stem-like BC cells. Our approach, which combines two tumoricidal methods, mitophagy inhibition and chemotherapy, could therefore represent a new strategy for BC treatment.

        "AbstractText": "Much is still unknown about microautophagy and its regulators. In our recent paper, one such regulator of microautophagy, the lipid kinase PIKfyve, is described. Previously it was found that treating cells with agents like lysomotropic drugs or proton ionophores, which alter lysosomal osmotic potential and pH, leads to a form of microautophagy that selectively degrades transmembrane proteins. Induction of this type of microautophagy is linked to a lysosomal stress response that involves the targeting of macroautophagy proteins, like ATG8s, to the lysosome membrane, through a mechanism called CASM. We found that CASM-induced microautophagy turns over ATG8s and other lysosomal membrane proteins, and requires PIKfyve activity functioning downstream of ATG8 lipidation. The lysosome biogenesis transcription factor TFEB is induced in parallel to microautophagy, in a CASM-dependent, but PIKfyve-independent manner. These findings demonstrate that stressors that engage CASM cause selective turnover by microautophagy that is coordinated with lysosome biogenesis through a mechanism that is separable through PIKfyve.",

        "AbstractText": "Prostate cancer (PCa) continues to rank among the most common malignancies in Europe and North America with significant mortality rates despite advancements in detection and treatment. Physical activity is often recommended to PCa patients due to its benefits in preventing disease recurrence and managing treatment-related side effects. However, physical activity may be challenging for elderly or bedridden patients. As such, vibration therapy has been proposed as a safe, effective, and easy to perform alternative treatment that may confer similar effects as physical exercise. Specifically, low-magnitude high frequency (LMHF) vibration has been shown to decrease breast cancer extravasation into the bone and reduce other types of cancer proliferation by impacting cell viability. Here, we investigated the effects of daily application of LMHF vibration (0.3\u00a0\u200bg, 60\u00a0\u200bHz, 1\u00a0\u200bhour/day for 3 days) on prostate cancer growth and bone metastasis in vitro. Our findings suggest that LMHF vibration significantly reduces colony formation through a decrease in cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, using a 3D cell culture model, LMHF vibration significantly reduces PC3 spheroid size. Additionally, LMHF vibration reduces PCa cell extravasation into the bone microenvironment through the stimulation of osteocytes and subsequent osteocyte-endothelial cell cross talk. These findings highlight the potential of LMHF vibration for managing PCa growth and metastasis.",

        "AbstractText": "The field of cancer research is increasingly recognizing the complex interplay between biomechanics and tumor epigenetics. Biomechanics plays a significant role in the occurrence, development, and metastasis of cancer and may exert influence by impacting the epigenetic modifications of tumors. In this review, we investigate a spectrum of biomechanical tools, including computational models, measurement instruments, and in vitro simulations. These tools not only assist in deciphering the mechanisms behind these epigenetic changes but also provide novel methods for characterizing tumors, which are significant for diagnosis and treatment. Finally, we discuss the potential of new therapies that target the biomechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment. There is hope that by altering factors such as the stiffness of the extracellular matrix or interfering with mechano-sensing pathways, we can halt tumor progression through epigenetic mechanisms. We emphasize the necessity for multidisciplinary efforts to integrate biomechanics with tumor epigenetics more comprehensively. Such collaboration is anticipated to advance therapeutic strategies and enhance our understanding of cancer biology, signaling the dawn of a new era in cancer treatment and research.",

Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer, due to diagnosis at late stages of the disease and increased resistance to chemotherapies for recurrent disease. Understanding how the tumor microenvironment (TME) interacts with biomechanical forces to drive changes to ovarian cancer cell behaviors could elucidate novel treatment strategies for this patient population. Additionally, limitations in current preclinical models of the ovarian TME do not permit investigation of crosstalk between signaling pathways and mechanical forces. Our study focused on uncovering how strains and hyaluronic acid (HA) interact to signal through the CD44 receptor to alter ovarian cancer cell growth, migration, and response to a commonly used chemotherapy, paclitaxel. Using an advanced 3D in vitro model, we were able to identify how interactions of strain and HA as in the TME synergistically drive enhanced proliferation and migration in an ovarian tumor model line, while decreasing response to paclitaxel treatment. This study demonstrates the importance of elucidating how the mechanical forces present in the ovarian TME drive disease progression and response to treatment.",

This study evaluated early myocardial dysfunction using two-dimensional (2D) speckle tracking echocardiography in breast cancer patients treated with anthracyclines. METHODOLOGY: Sixty-two patients with anthracycline na\u00efve breast cancer and 62 controls were studied. All patients were treated with standard regimens containing epirubicin. Echocardiography was done at three time points (baseline, one month and three months). Left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain were measured. RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 47.6\u00b110.46 years, obesity was the most common co-morbidity (27.4%) followed by hypertension (14.5%). Over the three month-follow-up period, the left atrial volume increased from 21.4\u00b16.90mls/m2 at baseline to 24.8\u00b16.38mls/m2, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 62.4\u00b19.35% at baseline to 54.8\u00b17.22%, and the average left ventricular global longitudinal strain decreased from -19.0\u00b15.91% at baseline to -16.1\u00b13.70% by three month-follow-up. The percentage change in GLS at one month was 15.98% compared to 4.06% change in ejection fraction at one month follow-up. Thirty-five patients (56.5%) developed cardiotoxicity; however, no significant predictor of cardiotoxicity was noted. CONCLUSION: This study showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain, and increased left atrial volume over a period of three months in breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. It also confirms the usefulness of speckle tracking echocardiography in evaluating breast cancer patients pre-, intra-, and post-chemotherapy.",

These complications are often not prioritized in clinical practice, particularly in resource-limited settings like Nigeria. However, they impact patients' quality of life and overall treatment outcomes This study determined the prevalence and types of chemotherapy-induced oral changes, the relationship between chemotherapeutic agents and oral changes, and the associated risk factors. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study with a convenience sampling method was designed at the Department of Oral Medicine and Oral Pathology, Obafemi Awolowo University, Osun State, Nigeria. The oral cavity of 82 patients aged 6 years and above who received cancer chemotherapy at the Paediatric Medicine, Haematology, and Surgical Units of the hospital were examined for pathologies associated with chemotherapy. RESULTS: Dysgeusia was present in 60 (73.17%), oral pain in 47 (57.32%), and oral mucositis (OM) in 44 (53.66%). Forty-two (95.45%) of the total 44 (100%) persons with OM complained of oral pain (p < 0.001), 41 (93.18%) had dysgeusia (p < 0.001), and 31 (70.45%) had fungal infection (p = 0.002).

        "AbstractText": "KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer. In multiple types of cancer, a missense mutation at codon 12 substitutes a glycine for a cysteine, causing hyperactivation of the GTPase and enhanced MAPK signalling. Recent drug discovery efforts culminating from work during the past decade have resulted in two FDA-approved inhibitors, sotorasib and adagrasib, which target the KRASG12C mutant allele. Ongoing medicinal chemistry efforts across academia and industry have continued developing more potent and efficacious KRASG12C inhibitors. One agent in late-stage clinical trials, divarasib, has demonstrated robust overall response rates, in some cases greater than currently approved agents. Divarasib also exhibits enhanced covalent target engagement in vitro and significant specificity for KRASG12C, yet the structural details of its binding have not been published. Here we report a high-resolution crystal structure of cysteine-light KRAS-4BG12C in complex with divarasib. Though it binds in the same allosteric pocket as sotorasib and adagrasib, the switch-II loop in each crystal structure takes on a distinct conformation differing as much as 5.6 \u00c5 between the C\u03b1 atom of residue 65 with sotorasib.

Role of risk reduction salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is well established among these women. Surgical ovarian ablation also plays role in hormone positive breast cancers in prolonging their survival by permanent hormone suppression. The role of oophorectomy has different impacts in breast cancer. METHODOLOGY: The study aimed to determine the different indications for oophorectomy and their histologies among premenopausal breast cancer women. This was a prospective cross sectional study of breast cancer women diagnosed \u2264\u200950\u00a0years of age. All these women underwent genetic counselling, gynaecology examination, transvaginal scan &CA 125 testing. Surgery was offered to women with BRCA mutations (RRSO) and also for hormone receptor positive women (surgical ovarian ablation). Histopathologies of these women were analysed using SEE-FIM protocol. RESULTS: A total of 98 breast cancer women were identified. The median age was 41.5\u00a0years (SD 5.7) & median CA 125 was 9.3 (IQR 6-20.5). The genetic acceptance rate was 18%. Four patients were germline BRCA 1/2 positive, 1 VUS, 13 negative and 80 didn't opt for test. Ultrasound imaging showed cystic ovaries among 12 patients. Most of them had benign features. Twenty two patients underwent surgery (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy)-3 BRCA positive and rest for hormone positive breast cancer. Histopathologies were normal except for Krukenberg's mets in one hormone positive breast cancer patient. CONCLUSION: The incidence of germline mutations in our study was 5%. STIC lesions were not detected in our study, attributing to low acceptance of genetic testing. The value of screening for ovarian cancer was limited.

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Bcl-2-associated athanogene-3 (BAG-3) is a cytoplasmic multidomain protein member that belongs to the BAG family of co-chaperones that are known to be involved in several cellular processes, including control of apoptosis, autophagy, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Normal tissues show weak to negligible expression as it is downregulated. However, its expression is upregulated in various epithelial and hematological malignancies, including endometrial, cervical, and chronic lymphoid leukemia. It plays a vital role in tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and therapy resistance; thus, its expression has been determined to be a valuable tool in developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Endometrial cancers are one of the most common female genital tract malignancies with high mortality. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the BAG-3 protein immunoexpression in 33 cases of endometrial cancer and correlated its expression with prognostic determiners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of BAG-3 immunoexpression in 33 cases of endometrial carcinoma. Cytoplasmic and membranous staining was considered positive and its correlations with prognostic factors such as myometrial invasion, LVSI, and ovarian involvement were analyzed. RESULTS: BAG-3 immunopositivity was seen in 31 (93.9%) cases and two cases were found to be negative. Twenty-two (66.6%) showed strong (3\u2009+) intensity, seven (21.2%) showed moderate, and two (6.1%) showed weak BAG-3 immunostaining. No significant correlation was seen between grade and intensity.

        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Currently, there is scanty data regarding patients specifically with stage IV epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) as many reports combine analysis with patients staged IIIC. Our objective was to understand the survival outcome in stage IV EOC\u00a0patients treated with curative intent. METHODS: Data of 895 patients were retrospectively reviewed from the medical records department from the period of January 2014 to December 2018 at Malabar Cancer Centre in India. Patients with stage IV disease were selected for further analysis. Five-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were examined. RESULTS: There were a total of 60 patients with stage IV EOC of which only 41 who underwent primary/interval cytoreductive surgery and 11 underwent only chemotherapy. The median follow-up period was 71\u00a0months. The overall survival (OS) rates at 2, 3, and 5\u00a0years were 69.2%, 47.9%, and 22.5%, respectively. The median OS was 34.5\u00a0months (95% CI 18.17-50.82), and median RFS was 12\u00a0months (95% CI 10.3-13.7). Patients not operated had worse overall survival compared to those who went surgical debulking (p\u2009<\u20090.013). Ascites (HR 0.383 95% CI 0.16-0.88) and optimal cytoreduction (HR 3.004 95% CI 1.20-7.50) were the only variables found to be significant predictors of overall survival. CONCLUSION: Distant metastasis to visceral organs should not be a deterrent for surgeons to achieve curative intent of treatment in stage IV epithelial ovarian cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The presence of metastatic peritoneal nodules in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is considered a prognostic factor of both overall survival and disease-free survival. The goal of this study is to assess the potential prognostic effect of associated peritoneal carcinomatosis and PCI in stage II and III EOC patients after undergoing complete cytoreduction (CC score 0 or 1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study including 50 high-grade serous EOC cases treated and followed up from 2012 and 2016. Twenty-three cases had peritoneal nodules at the time of exploration. PCI was assessed intraoperatively in each case. Twenty-seven cases had no peritoneal nodules (were given PCI 0). RESULTS: The presence of peritoneal nodules, presence of ascites, and stage of the disease had statistically significant impact on overall survival, but with multivariate analysis, only presence of peritoneal nodules was associated with a statistically significant reduced overall survival (HR 6.192; 95% CI 1.248-30.720; P value 0.026). The presence of peritoneal nodules was associated with a statistically significant higher incidence of postoperative death (P value 0.038). PCI had no statistically significant impact on overall survival, disease-free survival, or incidence of postoperative death (within 30\u00a0days after surgery). CONCLUSION: The presence of peritoneal nodules had a statistically significant impact on overall survival and incidence of postoperative death. There was no statistically significant prognostic impact of PCI in stage II and III EOC patients who had complete cytoreduction.",

        "AbstractText": "AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the clinical-pathological profile of gynaecological malignancies occurring as a second cancer and identify their modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective cohort study included women operated for gynaecological carcinoma following a previous treated malignancy, in the gynaecologic oncology department of a tertiary care hospital, between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2021. Demographic details, clinical and pathological characteristics of the current malignancy and previous malignancy were obtained from medical records and analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: During this period, 2370 women with gynaecological malignancies were operated, of whom 27 (1.1%) patients had gynaecological malignancy as a second malignancy. This included 19 (70.3%) endometrial and 8 (29.6%) ovarian cancer patients following a median period of 48 (24-144\u00a0months) from the index malignancy. Their median age and BMI were 60\u00a0years (37-67) and 27 (17-39.1), respectively. Endometrioid endometrial cancer was most common and was preceded by breast carcinoma in 19 (70.37%) and colorectal in 5 (18.5%). Four patients had previous microsatellite unstable colorectal cancer. Two patients were found to have mismatch repair deficient endometrial cancer on somatic testing. High-grade serous carcinoma was the most common ovarian histology and was preceded by breast cancer in 6 (75%). Four patients underwent germline testing, and one was found to have a (breast cancer gene) BRCA pathogenic mutation. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer and colon cancer can precede gynaecologic cancer. Individualization of somatic and genetic testing in colorectal and breast cancers will allow screening and prevention of second gynaecologic malignancies.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is a prevalent gynecological malignancy typically characterized by abnormal uterine bleeding in postmenopausal women, although it can also manifest in asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic postmenopausal women often display endometrial thickening, and research has shown associations between endometrial thicknesses of 5\u00a0mm or more and certain pathologies. However, it remains unclear whether specific pathologies are related to different diameters of thickened endometrium. AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the diameters of endometrial thickness its histopathology, and the related symptoms in postmenopausal women who have incidental endometrial thickening and are not experiencing vaginal bleeding. METHODS: This study was conducted in Alzahra Teaching Hospital of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. The inclusion criteria for the study comprised of postmenopausal women who had visited the clinics with symptoms other than vaginal bleeding and exhibited an endometrial thickness of more than 5\u00a0mm in ultrasound imaging. A total of eighty-four women were included in the final analysis. The participants were scheduled to undergo a Pap smear and endometrial biopsy (Pipelle biopsy). The histopathology of the endometrial samples was examined to test the research hypothesis. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant association between endometrial histopathologic findings and endometrial diameter (p-value\u2009=\u20090.12) or participants' chief complaints (p-value\u2009=\u20090.21). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that endometrial thickening is not a reliable predictor for a specific endometrial pathology in postmenopausal women who do not experience vaginal bleeding.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: According to previous reports, EUS-fine-needle biopsy (FNB) with or without rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) showed the nonsuperiority of EUS-FNB + ROSE over EUS-FNB. However, previous studies included various kinds of FNB needle. This might be a critical limitation due to heterogeneity. Therefore, the aim of the present multicenter, randomized controlled trial was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the fork-tip needle with or without ROSE for pancreatic lesions. METHODS: In the ROSE group, if an adequate sample was obtained to diagnose by on-site evaluation, EUS-FNB was stopped. If cytological results were insufficient or indeterminate, EUS-FNB was repeated. In the macroscopic on-site evaluation (MOSE) group, if a 4-mm length of visible core tissue was obtained, EUS-FNB was finished. If visible core tissue was not obtained or was less than 4 mm in length, a second puncture was attempted. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-one patients were randomized, 85 to the ROSE group and 86 to the MOSE group. In the MOSE group, diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy were 94.4% and 91.8%, respectively, for visible core tissue and 80.6% and 70.0%, respectively, for red tissue. Finally, overall diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy were 97.1% and 95.3%, respectively, in the ROSE group and 95.8% and 95.3%, respectively, in the MOSE group. Although there were no significant differences regarding adverse events between groups, the mean number of punctures was significantly lower in the MOSE group than in the ROSE group (1.47 vs. 1.20, P = 0.0171). CONCLUSIONS: EUS-FNB using a fork-tip needle for pancreatic lesions has high diagnostic yield even without ROSE.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There are two different endoscopic ultrasonographic manifestations of gastric signet ring cell carcinoma (GSRCC). No studies have been reported on the differences in the clinical profiles of patients based on EUS examination. We aim to study the variations in clinicopathological characteristics between two distinct endoscopic ultrasonographic manifestations of GSRCC. METHODS: A total of 302 patients with GSRCC confirmed by pathological examination who underwent EUS were enrolled in the study. Based on the endoscopic ultrasonographic features, patients were categorized into two groups: type 1, where the entire layer structure disappeared, and type 2, where the layer structure was still present and appeared lymphomatoid. Clinicopathologic features were collected retrospectively and analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with type 2 patients, type 1 patients tended to develop GSRCC at an older age (P = 0.033) and had higher serum levels of tumor markers and were more likely to experience anemia (P < 0.001) and weight loss (P < 0.001) during the disease progression. Significant increases in the tumor size (P < 0.001), thickness of the affected gastric wall (P < 0.001), and depth of tumor invasion (P < 0.001) were observed in type 1 patients. Furthermore, type 1 patients had higher prevalence of affected blood vessels (P < 0.001), nerves (P < 0.001), lymph nodes (P < 0.001), and peritoneal metastasis (P < 0.001). However, no difference was found in the duration of disease between the two groups, and all deficient mismatch repairs were observed in type 1 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The two distinct endoscopic ultrasonographic manifestations of GSRCC exhibited different clinicopathological characteristics, suggesting that they may represent different subtypes of the disease that require special attention in management strategies.",

This work aims to develop a deep learning (DL)-based image-guide framework to enable fast volumetric image reconstruction for accurate target localization for treating lung cancer patients with gating, and it is presented in the context of FLASH which leverages ultra-high dose-rate radiation to enhance the sparing of organs at risk without compromising tumor control probability. The proposed framework comprises four modules, including orthogonal kV x-ray projection acquisition, DL-based volumetric image generation, image quality analyses, and proton water equivalent thickness (WET) evaluation. We investigated volumetric image reconstruction using kV projection pairs with four different source angles. Thirty patients with lung targets were identified from an institutional database, each patient having a four-dimensional computed tomography (CT) dataset with ten respiratory phases. Considering all evaluation metrics, the kV projections with source angles of 135\u00b0 and 225\u00b0 yielded the optimal volumetric images. The patient-averaged mean absolute error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index measure, and WET error were 75\u00b122 HU, 19\u00b13.7 dB, 0.938\u00b10.044, and -1.3%\u00b14.1%.

AIM: To evaluate plasma trace elements in female patients with cancer of breast- or cervix. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was carried out in the Departments of Immunology and Radiation Oncology, University of Ibadan, Nigeria. Thirty (30) patients with cervical cancer, 30 patients with breast cancer and 30 age-matched females without cancer as control were included in the study. Plasma separated from venous blood was analysed for the concentrations of zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), selenium (Se) and copper (Cu) using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). The sixty cancer patients were newly diagnosed and in a stable state. RESULTS: The mean plasma levels of Fe and Cu were significantly reduced in patients with breast cancer- or cervical cancer compared with control. The plasma concentrations of Fe, Cu, Zn and Se were significantly reduced in all patients having breast cancer and those in stage 2 compared with cervical cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Available data further support a previous suggestion that blood levels of metal varies with different cancers. Thus, a need for differential supplementation based on cancer types when modulation of trace element levels becomes a therapeutic option.",

        "AbstractText": "Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid models offer a more physiologically relevant and complex environment compared to traditional two-dimensional cultures, making them a promising tool for studying tumor biology and drug response. However, these models often face challenges in real-time monitoring of drug diffusion, penetration, and target engagement, limiting their predictive power for in vivo and clinical outcomes. This study introduces a novel approach for real-time tracking of drug permeability using small molecule drugs with GFP/RFP-disrupting properties that correlate with their efficacy. We developed a reproducible 3D spheroid model with various cancer cell lines expressing GFP/RFP for efficient drug screening. Through screening over 20 FDA-approved enzyme inhibitors, we identified three covalent kinase inhibitors-osimertinib, afatinib, and neratinib-that irreversibly disrupt GFP and RFP fluorescence. Our results reveal distinct drug diffusion and penetration profiles within GFP/RFP-expressing spheroids, varying with drug concentration and formulation, and correlating with clinical volume of distribution (Vd) values. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach is useful for evaluating different drug formulations as well as screening penetration enhancers for solid tumors. These findings offer a valuable 3D model for studying kinetics of drug permeability and efficacy in tumor-like environments, with potential implications for drug delivery research and formulation development.",

METHODS: In total, 114 patients with BC performed 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. Patients were randomly assigned to a training set (n\u2009=\u200979, 55 cases of Ki67\u2009+\u2009and 24 cases of Ki67-) and a validation set (n\u2009=\u200935, 24 cases of Ki67\u2009+\u2009and 11 cases of Ki67-). Thirteen clinical characteristics and 704 radiomics features were extracted, and 4 clinical and 8 radiomics features were selected. Three models were developed, including the clinical model, the radiomics model, and the combined model. Model performance was evaluated using the ROC curve, and clinical utility was assessed through decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: The N stage, tumor morphology, SUVmax, and the longest diameter significantly differed between Ki67\u2009+\u2009and Ki67- groups (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Eight radiomics features were selected for the radiomics model. The area under the curve of the combined model in the training and test group was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82\u223c0.97) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.64\u223c0.99), respectively. The combined model significantly outperformed both the radiomics model and the clinical model alone (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The DCA curve demonstrated the superior clinical utility of the combined model compared to the clinical model and radiomics model. CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT image-based radiomics features combined with clinical features have the potential to predict Ki67 expression in BC.

        "AbstractText": "AIMS: We previously reported no change in surgical outcomes for laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) and laparoscopic low anterior resection (LLAR) early in the COVID-19 pandemic (2020), although the number of elective surgeries decreased. In 2021, COVID-19 spread further, with vaccination and other medical measures based on several medical societies' guidelines being initiated. Using the Japanese National Clinical Database (NCD), we added 2022 data to the 2018-2021 data to analyze the impacts of expansion of the COVID-19 infection and its spread on laparoscopic surgery (including robot-assisted surgery). METHODS: Data on patients who underwent LDG and LLAR for cancer were extracted from the NCD between 2018 and 2022. The numbers of LDG and LLAR were obtained, and morbidity and mortality rates were evaluated using a standardized morbidity/mortality ratio (SMR), i.e. the ratio of the observed number of incidences to expected number of incidences calculated by the risk calculator previously developed by the NCD. RESULTS: The numbers of LDG and LLAR cases declined in 2020, the first pandemic year, and continued to decline in 2022 to the same level as 2021, but with no further decline and no recovery trend in the number of cases. Numbers of robot-assisted LDG and LLAR cases increased but at a rate lower than the prepandemic increase. Mortality and anastomotic leakage, two very important complications assessed in SMR, did not worsen during the pandemic compared to prepandemic levels. CONCLUSION: In Japan, laparoscopic surgery was safe and unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, even in 2022, when the epidemic spread.",

Herein, we developed a body component score (BCS) to comprehensively evaluate total body composition in patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer (CRC) and examined its relationship with long-term prognosis. METHODS: This retrospective study included 300 patients with CRC who underwent curative colorectal resection in 2010-2019. The BCS included skeletal muscle index (SMI), subcutaneous fat area (SFA), visceral fat area (VFA), fatty liver, and pancreatic fatty replacement, measured by preoperative computed tomography. The BCS was calculated as the sum of each score from 0 to 5; patients were grouped into low (score 0-1), medium (score 2-3), and high (score 4-5) BCS. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models assessed disease-free (DFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in these patients. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that T3 or T4 tumors (p\u2009=\u20090.038), pathological stage III (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and low BCS [p\u2009=\u20090.016; hazard ratio (HR), 1.95; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-3.35] were independently associated with DFS, whereas pathological stage III (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and low BCS (p\u2009=\u20090.001; HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.57-6.27) were independent prognostic factors for CSS. Patients with a low BCS had significantly worse DFS (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and CSS (p\u2009<\u20090.001), according to the log-rank test for trends.

METHODS: Data of patients who underwent elective LAR for rectal cancer between 2018 and 2022 were obtained from the National Clinical Database of Japan. Hospitals were categorized into high-, medium-, and low-volume groups. Each group was constituted to represent approximately one-third of all surgeries performed between 2018 and 2019. The standardized morbidity/mortality ratios (SMRs) of Clavien-Dindo grade \u22653 (CD\u2009\u2265\u20093) complications were the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included anastomotic leakage, pneumonia, and surgical mortality. RESULTS: This study analyzed 91\u2009800 cases of elective LAR, with 10.5% experiencing CD\u2009\u2265\u20093 complications, 8.8% anastomotic leakage, 0.9% pneumonia, and 0.5% surgical mortality. Despite COVID-19, SMRs of CD\u2009\u2265\u20093 complications decreased from 2018 to 2022 across all groups. However, increases in the rates and SMRs of CD\u2009\u2265\u20093 complications were observed in low-volume hospitals around mid-2020, followed by a decline. Anastomotic leakage showed similar trends. The rates and SMRs of pneumonia and surgical mortality remained unchanged. Notably, anastomotic leakage rates were 7.6%, 8.9%, and 10.0% in high-, medium-, and low-volume hospitals, respectively, indicating superior outcomes in high-volume hospitals. CONCLUSION: Early COVID-19 waves may have disproportionately affected low-volume hospitals. However, the decline in SMRs of CD\u2009\u2265\u20093 complications from 2018 to 2022 across all three groups suggests the robustness and resilience of surgical services for rectal cancer in Japan.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent rectal surgery for primary rectal cancer between December 2011 and April 2021. We identified urinary dysfunction risk factors and examined the effect of autonomic nervous system resection extent on urinary dysfunction occurrence, with urinary dysfunction defined as a residual urine volume of >50\u2009mL. Urinary dysfunction with no improvement over 1\u2009y was defined as permanent urinary dysfunction. RESULTS: Of 1017 eligible patients, 78 (7.7%) required autonomic nervous system resection. Lateral lymph node dissection was performed in 357 patients (35.1%). Urinary dysfunction was observed in 102 patients (10.0%). We studied 32 (41.0%) of 78 patients who underwent autonomic nervous system resection and 82 (23.0%) of 357 patients who underwent lateral lymph node dissection presented with urinary dysfunction. Multivariate analysis revealed that lateral lymph node dissection and autonomic nervous system resection were significant predictors of urinary dysfunction. The urinary dysfunction incidence was notably higher in patients with autonomic nervous system unilateral total resection of at least one side than in those with bilateral preservation (65.4% vs. 28.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.01), and permanent urinary dysfunction exclusively occurred in these patients. CONCLUSION: In robotic surgery, autonomic nervous system resection and lateral lymph node dissection were independent risk factors for urinary dysfunction.

The PGG had significantly better adjusted OS (13.8 vs. 10.0\u2009mo; IPTW HR: 0.66; p\u2009=\u20090.01) and adjusted PFS (4.3 vs. 3.2\u2009mo; IPTW HR: 0.71; p\u2009=\u20090.027) than the NGG. No significant differences were observed in ORR and DCR. The incidence of Grade 3 or worse adverse events did not differ between the two groups except for a high incidence of anemia and diarrhea in the NGG. CONCLUSION: Patients with previous gastrectomy are expected to have better survival outcomes when receiving second-line irinotecan (IRI)-based chemotherapy for AGC.",

        "AbstractText": "AIM: Sarcopenia is associated with poor postoperative outcomes in various cancers; however, limited evidence is available for rectal cancer. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of skeletal muscle mass on the short- and long-term outcomes of rectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 787 Stage I-IV rectal cancer patients who underwent curative resection between 2003 and 2021 at The University of Tokyo Hospital were included. We conducted a propensity score-matched analysis to mitigate confounding bias. The third lumber psoas muscle mass was measured to define sarcopenia. RESULTS: Among 787 patients, 350 (44.5%) were classified as having sarcopenia. After matching, 532 patients were analyzed. Patient characteristics in the sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups were similar; however, the body mass index differed. The sarcopenia group had significantly higher rates of postoperative complications of all grades (33.1% vs 24.8%; p\u2009=\u20090.035), of grade \u22652 (29.3% vs 21.8%; p\u2009=\u20090.047), and anastomotic leakage (1.9% vs 0%; p\u2009=\u20090.0082) than the nonsarcopenia group. The 5-y overall survival rate was significantly lower in the sarcopenia group than in the nonsarcopenia group (85.3% vs 91.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.019). Disease-free survival was similar between the groups (p\u2009=\u20090.40). In the total cohort analysis, sarcopenia was an independent risk factor for total postoperative complications (odds ratio 1.41, p\u2009=\u20090.042).

METHODS: A Japanese medical claims database was used to identify patients who had gastroenterological cancer surgery from 2011 to 2022. Patients were divided into groups based on the surgical sites, and postoperative feeding routes and timing of initiation of oral intake for groups were assessed. For the subset of patients fasting postoperatively for \u22657\u2009d, the proportion of patients prescribed target doses of energy (20\u2009kcal/kg) and amino acids (0.8\u2009g/kg) on postoperative d 7 were assessed. RESULTS: Surgical sites of 360\u2009296 study patients were: esophagus, 14\u2009784; stomach, 103\u2009339; colon/rectum, 194\u2009049; liver, 19\u2009277; gallbladder/bile duct, 8279; pancreas, 20\u2009568. The median postoperative day of oral intake initiation was: esophagus, seven; stomach and pancreas, four; colon/rectum and gallbladder/bile duct, three; liver, two. The proportions of fasting patients prescribed target doses of energy and amino acids on postoperative d 7 were: esophagus, 42.6% and 34.4%; stomach, 21.8% and 28.0%; colon/rectum, 20.9% and 29.1%; liver, 21.2% and 22.5%; gallbladder/bile duct, 31.0% and 33.4%; pancreas, 28.2% and 37.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Oral intake after gastroenterological cancer surgery was started earliest in patients undergoing liver surgery and latest in patients undergoing esophageal surgery. Target parenteral energy and amino acid doses were prescribed to less than half of fasting patients. Education is needed to promote early initiation of oral intake and the use of guidelines-based parenteral nutrition dosing in patients after gastroenterological cancer surgery.",

This study aimed to evaluate the combined role of frailty and sarcopenia in predicting postoperative complications in older adults with hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer undergoing surgery. METHODS: This retrospective study included 107 Japanese patients who underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) at the geriatric oncology service before cancer treatment decisions and subsequent curative surgery for hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer. Frailty status was measured using the validated 10-item frailty index based on a CGA (FI-CGA-10) and categorized as fit, prefrail, or frail. Sarcopenia was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis and grip strength. The primary outcome was postoperative complications, defined as Clavien-Dindo grade\u2009\u2265\u2009III, within 1\u2009month of surgery. RESULTS: The median age of the 107 patients was 79 (range, 75-89) years. Patients were categorized as fit (n\u2009=\u200936, 33.7%), prefrail (n\u2009=\u200957, 53.2%), or frail (n\u2009=\u200914, 13.1%). Of these, 21 patients (20%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia; 16 patients (15%) experienced postoperative complications. Patients classified as prefrail or frail had a higher incidence of postoperative complications compared with those classified as fit (19.7% vs. 5.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.08). Patients with both prefrail or frail and sarcopenia had a significantly higher risk of postoperative complications.

        "AbstractText": "AIMS: The incidence of postoperative chronic liver failure (PCLF) after major hepatectomy for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma is relatively low, but it warrants careful attention. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors for PCLF, with a specific focus on the correlation with postoperative changes in liver and spleen volumes. METHODS: A total of 172 patients who underwent major hepatectomy for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma between 2006 and 2021 were included in the study. PCLF is defined as the presence of liver failure, such as ascites, esophageal varices, encephalopathy, and jaundice at 3\u2009mo postoperatively. Risk factors, including chronological changes in liver volume, spleen volume, and hepatospleno volume ratio for PCLF, were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: PCLF occurred in 8 of the 172 patients. On univariate analysis, multiple factors including preoperative prealbumin levels, indocyanine green retention test, and future remnant liver volume were identified as risk factors for PCLF. On multivariate analysis, the hepatospleno volume ratio (p\u2009=\u20090.033) and prealbumin level (p\u2009=\u20090.015) 3\u2009mo after surgery were significantly associated with PCLF. The cutoff value for the hepatospleno volume ratio was 3.0 (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.881, sensitivity: 91.7%, specificity: 66.7%) and that for prealbumin level was 10\u2009mg/dL (AUC: 0.894, sensitivity: 83.3%, specificity: 88.9%). CONCLUSION: Hepatospleno volume ratio <3.0 and prealbumin level <10\u2009mg/dL 3\u2009mo after surgery were identified as risk factors for PCLF, implying the importance of postoperative nutritional guidance to preserve the remnant liver function for patients with these risk factors.",

Additionally, the short-term outcomes of MTG compared to open total gastrectomy (OTG) for locally advanced gastric cancer have yet to be demonstrated. METHODS: We retrospectively compared short-term outcomes between MTG and OTG for locally advanced gastric and esophago-gastric junctional cancer, performed at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo, during the period from January 2017 to March 2024. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: In total, 359 patients were included, with 190 remaining after PSM, resulting in 95 in each group. The MTG group experienced a significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo classification (C-D) \u22653 than the OTG group (3.2% vs. 11.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.026). Moreover, the rate of postoperative intra-abdominal infectious complications (IAIC) was significantly lower in the MTG than in the OTG group (C-D\u2009\u2265\u20092; 7.4% vs. 17.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.029 and C-D\u2009\u2265\u20093; 2.1% vs. 9.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.030, respectively).

METHODS: A total of 1086 patients diagnosed with UAC between 1980 and 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Data were collected through the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum project. The patients were divided into two groups: 248 elderly patients in the E-UAC group and 838 nonelderly patients in the NE-UAC group. Patients aged >65\u2009y at cancer diagnosis were considered elderly. RESULTS: The recurrence rate did not differ between the two groups. Segmental resection was the only common independent risk factor for recurrence in both the E-UAC and the NE-UAC groups. The E-UAC patients had significantly better 5-y disease-specific survival (DSS) than the NE-UAC patients (94.7% vs 91.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.04). There were no differences in 5-y recurrence-free survival (RFS; 89.3% vs 86.6%, respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.24) or overall survival (OS; 88.8% vs 89.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.50). The E-UAC patients who underwent segmental resection had poorer RFS than those who underwent total proctocolectomy, but there were no significant differences in DSS or OS. CONCLUSION: Despite the elevated risk of cancer recurrence observed in the UAC patients who underwent segmental resection in both the E-UAC the NE-UAC groups, our findings suggested that segmental resection may be a viable alternative to total proctocolectomy in terms of survival rate for the E-UAC patients.",

However, it remains unclear whether surgical volumes and medical resource use have recovered postpandemic. This study examines pre- and postpandemic trends in upper gastrointestinal surgeries, including esophagectomy and gastrectomy, and their short-term outcomes. METHODS: Data from the Japan's National Clinical Database (NCD) were analyzed for patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer and gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 2018 and December 2023. We evaluated changes in surgical volume, intensive care unit (ICU) use, morbidity, mortality rates, and the standardized morbidity and mortality ratio (SMR)-a comparison of observed versus expected outcomes using an NCD-established risk calculator. Key metrics included 30d mortality, surgical mortality, and four major morbidities like pneumonia and anastomotic leakage. RESULTS: Esophagectomy volumes remained stable from 2018 to 2023, while gastrectomy volumes decreased notably over the past 6\u2009y. The proportion of patients over 70 increased significantly in both surgery types. Morbidity and mortality rates showed no significant deterioration postpandemic, as indicated by SMR values. CONCLUSIONS: This study analyzed changes in surgical volume and short-term outcomes for upper gastrointestinal cancer in the post-COVID-19 era using a Japanese nationwide database.

Patients with severe urinary incontinence are most commonly treated with artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) placement. AIM: To evaluate the functional results of AUS implantation in patients with severe urinary incontinence at long-term follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2023, the AUS was implanted in 62 patients with severe stress urinary incontinence. Urinary losses were assessed using a bladder diary. No need to use pads or use of no more than 1 safety pad per day (\"social continence\") was considered a success, while use of no more than 2 pads, or a reduction in urine loss of more than 50% was regarded as an improvement. RESULTS: The mean patient age at the time of AUS implantation was 67.4+/-8 years. Urinary incontinence was most often a complication of radical prostatectomy (61.3%). A history of radiation therapy, previous treatment of urethral stricture, and surgical procedures for urinary incontinence were noted in 14.5%, 48.4%, and 19.4% of patients, respectively. The median follow-up was 73.5 months (IQR 14.8-118.3 months). There was a significant decrease in median urine loss from 900 mL (IQR 700-1100 mL) to 7 mL (IQR 0-35 mL; p<0.05), and a decrease in the number of pads used per day from 7 (IQR 6-8) to 1 (IQR 0-2; p<0.05). The criterion for successful implantation was met in 69.4% of patients, while 43.5% of patients did not use pads. According to the correlation analysis, concomitant diabetes mellitus, history of radiation therapy, surgical treatment of the urethral stricture or urinary incontinence did not have any significant effect on functional results. In addition, there were no cases of AUS revision.

AIM: To evaluate the safety and efficiency of PCA of RCC (cT1a) under ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) guidance, as well as overall, disease-free and cancer-specific survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After receiving approval from the local ethics committee, a total of 59 patients with RCC was undergone to PCI at the Institute of Urology and Human Reproductive Health of the First Moscow State Medical University named after I.M. Sechenov. In the period from 2015 to 2017, PCI under ultrasound guidance was performed in 27 patients. The average age of the patients was 66 years (48-83), the average tumor size was 29 mm (14-36). The Charlson comorbidity index was 7 (5-10). In the period from 2018 to 2022, PCI for RCC was performed in 32 patients. The average age was 68 years (46-89), while the average tumor size was 24 mm (8-38). The Charlson comorbidity index was 7 (4-12). The study included patients with histologically confirmed RCC with a tumor size of up to 4 cm. RESULTS: There were four recurrences diagnosed by ultrasound. Two patients underwent repeated PCI, while in the remaining cases laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was done. Six-year overall, disease-free and cancer-specific survival was 96%, 85% and 100%, respectively. On CT, four relapses were diagnosed. Repeat PCI was done in two patients, and laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was performed in other two cases. In one patient, intraoperative bleeding was noted during the insertion of cryoneedles, due to which the procedure was aborted. Bleeding was stopped conservatively. Three- overall, disease-free and cancer-specific survival was 97%, 88% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PCI under ultrasound and CT guidance showed comparable efficacy in the treatment of RCC, however, to reduce the radiation dose, it is reasonable to use a combination of imaging methods.",

        "AbstractText": "AIM: to explore the development of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on deep learning (DL) neural networks aimed at minimizing human error in PI-RADS grading and supporting medical decision-making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included a cohort of 136 patients, comprising 108 cases of PCa (PI-RADS score 4-5) and 28 cases of benign conditions (PI-RADS score 1-2). The 3D U-Net architecture was applied to process T2-weighted images (T2W), diffusion-weighted images (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced images (DCE). Statistical analysis was conducted using Python libraries to assess diagnostic performance, including sensitivity, specificity, Dice similarity coefficients, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The DL-CAD system achieved an average accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 60%, and specificity of 84% for detecting lesions in the prostate. The Dice similarity coefficient for prostate segmentation was 0.71, and the AUC was 81.16%. The system demonstrated high specificity in reducing false-positive results, which, after further optimization, could help minimize unnecessary biopsies and overtreatment. CONCLUSION: The DL-CAD system shows potential in supporting clinical decision-making for patients with clinically significant PCa by improving diagnostic accuracy, particularly in minimizing intra- and inter-observer variability. Despite its high specificity, improvements in sensitivity and segmentation accuracy are needed, which could be achieved by using larger datasets and advanced deep learning techniques. Further multicenter validation is required for accelerated integration of this system into clinical practice.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Glioma surgery aims to maximize tumor removal while preserving functional integrity. Functional outcome usually focuses on neurological and neurocognitive functions, but surgery may also affect mood regulation. We determined the occurrence of depressive symptoms after surgery and investigated associated factors, including preoperative depressive symptoms and the location of the resection. METHODS: We included a single-center retrospective cohort of patients with supratentorial diffuse glioma (WHO grade 2-4) who underwent first-time surgical resection between 2009 and 2021 and who completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) before and one year after surgery. Resection cavities were segmented on postoperative MRI scans. White matter disconnections were computed, the so-called disconnectome, to examine distant effects. Multivariable regression analysis was used to relate patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics to postoperative depression scores and changes after surgery. Lesion-symptom mapping was used to relate resection and disconnectome locations to these scores and changes. RESULTS: The study included 83 patients. Before surgery, 25% of patients had depressive symptoms and one year after surgery 34%, which was not statistically different. Resections of gliomas in the right hemisphere were significantly associated with increased depression scores after surgery. A resection involving the left anterior temporal region was significantly associated with low postoperative depression scores. Disconnectome locations were not associated with either postoperative or change in depression scores. CONCLUSIONS: Resection locations affect depressive symptoms in glioma patients. This information may be useful for patient counseling.",

We performed a bilateral R-RPLDN in a 33-year-old man with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors and residual postchemotherapy masses. For this approach, the patient was placed in a steep Trendelenburg position, and a 5-port transperitoneal technique was used, with the robot docked so that the arms were oriented cephalad. This approach allowed simultaneous access to both sides of the retroperitoneum, thereby eliminating the need for bilateral lymphadenectomy and patient repositioning. Bilateral R-RPLDN was performed using a single-position supine approach. This versatile approach offers a less invasive, more efficient, and safer solution for removing residual postchemotherapy testicular cancer masses.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Sinonasal lesions are common benign masses with overlapping clinical and histopathological features. Extracellular matrix proteins such as periostin, fibronectin, and tenascin-C play key roles in tissue remodeling and inflammation, yet their distinct expression profiles in these lesions remain poorly defined. AIM: This study aimed to compare the immunohistochemical staining patterns of periostin, fibronectin, and tenascin-C in sinonasal lesions to elucidate their roles in pathogenesis and enhance differential diagnosis. METHODS: In this retrospective study, pathological specimens from 70 patients who underwent surgery for sinonasal polyps were analyzed. Immunohistochemical expression of periostin, fibronectin, and tenascin-C was assessed separately in epithelial and stromal compartments using a semi-quantitative scoring system. Associations between staining patterns and lesion types were evaluated using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: The cohort had a male-to-female ratio of 5:2 with a mean age of approximately 40 years. Nasal polyps demonstrated significantly higher stromal periostin staining compared to both antrochoanal polyps and inverted papillomas. Conversely, antrochoanal polyps exhibited significantly elevated epithelial periostin expression relative to inverted papillomas. Fibronectin expression was markedly increased in nasal polyps, especially in the stroma, supporting its role in inflammatory tissue remodeling. Tenascin-C expression did not differ significantly among the lesion types. CONCLUSION: Differential expression of periostin and fibronectin suggests distinct pathogenic mechanisms in sinonasal lesions. The compartment-specific staining patterns of periostin, along with the prominent fibronectin expression in nasal polyps, suggest these biomarkers could serve as valuable diagnostic tools and potential therapeutic targets. Further research is needed to explore these pathways in sinonasal disease management.",

        "AbstractText": "Penile cancer accounts for about 1% of all male cancer diagnoses in the United States. Regional lymph node involvement is strongly correlated with overall outcomes, and as such the procedure of inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) is imperative to the diagnostic and oncologic outcomes for these patients. The current gold standard of open ILND presents challenges in mitigating detrimental postoperative sequalae such as wound complications and lymphedema, without compromising oncologic outcomes. There has been a growing interest and shift in minimally invasive (MIS) approaches to tackle the challenges seen in the open approach to ILND. Several different minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopic video-endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy (VEIL) and robotic-assisted VEIL approaches have been explored and described in the literature. A systematic literature search of PubMed and Medline (OVID) literature review was performed to assess outcomes in MIS approaches to ILND in comparison to traditional open approach. Key words included penile cancer/penile neoplasms, minimally-invasive procedures, robotics, video-endoscopic, robotic-assisted, inguinal lymphadenectomy, and inguinal lymph node dissections. Studies show that MIS approaches to ILND have potential to reduce high-grade postoperative complications, operative time, and hospital stay while ensuring oncologic outcomes. Despite the learning curve associated with MIS ILND, preliminary data does suggest favorable outcomes. Prospective, randomized trials are needed to reveal the full benefit of MIS ILND compared to open ILND.",

METHODS: We utilized two legal documents from the Health and Retirement Study survey: a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare (DPOAH). We established the baseline trends from 2014 to assess if trends in 2024 have improved upon future data availability. Logistic regression models were fitted with outcome variables (living will, DPOAH, and both) stratified by cognition levels (dementia/impaired cognition versus normal cognition). RESULTS: Age, ethnicity, race, education, and rurality were significant predictors of ACP (having a living will, DPOAH, and both the living will and DPOAH) across cognition levels. Participants who were younger, Hispanic, black, less educated, or resided in rural areas were less likely to complete ACP. CONCLUSION: Examining ACP and its linkages to specific social determinants is crucial for understanding disparities and developing effective educational and interventional strategies to enhance ACP uptake among diverse population groups. Future studies are needed to assess whether disparities have improved over the last decade, particularly as 2024 data become available.

Unlike traditional small-molecule inhibitors, PROTACs leverage the cell's natural protein degradation machinery to selectively degrade pathogenic proteins, offering significant therapeutic potential for previously undruggable targets and complex diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the regulatory landscape governing their approval is crucial as their development accelerates. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of recent patents, regulatory considerations, emerging concerns, and future perspectives of PROTACs in cancer management. EXPERT OPINION: From a regulatory perspective, PROTACs present unique challenges and opportunities. Their dual-functional nature requires a nuanced approach to classification and approval, blending small-molecule and biologic regulatory frameworks. Specific guidelines addressing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are needed. Comprehensive preclinical evaluation and robust clinical trial designs are essential to manage off-target effects and immunogenic responses. The collaboration between regulatory bodies, academia, and industry is crucial for establishing a clear pathway for PROTAC approval.

        "ArticleTitle": "Interpretation and Strategy to Resolve Neuromonitoring Changes Associated With Brain Sag.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) aides in safe maximal resection of brain tumors in eloquent areas. During the resection of large or deep-seated tumors, shifts in the peri-resectional parenchyma and cortical surface relative to cranial electrodes, or brain sag, can cause false-positive loss of sensorimotor signals. We describe patterns of electrophysiological changes associated with brain sag and a facile technique to rapidly resolve these changes intraoperatively by saline infusion. METHODS: We reviewed cases operated on by the senior author and identified cases where brain sag was noted intraoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative imaging, operative details, and IONM electrophysiological traces were analyzed to surmise generalizable patterns. RESULTS: We observe stepwise decreases in somatosensory-evoked potentials and transcranial motor-evoked potentials that occur with removal of a large intraparenchymal mass or after significant loss of cerebrospinal fluid. The pattern of upper extremity or lower extremity signal change depends on the location of the lesion and the positioning of the head, depending on which regions of the motor or somatosensory cortices are most affected by brain sag. Recovery of the somatosensory-evoked potentials and transcranial motor-evoked potentials during saline infusion into the resection cavity or ventricle, which reconstitutes the cortical topography, suggests that the IONM signal change was artifactual, rather than reflecting true physiological injury. We present 6 illustrative cases that highlight distinct patterns of electrophysiological change associated with brain sag and the extent of signal restoration. CONCLUSION: Brain sag is commonly encountered during the resection of large or deep-seated tumors. Improved understanding of the spatiotemporal electrophysiological signatures of brain sag and application of the saline infusion technique to reverse false-positive drops in neuromonitoring signals improves the utility of IONM and enhances safe resection.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Cancer, next to cardiovascular diseases, remains the primary concern of modern medicine in developed countries. Despite the unprecedented progress in targeted therapies and personalised medicine, including immunotherapy and gene therapy, we are still unable to efficiently treat many malignancies. One of the major obstacles to treating cancer is its ability to metastasise. Hence, a better understanding of cancer biology with emphasis on the metastasis formation may hold the key to further ameliorating cancer treatment. Nowadays, there is a growing body of evidence for the common denominator of neoplasia, which seems to be universal - cancer stem cells which are being found in a growing number of cancers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a Web of Science and Medline database search using the terms \"cancer stem cells\", \"carcinogenesis\", and \"stem cells\" in conjunction with \"metastasis\", without setting time limits. RESULTS: The existence of cancer stem cells was proven both in animal models and in humans. We know beyond doubt that cancer stem cells may be found in bladder cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer, among others. The cancer stem cells in the aforementioned cancers may initiate tumour formation ex vivo and thus theoretically lead to tumour recurrence. Their role in the formation of metastases, however, is still under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Although their exact role is yet to be identified, it is now obvious that cancer stem cells give rise to primary mass in solid tumours and differentiated cancer cells in leukaemias. However, the role of cancer stem cells in metastasis is still obscure.",

Moreover, the impact of these complications is not well qualified. The primary purpose of this study is to qualify complications after RC and quantify rates of emergency department (ED) utilisation and readmissions to the hospital. The secondary purpose is to associate risk factors for ED visits and hospital readmission. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were retrospectively analysed, who underwent RC for bladder cancer. ED visits within 90 days of discharge from RC and readmission at both 30 and 31-90 days of discharge were collected. Complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo system and classified using the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center complication system. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-six patients were included. The in-house complication rate before discharge was 36%, and the 90-day complication rate after discharge was 54.8%. 33.7% of patients had \u22651 ED visit postoperatively, 18.7% were readmitted within 30 days, and 17.3% within 31-90 days of discharge. The primary reason for ED presentation, readmission at 30 and 31-90 days was infection. Cutaneous ureterostomy (CU) was associated with greater likelihood of presentation to the ED and readmission 31-90 days postoperatively (p <0.01). Overall survival (OS) was worse in patients who presented to the ED and/or were readmitted at both the 30- and 31-90-day marks (p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: ED utilisation and readmission rates after RC are high. The most common complication is infection. Patients with a CU are at higher risk for healthcare utilisation. OS is worse in patients with an ED visit or readmission to the hospital, and these patients may require closer monitoring.",

Magnetite selenium (  Fe 3 O 4 - Se  ) nanocomposite was prepared by co-precipitation method followed by characterization using TEM, EDX, FTIR, VSM, and XRD. The average size of the nanomaterial was found to be 20 nm with a low polydispersity index of 0.2. The biosensor was fabricated by immobilizing a single-stranded DNA probe specific to miRNA-21 onto the  Fe 3 O 4 - Se  nanocomposite modified electrode surface. At the working electrode/electrolyte interface, the binding of the DNA probe results in decreased charge transfer impedance. The developed magnetite-based impedimetric biosensor demonstrated a linear variation of resistance to charge transfer with miRNA-21 concentration (75 zM to 0.751 pM).

Serine/threonine kinase 39 (STK39) was reported to play an essential role in ion homeostasis. However, its potential role and mechanism in viral infection remain unknown. In this study, we found that viral infection promoted STK39 expression. Consequently, overexpressed STK39 inhibited the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the production of type I interferon, which led to viral replication and immune escape. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of STK39 significantly protected mice from viral infection. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation assays identified that STK39 interacted with PPP2R1A (a scaffold subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)) in a kinase activity-dependent manner. This interaction inhibited DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 1 (DCAF1)-mediated PPP2R1A degradation, maintained the stabilization and phosphatase activity of PP2A, which, in turn, suppressed the phosphorylation of IRF3, decreased the production of type I interferon, and then strengthened viral replication. Thus, our study provides a novel theoretical basis for viral immune escape, and STK39 may be a potential therapeutic target for viral infectious diseases.",

The bioactive NPFeS/GD exhibited controlled release of GSDMD plasmid, H2S, and Fe2+ in response to the tumor microenvironment. Fe2+, H2S, and the expression of GSDMD protein could effectively elicit highly immunogenic PANoptosis and ferroptosis. Furthermore, releasing H2S could mitigate the overexpression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase1 (IDO1) induced by immunogenic PANoptotic and ferroptotic cell death and disrupt the activity of IDO1. Consequently, NPFeS/GD effectively triggered the antitumor innate and adaptive immune responses through induction of PANoptotic and ferroptotic cell death and reshaped the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment to enhance antitumor immunotherapy for metastasis inhibition. This study unveiled the significant potential of immunogenic PANoptosis and ferroptosis in H2S gas therapy for enhancing tumor immunotherapy, offering novel insights and ideas for the rational design of nanomedicine to enhance tumor immunogenicity while reprogramming the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Intravenous delivery of STING agonists using acid-sensitive polycationic polymer-modified lipid nanoparticles for enhanced tumor immunotherapy.",
        "AbstractText": "Although cancer immunotherapy has made great strides in the clinic, it is still hindered by the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME). The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway which can modulate TIME effectively has emerged as a promising therapeutic recently. However, the delivery of most STING agonists, specifically cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), is performed intratumorally due to their insufficient pharmacological properties, such as weak permeability across cell membranes and vulnerability to nuclease degradation. To expand the clinical applicability of CDNs, a novel pH-sensitive polycationic polymer-modified lipid nanoparticle (LNP-B) system was developed for intravenous delivery of CDNs. LNP-B significantly extended the circulation of CDNs and enhanced the accumulation of CDNs within the tumor, spleen, and tumor-draining lymph nodes compared with free CDNs thereby triggering the STING pathway of dendritic cells and repolarizing pro-tumor macrophages. These events subsequently gave rise to potent anti-tumor immune reactions and substantial inhibition of tumors in CT26 colon cancer-bearing mouse models. In addition, due to the acid-sensitive property of the polycationic polymer, the delivery system of LNP-B was more biocompatible and safer compared with lipid nanoparticles formulated with an indissociable cationic DOTAP (LNP-D). These findings suggest that LNP-B has great potential in the intravenous delivery of CDNs for tumor immunotherapy.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Inflammation Promotes Aging-Associated Oncogenesis in the Lung.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world. While cigarette smoking is the major preventable factor for cancers in general and lung cancer in particular, old age is also a major risk factor. Aging-related chronic, low-level inflammation, termed inflammaging, has been widely documented; however, it remains unclear how inflammaging contributes to increased lung cancer incidence. AIM: The aim of this study was to establish connections between aging-associated changes in the lungs and cancer risk. METHODS: We analyzed public databases of gene expression for normal and cancerous human lungs and used mouse models to understand which changes were dependent on inflammation, as well as to assess the impact on oncogenesis. RESULTS: Analyses of GTEx and TCGA databases comparing gene expression profiles from normal lungs, lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma of subjects across age groups revealed upregulated pathways such as inflammatory response, TNFA signaling via NF\u03baB, and interferon-gamma response. Similar pathways were identified comparing the gene expression profiles of young and old mouse lungs. Transgenic expression of alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT) partially reverses increases in markers of aging-associated inflammation and immune deregulation. Using an orthotopic model of lung cancer using cells derived from EML4-ALK fusion-induced adenomas, we demonstrated an increased tumor outgrowth in lungs of old mice while NLRP3 knockout in old mice decreased tumor volumes, suggesting that inflammation contributes to increased lung cancer development in aging organisms. CONCLUSIONS: These studies reveal how expression of an anti-inflammatory mediator (AAT) can reduce some but not all aging-associated changes in mRNA and protein expression in the lungs. We further show that aging is associated with increased tumor outgrowth in the lungs, which may relate to an increased inflammatory microenvironment.",

        "AbstractText": "As local regions in the tumor outstrip their oxygen supply, hypoxia can develop, affecting not only the cancer cells, but also other cells in the microenvironment, including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Hypoxia is also not necessarily stable over time, and can fluctuate or oscillate. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 is the master regulator of cellular response to hypoxia, and can also exhibit oscillations in its activity. To understand how stable, and fluctuating hypoxia influence breast CAFs, we measured changes in gene expression in CAFs in normoxia, hypoxia, and oscillatory hypoxia, as well as measured change in their capacity to resist, or assist breast cancer invasion. We show that hypoxia has a profound effect on breast CAFs causing activation of key pathways associated with fibroblast activation, but reduce myofibroblast activation and traction force generation. We also found that oscillatory hypoxia, while expectedly resulted in a \"sub-hypoxic\" response in gene expression, it resulted in specific activation of pathways associated with actin polymerization and actomyosin maturation. Using traction force microscopy, and a nanopatterned stromal invasion assay, we show that oscillatory hypoxia increases contractile force generation vs stable hypoxia, and increases heterogeneity in force generation response, while also additively enhancing invasibility of CAFs to MDA-MB-231 invasion. Our data show that stable and unstable hypoxia can regulate many mechnobiological characteristics of CAFs, and can contribute to transformation of CAFs to assist cancer dissemination and onset of metastasis.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Cost-Utility Analysis of Trastuzumab-Emtansine Versus Trastuzumab for the Treatment of Residual Invasive HER-2-Positive Breast Cancer in Iran.",
        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women, and its incidence is increasing in Iran. HER-2-positive breast cancer is invasive and often associated with poorer outcomes. Patients with this type of breast cancer can develop resistance to medications like trastuzumab. Trastuzumab-emtansine (TDM1) is a medication developed to reduce cancer cell resistance to trastuzumab. The TDM1 has been shown to decrease the incidence of death and recurrence in breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility and calculate the budget impact of TDM1 versus trastuzumab for the treatment of residual invasive HER-2-positive breast cancer. METHODS: A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed, incorporating four health states. Women aged 45 with residual invasive HER-2-positive breast cancer entered the model. The study adopted a healthcare system perspective, with costs reported in 2021 US dollars. Discount rates of 7% for costs and 3% for utility values were applied. Utility values and transition probabilities were derived from published literature. Costs were estimated based on guidelines, expert opinions, and Iranian tariffs. Iran's pharmacoeconomic threshold of 1085$ was used for comparison. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and budget impact of TDM1 were calculated, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The model indicated that treatment with TDM1 resulted in a 1.59 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) increase, with an additional cost of 1408$. This was deemed cost-effective, considering Iran's pharmacoeconomic threshold of 1085$ (calculated ICER: 886$ per QALY gained). One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the model was sensitive to the costs of TDM1 and trastuzumab, the discount rates for utility values and costs, and the probability of achieving invasive disease-free survival (IDFS). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that 59.61% of simulations fell below Iran's pharmacoeconomic threshold, supporting the model's robustness. The budget impact analysis revealed that the additional budget required for TDM1 treatment over a three-year period was 1,120,546$ compared to trastuzumab. CONCLUSIONS: Although TDM1 imposes higher costs, it is more cost-effective than trastuzumab for the treatment of residual invasive HER-2-positive breast cancer in Iran.",

Researchers are exploring alternative treatments that target cancer cells with high selectivity and minimal side effects. Photothermal therapy has shown promise as one such treatment option. OBJECTIVES: Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) can penetrate cellular membranes and convert near-infrared light into heat for photothermal therapy (PTT). METHODS: In a recent study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used in combination with PTT to treat HT29 and PCL/PRF/5 cancerous cells for different durations (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours). The cytotoxicity of each treatment was evaluated through MTT assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) analysis, lipid peroxidation, lysosomal membrane integrity, and protein carbonyl analysis. RESULTS: The study found that SWCNTs, MWCNTs, and PTT each individually had a significant cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. However, when used together, they were even more effective in destroying cancer cells. Combining SWCNTs with PTT resulted in the highest level of cytotoxicity.

Although discoveries related to the potential anticancer effects of bee venom are increasing, the unstable nature of venom biomolecules remains a limiting factor for their usage. In this study, we employed mesoporous silica nanocarriers (MSNs) to provide precise dosing and prevent carriers from biomolecule degradation thanks to the outstanding loading capacity provided by the pores, excellent chemical and biological robustness, and ability to improve bioavailability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MSNs were synthesized and physicochemical characterizations were carried out. The cytotoxicity of Apis mellifera anatoliaca bee venom and venom-complexed MSNs (MSNs@Venom) were determined for the MDA-MB 231, PC3, and HeLa cancer cell lines and the cytotoxicity of pristine MSNs was investigated for the HEK-293 and CCD34-Lu cell lines. The cellular uptake of MSNs@Venom by PC3 and MDA-MB 231 cells was investigated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The apoptotic effect on cancer cells was examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The MSNs exhibited significant cellular uptake of MSN by the PC3 and MDA-MB 231 cell lines, resulting in a 1.5-fold enhancement in the apoptotic effect of venom on the PC3 cell line when combined with MSNs, compared to cells exposed alone to venom. CONCLUSION: MSNs could effectively be taken up by MDA-MB 231 and PC3 cancer cells, enhancing the action of bee venom by the particle-mediated delivery. MSNs@Venom have the potential to offer cost-effective complementary and innovative cancer treatment options.",

AIMS: : The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of an individuation and perspective-taking (IPT) intervention to decrease implicit bias and improve pain treatment clinical decision making in pediatric SCD HCPs. METHODS: This mixed methods pilot randomly assigned HCPs (N = 36) to an intervention (n = 17) or control condition (n = 19). Implicit and explicit bias measures were administered pretreatment and 3 months postintervention. Differences were analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance. HCP ratings of virtual patient vignettes depicting Black and White youth with SCD or cancer pain were used to assess differential clinical decision making based on race and diagnosis and analyzed using hierarchical linear mixed model analysis. Focus groups with intervention participants were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences in scores on bias measures across time, condition, or the Condition \u00d7 Time interaction were found (all P < 0.05). Significant differences in HCP ratings were found between types of HCPs (P < 0.001), but no effects were attributable to condition, time, virtual patient race, or diagnosis. Ten themes were extracted regarding the intervention's format, structure, and content. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate an IPT intervention in pediatric SCD HCPs.

This study was conducted to understand mortality in a large dialysis network of Indian HD patients and attempt to elucidate risk factors for mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study of deaths among patients undergoing HD across 203 centers in India from January 1 to March 31, 2021 with an age-matched control of survivors. We reviewed demographic, dialysis, clinical, and socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: Out of 17,659 patients on dialysis, 554 cases (non-survivors) and 623 age-matched controls (survivors) patients were followed up. The mean age was 54.9 \u00b1 13.8 years, 70.5% (391) of them were males. Gender, BMI, dialysis frequency, HD vintage time, history of diabetes, and heart failure were similar between non-survivors and survivors.

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer subtypes can be categorized based on their gene expression profiles using immunohistochemistry into Luminal A, Luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. However, immunohistochemistry has certain limitations that can lead to misclassification. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification, and changes in the promoter region can alter gene expression and the quantity of functional protein synthesized, disrupting gene function. The aim of this study was to identify DNA methylation biomarkers for subtype classification in breast cancer using microarray and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) methods. DNA samples were extracted, subjected to bisulfite conversion and then used for both the microarray and MSP methods. This study successfully identified differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) as biomarker for each subtype classification of breast cancer: Luminal A (hypermethylation of ADAMTSL2 gene; cg14397888), Luminal B (hypomethylation of ADAMTSL2 gene; cg14397888), HER2+ (hypermethylation of PTPRN2 gene; cg25910261), and TNBC (hypomethylation of LCLATl gene; cg15652532). The DMC biomarker found for the HER2+ subtype, hypermethylation in the PTPRN2 gene (cg25910261), has the potential to be used by healthcare providers to identify HER2+ patients and provide the HER2-targeted therapy to improve the patient's survival. In addition, our developed MSP method could produce an effective diagnostic tool for classifying the Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes, with accuracies of 75% and 76%, respectively.",

Digital health solutions that use machine learning to detect substance use from wearable biosignal data can eventually pave the way for real-time digital interventions. However, difficulties in addressing severe between-subject data heterogeneity have hampered the adaptation of machine learning approaches for substance use detection, necessitating more robust technological solutions. We tested the utility of personalized machine learning using participant-specific convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enhanced with self-supervised learning (SSL) to detect drug use. In a pilot feasibility study, we collected data from 9 participants using Fitbit Charge 5 devices, supplemented by ecological momentary assessments to collect real-time labels of substance use. We implemented a baseline 1D-CNN model with traditional supervised learning and an experimental SSL-enhanced model to improve individualized feature extraction under limited label conditions. Results: Among the 9 participants, we achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score across participants of 0.695 for the supervised CNNs and 0.729 for the SSL models. Strategic selection of an optimal threshold enabled us to optimize either sensitivity or specificity while maintaining reasonable performance for the other metric. Conclusion: These findings suggest that Fitbit data have the potential to enhance substance use monitoring systems. However, the small sample size in this study limits its generalizability to diverse populations, so we call for future research that explores SSL-powered personalization at a larger scale.",

Survivors face complex challenges, and the interplay of these factors affects their recovery. Social support, encompassing emotional, informational, and practical assistance, is pivotal, offering belonging and resilience. Coping strategies, whether adaptive (like problemsolving) or maladaptive (like denial), significantly impact psychological outcomes. Spirituality, irrespective of ties to organized religion, significantly impacts the psychological well-being of breast cancer survivors. It provides a framework for understanding and coping, offering hope and meaning. Psychological status encompasses emotional well-being, mental health, and quality of life, influenced by cancer severity, personality traits, social support, coping strategies, and fear of recurrence. Methodology for literature review: The literature review employed a systematic approach, utilizing various databases and search terms to identify recent research on the relationship between social support, coping strategies, spirituality, and psychological status among breast cancer survivors. Inclusion criteria focused on relevance and rigor, with a thematic emphasis on the interplay between these factors. Both qualitative and quantitative studies from peer-reviewed journals were considered within a specific time frame (2010-2023) to capture recent advancements. The screening process involved two independent reviewers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. Data extraction and synthesis involved carefully analyzing study characteristics, key findings, and implications for survivorship. The analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive overview and identify future research directions. CONCLUSION: Understanding the dynamics of social support, coping strategies, spirituality and psychological status among breast cancer survivors is essential for developing effective interventions and support systems. By addressing and challenging societal attitudes, promoting awareness and education, and fostering supportive environments, Healthcare professionals can help breast cancer survivors overcome they face, enhance their coping mechanisms, bolster their social support networks, and ultimately improve their psychological status.",

PATIENT AND METHOD: This study was conducted to evaluate the most common types of primary tumors that can spread to the brain, methods of diagnosis, treatments, and survival outcomes in 72 patients with brain metastasis from primary solid tumors who were presented and treated in the Mosul oncology hospital between Jan 2018 to 2020 in Nineveh province. RESULTS: Breast and lung primary tumors are the most frequent primaries causing brain metastasis. Imaging studies using MRI & CT scans are more available and accessible for most of the patients. We found that WBRT is the main treatment used. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiotherapy was not available at the time of performing this study. Surgical resections are limited to a minority of our patients. We recommend more studies for each primary tumor focusing on its pathologic and molecular characteristics and its relation to brain metastasis.

        "ArticleTitle": "Open Nephron-Sparing Surgery for Renal Tumors is an Effective Surgical Option for Low HealthResource Settings in the Era of Laparoscopic Surgery.",
        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Open nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is known to have good outcomes in terms of renal function and oncology. Its role in the laparoscopic and robotic surgery era requires further evaluation in low-income countries. This study evaluated the renal function and oncological outcomes of open NSS surgery for renal tumors to provide insight into the future role of open NSS alongside laparoscopic and robotic surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 52 patients who underwent NSS for RCC were included in this study. Clinical data were recorded using a predesigned questionnaire covering epidemiology, patient presentation, comorbidities, laboratory investigation, imaging studies, TNM classification, CTU findings, selection criteria, intra- and postoperative complications, hospital stay, and follow-up outcome data. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, and dependent and independent variables were considered statistically significant at a P-value level <0.05. RESULTS: Of the 52 patients, 44.2% were male, and 55.8% were female, with an average age of 57.5 \u00b1 14.8. Incidental renal masses were observed in 36.5% of patients, while flank pain was observed in 55.8% of patients. The average size was 5.9 \u00b1 1.7 cm. A transcostal extraperitoneal approach was used, with a mean operative time of 87.6 \u00b1 16.2 minutes. The main artery was clamped in 92.3% of the patients, and selective apical artery ligation was performed in one patient under specific conditions. There were no instances of bleeding during or after the surgery, and the typical period of ischemia during tumor removal lasted approximately 12.5 \u00b1 4.8 minutes. Histological results showed malignant tumors in 86.5% of the cases and benign lesions in 13.5%. Positive surgical margins were observed in one patient with a small entophytic upper pole mass of 3.7 cm. The average hospital stay was five days \u00b1 1.6; however, 49 (94.2%) patients had their drain removed in less than three days. Only three (5.8%) patients developed a urinary fistula and responded well to conservative treatment. Of the 52 patients, 21 (40.4%) were monitored for > 5 years, while 31 (59.6%) were observed for less than 5 years. Follow-up CTU analysis showed no evidence of recurrence or metastases, and serum creatinine levels at three months and one year were 1.4 (SD 0.6) and 1.2 (SD 0.7), respectively. The correlation between ischemia time and tumor size was statistically significant (P = 0.034). Moreover, histological type was also significantly correlated with tumor size, with a P-value of 0.000. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The study concluded that open NSS is a secure procedure that maintains renal function without compromising oncological outcomes. A warm ischemia time of 20 min did not compromise oncological outcomes or renal function. Tumor sizes of 7 cm or more can be safely managed. A double-layer suturing technique and follow-up scheme using serum creatinine and CTU at three months and then annually seems practical and applicable even in low-currency income countries.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Survival Outcomes and Predictive Factors to Evaluate the Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation in Carcinoma Esophagus: An Institutional Experience from India.",
        "AbstractText": "Aim & Objectives: Although NCRT (Neoadjuvant Chemo Radiation Therapy) followed by surgery demonstrates an increase in overall survival (OS) in locally advanced operable esophageal cancer, there is a lack of a reliable predictive factor to identify patients who are more likely to be affected by treatment toxicities or natural history of the disease. In this study, we have studied various indices like pre-treatment serum albumin, hemoglobin, Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet to Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), Platelet to Albumin Ratio (PAR), Systemic Immune Index (SII) as independent prognostic factors in esophageal cancer, with respect to the outcomes and tumor response. Material & Methods: A total of 83 patients of esophageal cancer who were treated with Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation from 2016-2021 were evaluated in this study. All the patients were treated with 41.4 Gy / 23 # External Beam Radiation Therapy with concurrent weekly Paclitaxel & Carboplatin (CROSS Protocol). Baseline hematological parameters like PLR, NLR, PAR, SII, Serum Albumin and Hemoglobin were obtained from laboratory records. Survival outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. Chi square test was used to analyze the association with pathological complete response after NCRT. Results: The median follow-up time of the study was 42.50 months, and the median age of patients was 55 years (IQR - 45-63). The majority of the patients were squamous cell carcinoma (92.8%), and 7.2% of the patients were adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Amongst this study group, 41 patients (49.4%) underwent surgery following chemoradiation, the rest of the patients couldn't undergo surgery. Amongst the 41 operated patients, 21 (51.2%) had pathological complete response, 13 (31.7%) had partial response, 7 (17.1%) had poor/no response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The median OS of a group of patients who underwent surgery (44.7 Months) was found to be significantly higher (p<0.001) than that of patients who were not operated (17.8 Months). Kaplan Meir analysis and log-rank test revealed that high pretreatment albumin and hemoglobin had statistically significant association with better OS. High PLR, low NLR, low PAR and high SII had a correlation trend with better OS. However, statistical significance couldn't be demonstrated owing to our smaller sample size. Patients with high PLR (> 180) were found to have a higher rate of pathologic complete response compared to the patients with low PLR (< 180). Conclusion: NCRT when offered to a selected subgroup of patients having operable carcinoma esophagus can give excellent survival outcomes. Patient selection should incorporate factors that look into the biology, systemic inflammatory response and baseline status of these patients. The evaluation of these factors on a larger scale prospective multicentric trials is warranted.",

AIM: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the immunoexpression and interrelationship of cyclin D1 (CD1) and HER2/neu in histopathologically diagnosed cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC) and its association with other clinicopathological parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 120 cases of cervical lesions; out of which 10 cases were of negative for malignancy/dysplasia (NED), 15 cases of CIN I, 9 cases of CIN II and 21 cases of CIN III and 65 cases of invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC). A technique of manual tissue array was employed to study the expression pattern of CD1 and HER2/neu in all the cases. Results were subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: CD1 immunoexpression was statistically significantly higher in normal + LSIL (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) (CIN I) cases than HSIL (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) (CIN II+III) + ICC. As the severity of the cervical lesions increased, CD1 immunoexpression statistically significantly shifted from nucleus to cytoplasm. Statistically significant inverse relationship was noted between CD1 expression and grade of ICC cases. CD1 IHC marker showed 63.64% sensitivity, 0% specificity, 87.5% PPV and 0% NPV. The overall agreement of CD1 staining with H&E diagnosis was 58.33% (\u03ba=0.1538 i.e. poor). HER2/neu immunoexpression increased statistically significantly with increasing severity of lesion from CIN-I to CIN-III to ICC. None of the NED cases in present study showed HER2/neu positivity. With increasing stage and grade of ICC, the percentage of cases expressing HER2/neu statistically significantly increased. Her2/neu IHC marker showed 56.63% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV and 17.24% NPV. The overall agreement of HER2/ neu staining with H&E diagnosis was 60% (\u03ba=0.1771 i.e. poor). The agreement between HER2/neu and CD1 immunostaining was 40%. CONCLUSION: Cyclin D1 and HER2/neu IHC marker panel could be used as prognostic markers and could be routinely incorporated into the surgical pathology report which could aid in understanding the biology of the tumor and better patient management. ICC expressing CD1 and HER2/neu could benefit from specific targeted therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer and foremost cause of death in women. AIM: This study was conducted to study the calretinin expression in BC and its correlation with other clinicopathological parameters such as tumor size, histological grade, lymph node status, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu), Ki67 status and molecular subtypes in Indian setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty cases of BC diagnosed between 2017 and 2019 were included in the study. A technique of manual tissue microarray was employed for the analysis of expression of IHC markers such as calretinin, ER, PR, Her2/neu, Ki67, CK5/6 and EGFR in all cases. Results were subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Calretinin positivity was seen in 66% (33/50) cases of BC of which 45.45% (19/33) were triple negative BC (TNBC) and 21.21% (7/33) were of basal like BC (BLBC) molecular subtype. Calretinin expression was significantly associated with higher grade and negative ER and PR expression. Maximum cases expressing calretinin showed lymphovascular invasion (LVI), positive lymph node status, higher stage, Ki67 and HER2/neu positivity. 38% cases were TNBC. Calretinin was found positive in 78.95% of TNBC cases. Calretinin expression was seen in TNBC cases of higher grade and stage with positive lymph node status, presence of LVI and Ki67 positivity.14% cases were BLBC. Calretinin was found positive in 77.78% of BLBC cases. Calretinin expression was seen in BLBC cases of higher grade and stage with positive lymph node status, Ki67 positivity and presence of LVI. CONCLUSION: Calretinin can be potentially used as a prognostic marker and could be included in routine IHC workup of BC cases which could aid in development of tailored therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in China. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for HCC, but the postoperative recurrence and metastasis rates are high. Current evidence shows that microvascular invasion (MVI) is an independent risk factor for postoperative recurrence and metastasis, but there are still many controversies about the diagnosis, classification, prediction, and treatment of MVI worldwide. METHODS: Systematic literature reviews to identify knowledge gaps and support consensus statements and a modified Delphi method to develop evidence- and expert-based guidelines and finalization of the clinical consensus statements based on recommendations from a panel of experts. RESULTS: After many discussions and revisions, the Chinese Association of Liver Cancer of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association organized domestic experts in related fields to form the \"Chinese expert consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with microvascular invasion (2024 edition)\" which included eight recommendations to better guide the prediction, diagnosis and treatment of HCC patients with MVI. The MVI pathological grading criteria as outlined in the \"Guidelines for Pathological Diagnosis of Primary Liver Cancer\" and the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital (EHBH) nomogram for predicting MVI are highly recommended. CONCLUSIONS: We present an expert consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of MVI and potentially improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) for HCC patients with MVI.",

The present retrospective cohort study examines clinical characteristics, prevalence, and mortality risk across alcoholic intake spectrum in SLD individuals. METHODS: Data between 1999 to 2018 were extracted from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey registries and analysed. Population baseline characteristics were evaluated across classifications of SLD. SLD was confirmed using either fatty liver index (FLI) or United States FLI (US-FLI). Multivariate analyses were used to study mortality-related outcomes. RESULTS: The 20,510 individuals with SLD included were classified into MASLD predominant (69.00%), MetALD (18.77%), and ALD predominant (12.23%) groups. Temporal analysis revealed significant decreases in MASLD prevalence in the SLD population from 1999-2018 in general [average annual percentage change (AAPC) -4.802%, P=0.001], as well as in females, Mexican Americans, and Non-Hispanic Blacks. MetALD prevalence in the SLD population increased from 1999-2018 in general (AAPC +1.635%, P<0.001), and in males, females, Mexican Americans, Non-Hispanic Blacks and other ethnicities. No significant change in ALD prevalence was found. Compared to MASLD predominant individuals, ALD predominant individuals had higher risks of all-cause [hazard ratio (HR): 1.189, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.026 to 1.378, P=0.02] and cancer-related mortality (subdistribution HR: 1.277, 95% CI: 1.032 to 1.579, P=0.02). No significant difference was observed for all-cause, cancer-related, or cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality in MetALD and CVD-related mortality in ALD predominant individuals, relative to MASLD predominant individuals. CONCLUSIONS: ALD predominant patients have higher all-cause and cancer-related mortality risks than MASLD predominant patients but not CVD-related mortality. SLD is highly heterogeneous in clinical characteristics, prevalence, and mortality risks which healthcare professionals must account for to avert adverse health outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Hepatolithiasis, a common condition in East Asia, often requires surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of near-infrared fluorescence (NIF)-guided laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) using the 'biliary territory' concept for hepatolithiasis. METHODS: This retrospective study included 97 patients who had undergone LH for hepatolithiasis between June 2018 and November 2022. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether intraoperative NIF-guided (n=31) or traditional white light (WL) laparoscopy (n=66) had been performed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to create 27 pairs for comparison. Perioperative outcomes, stone recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were assessed. RESULTS: Prior to PSM, NIF guidance was associated with reduced bleeding (P=0.01) and a lower conversion rate (P=0.001). After PSM, only the postoperative albumin concentration differed significantly between the two groups (P=0.003). The median duration of follow-up was 36 months. Before PSM, RFS differed significantly between the groups (P=0.009), whereas in the matched cohort, the stone recurrence rate was 33.3% in the WL group and 7.4% in the NIF group; however, the RFS did not differ significantly between these groups (P=0.09). Postoperative complications were identified by Cox regression analysis as an independent risk factor for recurrence (95% CI: 1.02-15.21, P=0.047). CONCLUSIONS: NIF-guided LH is a safe and effective approach to the treatment of hepatolithiasis, long-term outcomes being comparable to those of traditional techniques. Future studies should be larger and have longer follow-up.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Factors Affecting Presentation Delay to the Hospital Among Breast Cancer Patients: A Retrospective Analysis.",
        "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer constituted 13.5% of all reported new cancer in India, with a notable mortality rate due to late presentation. The current research aims to address the extent of delay in presentation to the hospital and the factors that contribute to delayed presentation among breast cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 138 primary breast cancer patients aged 18 to 60 years, with a time lag of more than 2 weeks between the initial recognition of symptoms and the first medical interaction. These patients were attending the oncology Outpatient Department (OPD) of tertiary care center in Central India, where female breast cancer patients receive treatment and follow-up care. The analysis employed binary logistic regression to assess the factors significantly affecting the delayed presentation to the hospital. RESULTS: Most of the participants were aged between 40 and 50 years and did not have a family history of breast cancer. The median delay in presentation to the hospital was 2 months. Women having breast lump as initial breast symptom tend to present late (> 3 months) to the hospital (p=0.037) and if the breast lump was smaller, they are more likely to delay seeking medical attention compared to those with larger breast lump (p=0.012). CONCLUSION: The study indicates that many patients delayed seeking help due to small breast lumps. Improved screening services are needed for early detection. Future awareness campaigns should emphasize the link between breast lumps and cancer to reduce delays and improve patient quality of life.",

We aimed to estimate the Life Attributable Risk (LAR) of breast cancer in Shiraz, Iran, linked to HRCT use during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Namazi Hospital in Shiraz from February 2, 2020, to December 31, 2022.The Imaging Performance Assessment of CT Scanners (ImPACT) patient dosimetry calculator was used to determine organ doses. LAR was computed utilizing the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) Committee models. RESULTS: The sample size was 666, with ages spanning from 15 to 95 years. 25% (168) had HRCT more than once (2 to 8 times). The mean and 95% uncertainty limits (UL) for Total LAR of breast cancer, considering both single and multiple doses of radiation exposure, was 217 (95% UL, 194-244) per 100,000 persons. CONCLUSION: According to our research, the risk of potential breast cancer should not be overlooked. It is advised to use the ultra-low-dose protocol over the low-dose in HRCT.

        "AbstractText": "The Zika virus has been shown to infect glioblastoma stem cells via the membrane receptor  \u03b1 v \u03b2 5   , which is activated by the stem-specific transcription factor SOX2. Since the expression level of SOX2 is an important predictive marker for successful virotherapy, it is important to understand the fundamental mechanisms of the role of SOX2 in the dynamics of cancer stem cells and Zika viruses. In this paper, we develop a mathematical ODE model to investigate the effects of SOX2 expression levels on Zika virotherapy against glioblastoma stem cells. Our study aimed to identify the conditions under which SOX2 expression level, viral infection, and replication can reduce or eradicate the glioblastoma stem cells. Analytic work on the existence and stability conditions of equilibrium points with respect to the basic reproduction number are provided. Numerical results were in good agreement with analytic solutions. Our results show that critical threshold levels of both SOX2 and viral replication, which change the stability of equilibrium points through population dynamics such as transcritical and Hopf bifurcations, were observed. These critical thresholds provide the optimal conditions for SOX2 expression levels and viral bursting sizes to enhance therapeutic efficacy of Zika virotherapy against glioblastoma stem cells. This study provides critical insights into optimizing Zika virus-based treatment for glioblastoma by highlighting the essential role of SOX2 in viral infection and replication.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a suspected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based diagnosis of MVNT between 2018 and 2022 were collected from the hospital database. In addition, patients diagnosed with DNET on histopathological examination and who had MRIs in the same time period were included in the study. The MRI findings and clinical features were evaluated for each patient. RESULTS: There were 21 patients in the MVNT group and 20 patients in the DNET group. Headache was the most common symptom in patients with MVNTs (61.9%), whereas seizures were more prevalent in those with DNETs (70%). The most frequent locations for the MVNTs were the frontal and parietal lobes (66.6%), while DNETs were most commonly located in the temporal lobe (60%). All the MVNTs were hyperintense in both fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). All the DNETs were hyperintense on T2WI. However, on FLAIR, seven (35%) of the DNET lesions were hyperintense, while the remaining 13 lesions showed mixed signal intensity forming a bubbly appearance. Moreover, 20 of 21 (95.23%) MVNTs were hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (b800), with no apparent diffusion coefficient hypointensity in the lesions. None of the DNETs showed hyperintensity on DWI. CONCLUSION: MRI findings, particularly those observed on FLAIR and DWI, may be helpful for distinguishing between MVNTs and DNETs, especially in cases where the differential diagnosis is challenging.",

Concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy with DAPT can potentially reduce the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). AIM: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the prevention of UGIB with concomitant use of PPI with DAPT. METHODS: We reviewed several databases to identify randomized controlled trials comparing the risk of UGIB in patients using DAPT + PPI vs . DAPT with no PPI or DAPT + Histamine 2 receptor antagonists. Our outcomes of interest were UGIB, major cardiovascular adverse events (MACE), myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality. We calculated pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all of the outcomes and analyzed data using random effect model. Heterogeneity was assessed using I 2 statistic. RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials comprising 6708 patients were included. Rate of UGIB was significantly lower in the PPI + DAPT group, RR (95% CI): 0.39 (0.25-0.60). There was no significant difference in the rate of MACE between groups, RR (95% CI): 0.87 (0.69-1.10). Rate of MI was also not significantly different between groups, RR (95% CI): 0.93 (0.75-1.14). Rate of mortality was significantly lower in the PPI + DAPT group, RR (95% CI) 0.46 (0.27-0.80).

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: We aim to perform image-guided, dose-escalated, well-controlled liver-irradiated animal studies and subsequently evaluate radiation induced liver injury (RILI) using longitudinal CT. METHODS: Eighteen 6-8 weeks mice were divided into three groups: control, 15Gy and 30Gy irradiated groups. The animal protocol was approved by the animal care ethics committee of our institution. Precision radiotherapy started with CT simulation, followed by treatment planning using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), image guidance with cone beam CT (CBCT) and radiation delivery on a medical linear accelerator. Weekly CT was conducted on the same CT simulator using same scanning parameters. At the end of fifth week, all mice were sacrificed, and histological staining was performed. Body weight, liver volume, HU values and histogram distributions were analyzed. RESULTS: Body weight of irradiation groups was significantly reduced compared to that of the control group (p<0.05). Liver volume in irradiated groups was reduced too. The average liver HU was significantly reduced in irradiated groups (HU mean = 62\u00b13, 48\u00b16, and 36\u00b18 for the control, 15Gy and 30Gy respectively; p control vs. 15Gy < 0.05, p control vs. 30Gy < 0.05). A linear relationship between liver HU and radiation dose was found. Furthermore, HU histogram changes with time and dose showed not only density but also structure might be affected by radiation. HE and Masson Trichrome staining confirmed histological change and increased collagen deposition in irradiated liver. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal unenhanced CT is a useful imaging tool to evaluate the severity and progression of radiation induced liver injury.",

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the individualized neoadjuvant therapies for operable esophageal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data of 95,444 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer between 2010 and 2017 were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT), and surgery alone was compared in patients with stage II esophageal cancer. Patients with stage III disease were divided into \"local invasive type\" group (type I, T3N1M0, T4N0-1M0) and \"regional metastatic type\" group (type II, T1-2N2-3M0) according to the tumor invasion pattern. The effectiveness of nCRT and nCT in different patterns was compared. RESULTS: In 2,706 patients with stage II disease, a statistical difference was observed in the overall survival (OS) between nCRT (85.1%), nCT (3.0%), and surgery alone (11.9%, P<0.001, median OS (mOS): 54 vs 41 vs 24 months). Meanwhile, 3,303 patients with stage III disease who received nCRT were included in the propensity score matching. A statistical difference was observed in the OS between \"Type I\" (n = 217) and \"Type II\" (n = 217, P = 0.023, mOS: 45 VS 28 months). Among 93 patients with stage III receiving nCT, those with \"Type II\" (23.7%) showed a greater potential benefit from nCT than those with \"Type I\" (76.3%, P = 0.686, mOS: 51 vs 40 months). CONCLUSIONS: nCRT is recommended for stage II esophageal cancer. In patients with stage III, those with \"local invasive type\" may greatly benefit from nCRT, while those with \"regional metastatic type\" may greatly benefit from nCT.",

        "AbstractText": "Previously, a synchrotron-based horizontal proton beamline (87.2 MeV) was successfully commissioned to deliver radiation doses in FLASH and conventional dose rate modes to small fields and volumes. In this study, we developed a strategy to increase the effective radiation field size using a custom robotic motion platform to automatically shift the positions of biological samples. The beam was first broadened with a thin tungsten scatterer and shaped by customized brass collimators for irradiating cell/organoid cultures in 96-well plates (a 7-mm-diameter circle) or for irradiating mice (1-cm2 square). Motion patterns of the robotic platform were written in G-code, with 9-mm spot spacing used for the 96-well plates and 10.6-mm spacing for the mice. The accuracy of target positioning was verified with a self-leveling laser system. The dose delivered in the experimental conditions was validated with EBT-XD film attached to the 96-well plate or the back of the mouse. Our film-measured dose profiles matched Monte Carlo calculations well (1D gamma pass rate >95% with the criteria of 2%/1 mm/2% dose threshold). The FLASH dose rates were 113.7 Gy/s for cell/organoid irradiation and 191.3 Gy/s for mouse irradiation. These promising results indicate that this robotic platform can be used to effectively increase the field size for preclinical experiments with proton FLASH.",

        "AbstractText": "A 47-year-old woman underwent [18F]-FDG and [18F]-NOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT to assess the staging of suspected axillary lymph node enlargement following breast-conserving surgery. The imaging with these two PET agents revealed starkly contrasting results. Significant [18F]-FDG uptake in the right axillary fossa, intrathoracic muscles, and clavicle lymph nodes led nuclear medicine physicians to suspect metastasis. However, no uptake of [18F]-NOTA-FAPI-04 was observed. Subsequently, the patient underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the enlarged axillary lymph nodes, which pathologically confirmed the diagnosis as inflammation. After a multidisciplinary discussion, the patient received radiotherapy for the right breast and 2.15Gy/F\u00d728F for the tumor bed. She was discharged following the completion of her radiotherapy. Accurate diagnosis and staging are pivotal in selecting the optimal clinical treatment for breast cancer patients. Notably, [18F]-NOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT downgraded this patient's staging, significantly influencing the treatment strategy.",

The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of 3D gamma index as an additional metric beyond standard measurement-based comparisons for more efficient evaluation of treatment plans between linacs with nominally matched beam models to ensure safe patient transfer. Seventeen 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) plans and thirty-six volumetric-modulated radiation therapy (VMAT) plans for different disease sites were selected from the original linac. An in-house script was used to automatically create new plans for the target linac and calculate dose using parameters of the original plans. 3D gamma analysis was performed to compare plan dose distributions between the target and original linacs using PyMedPhys. The 2%/2 mm gamma pass (\u03b3\u22641) rate was >99.99% for all 3DCRT plans. The median 1%/1 mm pass rate was 99.86% but two cases failed (< 90%). For VMAT plans, the median and minimum 2%/2 mm gamma pass rates were 99.43% and 93.81%. For 1%/1 mm, the median pass rate was 92.02% but ten cases failed. The results indicated using 3D gamma index can enhance the confidence and add an extra layer for safe patient transfer.",

Although the treatment's effects are known to impact occupational participation, little is known about how breast cancer could affect occupational identity. This study aims to illuminate the lived experience of women long-term after breast cancer treatment through an occupational perspective in order to explore how they perceive their occupational identity. METHODS: A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews was conducted with six women, who had all received a diagnosis of breast cancer and treatment for longer than a year. Reflexive Thematic Analysis was used to analyse the data. FINDINGS: Three intertwined themes describe the participants' experience. (1) 'Disruptions in daily life and Environmental support', (2) 'Be able to do' and identity, and (3) 'Doing what matters and is possible'. Findings revealed that the occupational identities of the participants were maintained. Cancer treatment effects appear to impact occupational competence that corresponded to participants' occupational identities, suggesting difficulties in the order of occupational adaptation. CONCLUSION: Our findings contribute to understanding the challenges to occupational participation related to the occupational identity of women following breast cancer and treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "After receiving the pathology report for breast cancer, the first question most patients ask their doctor is about their journey ahead. The type of cancer and how it spreads can give us an idea of what to expect during follow-up. Unfortunately, there is a lack of reporting, management, and documentation of breast cancer cases in India, resulting in a shortage of information on the different types of breast cancer. To address this issue, a study was conducted to gain a better understanding of the pattern of breast carcinoma in Northwestern India. A total of 2619 breast cancer pathology reports were gathered from four major diagnostic centres in Northwest India. Out of all breast cancer patients, 97.74% (2560) were women, while men accounted for only 2.25% (59) of the sample. At the time of diagnosis, 72% of patients were in stages III and IV, while only 28% of patients were in the early stages of cancer (stages I and II). The most common type of breast cancer was infiltrating duct carcinoma (IDC), which constituted 80.71% (2114/2619) of all malignant lesions. infiltrating lobular carcinoma was the second most common pathology, accounting for 5.38% (141/2619) of all cases. The rarer pathologies had a presentation rate below 10%. Our study revealed the most common symptom as a painless lump. Significant majority presented in advanced stages. An alarming 20% presented with foul-smelling ulceration or fungation of the skin. Varied presentations of breast cancer subtypes were evident. As the age-old saying goes-the 'most common' is often ignored as a large portion of the researcher's attention is focused on 'rarer stuff'. Similarly, IDC being the commonest deserves most of our attention. Not just the histology but its grades too. The lack of awareness regarding the risk factors and early detection methods of breast cancer is unfortunately even prevalent in 49% of healthcare workers. What India needs are more data reporting, timely diagnostic strategies, standardized reporting for pathology, and guideline-based management strategies. Increasing data collection electronically in the coming years will help India in displaying more data.",

        "AbstractText": "Osteosarcoma is a matrix-producing neoplasm. Most patients are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT. Various parameters are available for response assessment which include radiological and histological criteria. Data on clinical responses such as pain response and size assessment is meagre. In this study, we aimed to analyze if clinical assessment used for response evaluation can predict prognosis in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for extremity osteosarcoma. All patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma and who underwent treatment with curative intent between January 2000 and December 2018 were identified. Patients who had progression were identified and whether clinical progression impacted overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed. Forty-three patients who had progression on NACT were identified. When compared to patients who did not have clinical progression, more patients in the clinical progression group had large tumors (p = 0.025), the majority underwent amputation (p = <0.001), and most were poor responders to chemotherapy (p = 0.011). Clinical progression on NACT predicted poor OS and DFS on univariate analysis but not on multivariate analysis. Although patients with clinical progression had poor oncological outcomes, it was not a statistically significant factor affecting oncological outcomes. The role of continuing the same chemotherapy regimen in the adjuvant setting in this subset of patients is doubtful. Large multicentric studies are needed to know the prognostic impact of clinical progression during NACT on oncological outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "Testicular cancer is notorious for its myriad presentations. In this case report, we present a 28-year-old gentleman diagnosed with metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT). After receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, he was found to have a large paracaval conglomerate nodal mass infiltrating the inferior vena cava (IVC), with a contiguous thrombus extending from the vena cava to the right atrium. The pre-operative imaging was ambiguous, with the cavo-atrial thrombus appearing to float within the vascular lumen at some places and infiltrating the caval wall at others. Hence, arrangements were made for cardiopulmonary bypass, sternotomy, and vascular surgeon backup. Intraoperatively, the vena cava was palpated in its entirety up to the mediastinum, and the thrombus was found to be freely floating. Hence, the thrombus was milked out in its entirety from the right atrium up to the vena cava, and the paracaval mass was resected en bloc with the tumor thrombus. The IVC was reconstructed with a Dacron graft. A review of the literature revealed no previously documented cases of contiguous cavo-atrial tumor thrombus. Approaching cases requires an assessment of the nature of the thrombus and the need to prepare for the worst. It is worth remembering that going the extra mile concerning obtaining a complete tumor clearance is worth it in NSGCTs, given the highly gratifying outcomes.",

Some of these patients are at high risk for relapse based on the higher axillary nodal burden. This prospective study evaluated the presence of de novo asymptomatic distant metastases in HROBC with pT1/2 N2a/N3 on upfront surgery. A single-centre study was carried out in upfront operated OBC patients with four or more axillary nodes positive after definitive surgery. Comprehensive metastatic workup was carried out, including an ultrasound abdomen, bone scan, and CT scan (thorax-abdomen-pelvis) or PET scan before initiating adjuvant treatment. If a distant disease was detected, the adjuvant treatment intent was tailored accordingly. The study accrued a prospective consecutive cohort of 97 women with pT1-2 N2a-3 during 2015-2018 operated upfront for OBC with cT1-2 N0-1. Forty percent of women were premenopausal, 54 (55.6%) had pN2a, and 43 (44.3%) had pN3 disease. Distant disease was seen in 8 of 97 women (8.24%) of these high-risk early cancers, 5 had oligometastatic denovo disease (5.15%), and 3 had polymetastatic (3.09%). Between the 2 groups, the pickup rate of distant disease was higher in pN3 (11.4%) as against pN2a (5.6%), p\u2009=\u2009NS. Only 3.09% of patients with extensive metastases were treated with palliative intent.

The secondary objective was to assess the effect of ICG-FA\u00a0on the post-operative outcomes, and also the effect of the various variables on the ICG staining grade. A total of 50 patients were included. Sixty percent of the patients received pre-operative radiotherapy, including short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) and long-course concurrent chemoradiation (LCRT).

The present study aims to analyze the MMP (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13) and TIMP (TIMP-1 and TIMP-3) expression in the oral cancer patients as compared to healthy controls. We also aim to compare the diagnostic accuracy of MMPs and TIMPs on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with respect to the immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Although surgery remains the primary treatment option, complex resections are frequently required to attain clear margins. Traditionally, a part of the jaw bone close to the tumour is resected (segmental mandibulectomy) during the surgery. However, marginal mandibulectomy (MM), involving the resection of the mandibular rim while preserving its continuity, offers a less debilitating alternative to segmental mandibulectomy (SM) in selected cases. This review examines marginal mandibulectomy's oncological safety and efficacy and its current role in managing oral cavity cancers, as indicated by the most recent literature. MM is an effective treatment for tumours, which abut the mandible without bone invasion and provides comparable oncological outcomes to SM, with fewer functional and cosmetic deficits. The authors also propose a classification based on the plane of resection and location within the mandible. We believe this classification will be helpful in reporting the MM series done in various centres in a uniform fashion. However, there is a need for precise surgical planning before doing an MM for obtaining the optimal results.",

This present study aims to assess the expression of PPAR \u03b3 by immunohistochemistry in colorectal carcinoma and its correlation with clinicopathological characteristics. Most of the cases were elderly males, and pelvic pain and bleeding were the predominant symptoms. Colon carcinoma was more common than rectal carcinoma. The adenocarcinoma NOS and mucinous carcinoma were the common histological types, and 40% cases showed lymph node metastasis. The PPAR \u03b3 expression was present in 61.8% of the patients, and it showed a significant correlation with lymph node metastasis and tumor location (p\u2009=\u20090.05 and p\u2009=\u20090.04). The overall survival was slightly higher but non-significant in patients with positive PPAR \u03b3 expression than negative ones (p\u2009=\u20090.7). The multivariate analysis revealed that nodal metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were the independent prognostic factors for colorectal carcinoma. The PPAR \u03b3 expression showed a significant correlation with lymph node metastasis and tumor location. Thus, we hypothesized that the PPAR \u03b3 expression might affect the overall survival in colorectal cancer.

Chemotherapy induces gonadotoxicity through mechanisms such as DNA damage, follicular apoptosis, and hormonal disruption, compromising ovarian function and fertility. The risk of infertility may be low, intermediate, or high depending upon the drug used, the dose, and the duration of use. Quantifying chemotherapy's impact is challenging due to diverse agents and variable effects. Guidelines recommend discussing fertility preservation options with WCBP before treatment, using biomarkers like anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) to assess ovarian reserve. Strategies include cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, embryos, and oocytes, each with distinct advantages and considerations. Pharmacological interventions like GnRH agonists aim to mitigate gonadotoxic effects, although their efficacy is debated. Surgical approaches like oophoropexy protect ovaries during pelvic radiation but pose logistical challenges. Fertility preservation involves ethical and psychosocial dimensions, including informed consent, financial considerations, and ethical dilemmas, necessitating comprehensive patient counselling. Future research focuses on enhancing techniques such as in vitro maturation, developing artificial ovaries, and refining cryopreservation methods to optimize outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "Rectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the GI tract. Although recent technology and treatments are available today, complications are still there. The focus of this study is to draw attention towards the important complications and their management options in rectal cancer surgeries. Retrospective study of 57 patients diagnosed and operated with rectal cancer between 2012 and 2022 using questionnaire data. 21.05% developed complications following surgery for rectal cancer including SSI, LARS, anastomosis leak, and stomal stenosis. LARS was seen in 26.31% out of the 19 patients involved in the study (LAR\u2009+\u2009ULAR) of which 80% had minor LARS scores and 20% had major LARS scores. In LARS, 80% had received long-term chemoradiotherapy in a neoadjuvant setting. The study revealed a rising trend of rectal cancer in young individuals (35.08%). Complications are an inevitable part of rectal cancer surgery even with recent technology. Use of long-course radiotherapy in neoadjuvant settings and LAR and ULAR may improve sphincter preservation with the risk of increasing incidence of low anterior resection syndrome, and anastomosis leak should be used cautiously with proper patient selection.",

        "AbstractText": "The objective is to test the role of baseline endogenous testosterone (ET) in discriminating adverse tumor grades and predicting disease progression in prostate cancer (PCa) patients, who harbored organ-confined disease at radical prostatectomy (RP). Between November 2014 and December 2019, data on PCa patients treated with robot-assisted RP at a single tertiary referral center were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline ET levels were coded as abnormal (\u2264\u2009350\u00a0ng/dL) vs. normal (>\u2009350\u00a0ng/dL) according to a standard consensus. In the surgical specimen, the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade groups 3 and 4/5 were classified as unfavorable tumor grades. Disease progression was defined as biochemical recurrence/persistence and/or local recurrence and/or distant metastases. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression models were used. Overall, 460 patients were included. In the surgical specimen, adverse tumor grades were detected in 198 (43.0%) patients of whom 60 (13.0%) harbored ISUP grade group 4/5. Disease progression occurred in 62 (13.5%) patients. In multivariable regression models that adjusted for other available clinical and pathological factors, patients with abnormal baseline ET levels were less likely to associate with unfavorable tumor grades, as well as to experience PCa progression (hazard ratio: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.26-0.92; p\u2009=\u20090.026). In pathological organ-confined PCa, baseline ET levels predicted disease progression after discriminating unfavorable tumor grades. Accordingly, baseline ET is a risk factor that might further stratify patients diagnosed with PCa.",

Due to the obscure criteria available for diagnosing IBC, in this review, we gathered all the reliable information in the literature about the definition of IBC in the last decade to identify important features that should be considered in the diagnosis. We conducted this systematic review on MEDLINE and PUBMED by searching for the keywords \"inflammatory breast cancer,\" \"diagnosis,\" \"criteria,\" or \"definition.\" The time limit of this study was 13\u00a0years, from 2010 to 2023. Our basic search revealed 158 articles and finally 24 studies were approved and evaluated. The prevalence of clinical signs and symptoms and imaging and pathologic features were analyzed. The clinical criteria for the definition and diagnosis of IBC were mentioned in 100% of the studies, with the most common being skin changes (erythema, edema, and peau d'orange) in all 24 articles, rapid onset (<\u20096\u00a0months) in 66.6% of the studies, and involvement of at least one-third of the breasts in 41.6% of the studies. The imaging criteria for IBC diagnosis were discussed in 11 studies (45.8%), with the most common imaging sign being diffuse involvement of the breast and skin thickening (72.7%). Five studies (20.8%) evaluated the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of IBC and reported the following findings: heterogeneous enhancement, edema on T2-weighted images, asymmetrical enhancement, diffuse non-mass enhancement, skin enhancement, and Cooper's ligament enhancement. Pathology-specific findings were common in 10 articles (41.6%), which included dermal/non-dermal lymphatic tumor emboli. This study suggested that IBC should be suspected in the presence of rapid-onset (at least less than 6\u00a0months) erythema and edema, regardless of its extent, and when suspected, mammography and ultrasound should be performed to search for diffuse skin or parenchymal involvement, multicentric disease, and suspicious regional lymph nodes. MRI and skin biopsy could be helpful when the diagnosis is not clear (e.g., no underlying mass).",

The objective of the current study was to investigate the prognostic impact of novel histopathological features (TIL, TB, TBC, TSR) and a new combined risk score (CRS) in primary CRC. This cross-sectional observational study was conducted on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides of 65 primary CRC cases. Stromal TIL was categorized into 3 groups: low (0 to 10%), intermediate (15 to 50%), and high (55 to 100%). Tumor budding was counted in 10 HPFs and graded as follows: 0-4 buds-low TB, 5-9 buds-intermediate TB, and 10 or more buds-high TB. TBC was labeled as either pushing or infiltrative. TSR was scored into two groups as high TSR (low stroma as\u2009\u2264\u200950%) and low TSR (high stroma\u2009>\u200950%). A novel CRS was constructed based on TBC, TB, and TSR: Infiltrating TBC, TB score\u2009>\u20095 (median), and low TSR were categorized as risk items. Final categories were as follows: low-risk tumors with\u2009\u2264\u20091 risk item and high-risk tumors with\u2009>\u20091 risk items. TIL showed a significant correlation with histological tumor type; TB was significantly associated with tumor location, grade, T stage, and perineural invasion, while TBC significantly correlated with tumor location only. TSR showed significant association with tumor location and perineural invasion, while the combined risk score significantly correlated with tumor location and grade. Tumor border configuration, tumor budding, tumor stroma ratio, and the newly formed combined risk score are simple, cost-effective, potential markers in colorectal cancer patients, suggesting that their incorporation in the routine histopathological evaluation could be useful in determining the prognosis of colorectal cancer cases.",

        "AbstractText": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has an estimated 5-year survival rate of 11% and remains a formidable challenge. Despite evolving pancreaticoduodenectomy techniques, the pinnacle status of laparoscopic surgery persists. Technological advancements since Gagner and Pomp's 1994 breakthrough have expanded its reach, yet it remains complex. Although safety reports exist, large-scale studies establishing the viability of laparoscopic surgery for PDAC are scarce. This study aimed to provide an up-to-date meta-analysis, scrutinizing all relevant trials, especially recently published ones, to discern differences between laparoscopic and open pancreaticoduodenectomy procedures. This meta-analysis, following the PRISMA guidelines, systematically searched the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled trials on pancreaticoduodenectomy up to November 25, 2023. Data extraction, quality assessment, and statistical analysis, including primary and secondary outcomes, were conducted using rigorous methodology. The study employed Review Manager 5.4 for analysis, with significance set at P\u2009<\u20090.05. This meta-analysis, comprising five randomized controlled trials (laparoscopic, 605; open, 601; total, 1206), utilized the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, revealing minimal bias. Primary outcome analysis indicated a shorter hospital stay with laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (S.M.D.\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.18, 95% CI\u2009-\u20090.63\u2009-\u20090.28, P\u2009=\u20090.45) and reduced blood loss (S.M.D.\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20091.96, 95% CI\u2009-\u20093.05, 0.88, P\u2009=\u20090.0004), but increased operative time (S.M.D.\u2009=\u20091.74, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.53, P\u2009<\u20090.0001). The secondary outcomes showed no significant differences in morbidity, mortality, resection, fistula, gastric emptying, hemorrhage, bile leak, reoperation, readmission, and surgical site infection between the two procedures. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) offers marginal benefits over open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD), including reduced blood loss and shorter hospital stays. However, LPD requires a significantly longer operative time, and no substantial differences have been observed in terms of mortality or other complications. Additional studies with lower heterogeneity are needed to thoroughly evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of LPD and OPD.",

The most frequent sarcoma in this location is liposarcoma; complete resection is the gold standard of treatment. To achieve this, a multivisceral resection is often necessary to reduce local recurrence. However, this approach must be balanced by the potential for added morbidity. This study aims to evaluate the platelet-albumin ratio as a predictor of morbidity risk. A retrospective review of the medical records of patients with retroperitoneal liposarcomas operated with curative intent at our institution between January 2010 and December 2020 was performed. The platelet-albumin ratio was calculated, and a cutoff point of 78.86 was determined to predict morbidity by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, divided into high-risk and low-risk groups with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 71.6%. These risk groups were contrasted with the different demographic and evolution variables. One hundred thirty-six patients were analyzed, and 91 met the inclusion criteria; age at presentation was 52.55\u00a0years (SD 12.96), tumor size was 29.31 (SD 12.43), and 40.7% underwent multivisceral resections, identifying a difference between the presence of a high platelet/albumin ratio and the appearance of complications at 30\u00a0days with an OR of 8 (CI 1.0052 to 63.6698, p 0.0494).

The demographic pattern, American Society of Anaesthesia grade (ASA), treatment received, clinical and histopathological T and N stage, grade, type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approach, neoadjuvant therapy, and pathological high-risk features are also studied. Patients who underwent minimally invasive ISR over 10\u00a0years at a high-volume tertiary cancer center were selected for the study. Factors used for the assessment of oncological outcomes were margin positivity (circumferential resection and distal margin), recurrence (both local and systemic), and stoma reversal rate. A descriptive and comparative analyses were performed. Four hundred and eight patients underwent minimally invasive ISR of which 25 (6.12%) patients were oligometastatic.

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: To facilitate the use of quantitative modeling of biological effects in treatment planning by introducing a simpler function equivalent to the Lyman formula for calculating normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). METHODS: We first provide an approximation of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) formula using three parameters (n, m, TD50) as a function of equivalent uniform dose (EUD). The parameters for the new formula are defined in terms of the Lyman model's m and TD50. Conversely, m and TD50 are expressed in terms of the parameters of the new equation. The role of the Lyman volume-effect parameter n remains unchanged from its role in the Lyman model. RESULTS: The new formula, which exhibits a sigmoidal shape, demonstrates symmetry about TD50, akin to the LKB model. The difference in NTCP between the two formulas is less than 0.1%. The parameters (n, m, TD50) are preserved through rigorous mathematical deduction and have been recalibrated to the tolerance data of Emani et\u00a0al. using the proposed formula. This new model provides a better fit to these data than the model by Burman et\u00a0al., which was fitted \"by eye\" rather than using statistical methods. CONCLUSION: We have developed a formula that represents NTCP as a function of EUD, which proves to be potentially useful. The parameters derived in this study are mathematically robust and offer a superior fit to the data compared to previous efforts.

Radiopharmaceuticals typically consist of a small amount of radioactive material, a radionuclide, paired with a chemical that specifically targets the cell. Some radionuclides naturally target specific cells or biological processes without the need for modification. RPT is a novel\u00a0cancer treatment method\u00a0that offers various advantages over current traditional treatment\u00a0approaches. One of the primary advantages of RPT is its ability to target cancer cells, including those in metastatic areas. Another key advantage of RPT is that radiation can be delivered systemically, locally, or physiologically to specific cells internally rather than being applied externally. Moreover, radiotracer imaging\u00a0can be utilized to determine radiopharmaceutical absorption in target tissues before providing a therapeutic dose. Compared to all other\u00a0cancer treatment approaches, RPT has demonstrated high efficacy with minimal toxicity. The recent approval of multiple RPT medicines by the US Food and Drug Administration highlights the tremendous potential of this treatment.

        "AbstractText": "Cholangiocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy arising from the biliary tract epithelium with rising incidence and mortality. Imaging commonly used for diagnostic workup includes computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) scans can be used for investigating equivocal findings on radiographic imaging. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is known to be highly expressed in prostate adenocarcinoma, allowing it to be leveraged as a target for both imaging and radioligand therapy in prostate cancer. However, PSMA is also commonly expressed in other malignancies such as breast cancer, thyroid carcinomas, and head and neck malignancies, which increase the chances of their incidental diagnosis on PSMA PET scans. Biliary tract cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma, are not commonly expected to be incidentally diagnosed on PSMA PET imaging. Here, we describe the case of a patient with known prostate adenocarcinoma who was later incidentally diagnosed with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma on PSMA PET/computed tomography (CT). This case highlights the unexpected finding of cholangiocarcinoma on PSMA PET/CT and suggests further investigation into the role of PSMA PET in diagnosing ambiguous cases of cholangiocarcinoma and its potential theranostic applications.",

        "AbstractText": "Objective \u2003Focusing on the heterogeneity within cancer lesions and revealing cancer lesions with a high signal-to-noise ratio will help improve the quality of positron emission tomography (PET) images. This study aimed to understand how glucose metabolic activity can be shown with less statistical noise using a quality assessment phantom modeled after cancer lesions with a two-layer structure and a Clear adaptive Low-noise Method (CaLM) filter. Materials and Methods \u2003A National Electrical Manufacturers Association phantom with two spheres with a two-layer structure filled with 2-deoxy-2[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose (inner and outer diameters of the spheres were 13/22 and 22/37\u2009mm, respectively; radioactivity ratio of the background [BG] to outer sphere layer was 1:4; and BG-to-inner sphere layer ratios were 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3) was evaluated. The acquisition time was set at 120\u2009seconds, and imaging was repeated five times. The image data in photomultiplier tube (PMT)-PET were reconstructed using a time-of-flight (TOF) ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm (point spread function [PSF]\u2009-\u2009, iteration: 3, subset: 10) with a 4-mm Gaussian filter (GF) for normal images. Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-PET data were reconstructed using a TOF OSEM algorithm (PSF\u2009-\u2009, iteration: 2, subset: 12) and a 3-mm GF for normal images. The target images were reconstructed using three CaLM parameters (mild, standard, and strong). All the obtained images were investigated quantitatively, with calculation of maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), coefficient of variation (CV), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), after setting regions of interest on the lesions. Statistical analysis using the Dunnett's test compared normal images (control group) and target images (treatment group). Statistical significance was considered at p \u2009<\u20090.05. Results \u2003Quantitative assessment revealed that the SUVmax of target images (standard and strong) was equivalent to that of normal images in PMT-PET, with SUVmax of 3 to 3.5 for both layers. The SUVmax in SiPM-PET was similar across all CaLM types, ranging from 3 to 4 for all spheres. The target images (standard and strong) had a significantly reduced CV and improved CNR compared with normal images. Conclusion \u2003The boundary of the 22/37-mm spheres was visible with CaLM (strong) at radioactivity ratios of 1:4:1 and 1:4:2 on both scanners. For the 13/22-mm sphere boundary, visibility with CaLM (strong) was observed only with SiPM-PET, with the SUVmax equivalent to normal images. CaLM (strong) was deemed the optimal postprocessing filter for PMT-PET due to significant improvements in CV and CNR, while CaLM (standard) was suggested as the optimal filter for SiPM-PET due to excessive BG smoothing.",

        "AbstractText": "Lung oligometastases represent an intermediate state of cancer dissemination between localized and widespread metastases. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as an effective treatment option, with an efficacy comparable to that of surgical resection. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the latest advancements and controversial issues regarding SBRT for lung oligometastases. It focuses on four crucial perspectives: efficacy of SBRT, optimal patient selection criteria, technological innovations, and synergistic effects of SBRT combined with systemic therapy. Relevant clinical trials investigating SBRT for lung oligometastases have been conducted, with median 1- and 5-year local control rates of 90% and 79%, respectively. The origin of the primary tumor, size and number of lesions, and biomarker profiles were highlighted as pivotal considerations in patient selection. The precise dose delivery was enhanced using robotic SBRT and optimized dose fractionation schemes. Evidence suggests that dose escalation above 100 Gy biologically effective dose may improve tumor control. Combined immunotherapy and SBRT have demonstrated synergistic effects in prolonging progression-free survival and overall survival. This review provides valuable insights into the precise treatment of oligometastatic lung diseases using SBRT. Further multicenter randomized trials are warranted to develop definitive patient selection criteria and optimize the integration with systemic therapies.",

        "AbstractText": "Esophageal cancer is among the top causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and the main treatment modality for locally advanced esophageal cancer is concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The current photon-based radiotherapy modalities and procedures have increased the incidence of treatment-related cardiac and pulmonary complications. Additionally, anatomical changes in the esophagus resulting from diaphragmatic movement, weight loss, and tumor progression present challenges for radiotherapy. These challenges have spurred interest in particle therapies, such as proton beam therapy (PBT) and heavy-ion therapy, for esophageal cancer. This paper comprehensively reviews the dosimetric advantages, clinical efficacy, and limitations of PBT and heavy-ion therapy for esophageal cancer and discusses their prospects. This highlights the unique dosimetric benefits of these therapies, particularly their ability to deliver high-dose radiation precisely to the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal organs and tissues. Although PBT and heavy-ion therapy demonstrate superior clinical efficacy compared to photon therapy, they are not without limitations. Multiple studies are needed to further validate and supplement the existing clinical and preclinical data to better exploit the benefits of PBT and thereby provide improved survival advantages to these patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Temporal bone squamous cell carcinoma (TBSCC) is a rare and invasive malignant tumor. The common predisposing factors include a history of local radiotherapy and chronic suppurative otitis media. The current treatment approach for TBSCC primarily involves surgery, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, based on T staging and high-risk factors. Although patients with early-stage TBSCC have a high survival rate after treatment, the majority of patients are diagnosed in the intermediate to advanced stages, with extensive tumor involvement, posing challenges for surgical intervention. Definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) serves as a viable alternative for unresectable tumors. Constraints in administering curative radiation doses, due to the tolerance of surrounding organs, can lead to uncontrolled tumor growth. Although programmed cell death 1 inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, their application in TBSCC remains underexplored. Herein, we report a case of a 47-year-old man diagnosed with unresectable advanced and localized TBSCC.

METHODS: Thirty patients with head and neck cancers were prospectively selected for this study. The reference anterior to posterior (AP) digitally reconstructed reference radiograph image was obtained at a gantry angle of 0\u00b0. The AP portal images were acquired at angles of 0\u00b0, 0.5\u00b0, 1\u00b0, 1.5\u00b0, and 2.0\u00b0. The average deviation of the isocenter shift with respect to the zero-gantry angle was calculated. To check the dosimetric effects, the reference fluence was compared with different fluences measured at different isocenter shifts. RESULTS: The average isocenter shift differences in the lateral direction were 0.7 mm, 1.3 mm, 1.9 mm, and 2.5 mm. The average difference was <\u00b10.1 mm for isocenter shift in the longitudinal direction. The results of the statistical analysis showed that the average isocenter shift and gamma pass rate with respect to the different isocenter position errors were significant in the lateral direction.

Recent studies have identified pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death induced by inflammatory caspases, as playing a role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, the functions and mechanisms of pyroptosis in HCC are barely explored.MethodsGene expression and clinical data were derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. A prognostic signature and nomogram were constructed by on differentially expressed genes and clinical data. Pathway enrichment and immune cell infiltration were further analyzed. Potential drugs to modulate the pathways were explored.ResultsIn this study, a pyroptosis-related gene signature was developed and identified to be significantly correlated with the survival of HCC patients. Additionally, a nomogram on the basis of pyroptosis-related genes was constructed with distinct prognostic values. Furthermore, the pyroptosis-related gene signature might correlate with immune-related pathways and the regulation of the immune microenvironment, and several compounds (KIN001-220, TPCA-1, LY-303511, physostigmine, vemurafenib, etc.) could potentially reverse the pathogenic gene-expression patterns.Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that pyroptosis is involved in HCC development, progression and immune microenvironment, which is promising in predicting the prognosis and developing targeted therapy.",

The BCD-TransNet model that incorporates with five different pre-trained networks in which the knowledge attained by each model is transfer to next network for extracting the most relevant features. This detection model has two different phases namely first level classification for identifying benign and malignant cells and the second level classification for identifying the different types in benign and malignant.

Headaches, nausea, and balance problems are caused by tumors pressing on nearby brain tissue and affecting its function. The existing techniques are challenging to analyze diseased brain images since abnormal brain tissues lead to distorted or biased results during image processing, like tissue segmentation and non-rigid registration. To overcome these issues, proposed a DS-GAN model for inpainting brain MRI images. Initially, the input MRI images are segmented using a Gated shape convolution neural network (GS-CNN). In the first GAN, grayscale pixel intensities and the remaining image edges are utilized to create edge generators or edge reconstruction Generative Adversarial Networks (EGAN), which are capable of creating false edges in areas that are missing.

Pelvic cancers, a history of hysterectomy, and the incapacity to execute Valsalva maneuvers were among the exclusion criteria. The pelvic floor was imaged in three dimensions using a color Doppler ultrasonography equipment (GE, Voluson E8 Edition) both at rest and during Valsalva maneuvers. Important variables, such as the posterior bladder angle and bladder neck distance, were examined and contrasted with POP-Q evaluations.ResultsAccording to the study, an ultrasonography was used to detect Green II prolapse in 63 individuals and Green III prolapse in 57 patients.

Expanding the stem cells in bioprinted tissues prior to differentiation allows for high cell density, which is important for the formation of cell-cell junctions necessary for macroscale function upon differentiation. Yet, stem cell expansion, critical to successful in situ differentiation, depends heavily on the composition of the bioprinted scaffold. Here, we demonstrate how a common bioink component, gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), varies depending on the vendor and degree of functionalization. We found that the vendor/GelMA production technique played a greater role in dictating the mechanical properties of the bioprinted constructs than the degree of functionalization, emphasizing the importance of reporting detailed characterization of GelMA scaffolds. Furthermore, the ability of singularized hiPSCs to survive and expand in GelMA scaffolds greatly varied across batches from different vendors and degrees of functionalization, where expansion correlated with the mechanical properties of the scaffold. Yet, we found that using a commercial cloning supplement could restore the ability of single hiPSCs to survive and expand across GelMA types, thus compensating for the varied mechanical properties of the scaffolds. These findings provide a practical guide for the expansion of hiPSCs in GelMA constructs with various mechanical properties as required for successful in situ differentiation.",

Antioxidants, like curcumin (Cur), can inhibit these factors. In this research, the effect of curcumin on the expression and activity of two MMP enzymes, MMP-14 and MMP-17, which are involved in the carcinogenesis of mice after chronic exposure to thioacetamide, is investigated. METHODS: In this study, 30 mice were divided into six groups and studied for 4 months. The first group, control; the second group, curcumin; the third group, TAA; the fourth group, TAA and curcumin simultaneously; the fifth group, first treated with TAA for 2 months and then curcumin; and finally, the sixth group, first treated with curcumin for 2 months and then TAA. Afterward, the mice were euthanized, and their liver tissues were transferred to the laboratory for analysis of gene and protein expression. RESULTS: The averages of gene expression were calculated using SigmaPlot software and showed that the expression of MMP-17 and MMP-24 genes and the levels of their proteins were significantly increased by thioacetamide (****p < 0001) compared to the control group. Pathological observations indicated necrosis and dysplastic foci in the TAA group. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the crucial roles of MMPs in various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma, the regulation of their gene expression and enzymatic activity is significant in preventing tumor progression.

However, the upregulation was statistically significant only for hsa_circ_0004771 in CRC patients (p-value = 0.0036) and for hsa_circ_0019120 in both advanced polyp (p-value = 0.0175) and CRC patients (p-value = 0.0356). The combined analysis of both circRNAs achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8348 (95% CI: 0.7131 to 0.9565) with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 80% (p-value = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that hsa_circ_0004771 and hsa_circ_0019120 dysregulated in both CRC and polyps and have potential as a novel diagnostic biomarker of CRC.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The green synthesis of nanoparticles through algae-mediated processes offers an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and scalable approach for producing nanomaterials with potential applications in cancer therapy. The present study investigated the algae-mediated green synthesis of dextran-coated titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) and evaluated their cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 breast cancer cells. METHODS: Chlorella vulgaris was isolated and identified. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplification of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene was used to confirm the isolate. Dextran from C. vulgaris was used to prepare coated TiO2NPs), characterized using three techniques. The cytotoxicity of the dextran-coated TiO2NPs was evaluated using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay on MCF7- breast cancer cells at various concentrations (25, 50, and 75%) and exposure times (24, 48, and 72 hours). The bioactive compounds in the algal extract were also identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS: Chlorella vulgaris was successfully isolated as confirmed by the 345-bp PCR-amplified fragment. The characterization of the TiO2NPs confirmed the successful nanoparticle formation. A cluster of nanocrystalline particles had an average diameter of 71.44 nm. Compositional analysis revealed 15.85% atomic percentage for titanium. The dextran-coated TiO2NPs exhibited an impressive cytotoxicity rate of up to 99% at optimal concentration (25%) and exposure time (48 hours). Additionally, GC-MS analysis identified bioactive compounds in the algal extract, such as fatty acids, which may contribute to the observed anticancer effects. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the potential of algae-mediated TiO2NPs in cancer co-therapy, enhancing treatment effectiveness and reducing the side effects of traditional therapies.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: One of the deadliest cancers in the world, colorectal cancer has a dismal prognosis and a poor response to therapy. It was suggested that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by Escherichia coli (E. coli) are a powerful inducer of inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells. This research aimed to determine the anticancer potential of E. coli-derived OMVs using a colorectal cancer model. METHODS: Five distinct E. coli strains were collected for this study. Their OMVs were then isolated and characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of E. coli-derived OMVs on colorectal cancer were evaluated in vitro and in vivo using a colorectal tumor model in nude mice. RESULTS: Obtained results showed that E. coli probiotic strains released spherical-shaped vesicles ranging from 5 to 200 nm. E. coli-derived OMVs showed that in the untreated group, a large portion of the tumor tissue continued to grow, with only a few cells undergoing apoptosis. Conversely, the OMV-treated group exhibited a higher number of apoptotic cells, highlighting the anticancer effects of E. coli-derived OMVs in colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that E. coli-derived OMVs can be employed as a potential treatment for colorectal cancer with minimal adverse effects. Mechanistic studies indicate that these vesicles may promote apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation, supporting their therapeutic potential.",

Recently, evidence has revealed MET signaling may impact tumor immunogenicity and regulate the immune response. Here we conducted a comprehensive bioinformatic and clinical analysis to explore the characteristics of MET mutation and its association with the outcomes in pan-cancer immunotherapy. In 4149 patients with 12 tumor types treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, MET mutation indicated favorable overall survival (hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.61; 95% CI, 0.50-0.74; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), progression-free survival (hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.92; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and objective response rate (40.3% vs. 28.1%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Moreover, we developed a nomogram to estimate the 12-month and 24-month survival probabilities after the initiation of immunotherapy. Further multi-omics analysis on both intrinsic and extrinsic immune landscapes revealed that MET mutation enhanced tumor immunogenicity, enriched infiltration of immune cells, and improved immune responses. In summary, MET mutation improves cancer immunity and is an independent biomarker for favorable outcomes in pan-cancer immunotherapy. These results may influence clinical practices, guide treatment decision-making, and develop immunotherapy for personalized care.",

This research aimed to examine the function of TUG1 in CHS. We found that TUG1 expression was elevated in CHS. Functional assays demonstrated that TUG1 had a crucial role in the CHS cell progression. Mechanistically, TUG1 recruited ALYREF to maintain the stabilization of enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2) mRNA and expression of H3K27me3, repressing the transcription of the tumor-suppressor gene CPEB1. Additionally, exosomal TUG1 enhanced the polarization of M2 tumor-associated macrophages, which increased the proliferation and metastasis of CHS. Taken together, this study revealed the oncogenic role of TUG1 in CHS and its interactions with the downstream regulatory axis, offering novel insights into the tumorigenic mechanism of CHS.",

Conventional delivery approaches (e.g., endocytosis of nano-vectors, microinjection, and electroporation) usually require time-consuming uptake processes, labor-intensive operations, and/or costly specialized equipment. Here, we present an acoustofluidics-based intracellular delivery approach capable of effectively delivering various functional nanomaterials to multiple cell types (e.g., adherent and suspension cancer cells). By tuning the standing acoustic waves in a glass capillary, our approach can push cells in flow to the capillary wall and enhance membrane permeability by increasing membrane stress to deform cells via acoustic radiation forces. Moreover, by coating the capillary with cargo-encapsulated nanoparticles, our approach can achieve controllable cell-nanoparticle contact and facilitate nanomaterial delivery beyond Brownian movement. Based on these mechanisms, we have successfully delivered nanoparticles loaded with small molecules or protein-based cargo to U937 and HeLa cells. Our results demonstrate enhanced delivery efficiency compared to attempts made without the use of acoustofluidics. Moreover, compared to conventional sonoporation methods, our approach does not require special contrast agents with microbubbles. This acoustofluidics-based approach creates exciting opportunities to achieve controllable intracellular delivery of various biomolecular cargoes to diverse cell types for potential therapeutic applications and biophysical studies.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Exosomes in neurodegenerative diseases: Therapeutic potential and modification methods.",
        "AbstractText": "In recent years, exosomes have garnered extensive attention as therapeutic agents and early diagnostic markers in neurodegenerative disease research. Exosomes are small and can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing them to target deep brain lesions. Recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes derived from different cell types may exert therapeutic effects by regulating the expression of various inflammatory cytokines, mRNAs, and disease-related proteins, thereby halting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and exhibiting beneficial effects. However, exosomes are composed of lipid bilayer membranes and lack the ability to recognize specific target cells. This limitation can lead to side effects and toxicity when they interact with non-specific cells. Growing evidence suggests that surface-modified exosomes have enhanced targeting capabilities and can be used as targeted drug-delivery vehicles that show promising results in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of existing research aimed at devising approaches to modify exosomes and elucidating their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings indicate that exosomes can efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier to facilitate drug delivery and can also serve as early diagnostic markers for neurodegenerative diseases. We introduce the strategies being used to enhance exosome targeting, including genetic engineering, chemical modifications (both covalent, such as click chemistry and metabolic engineering, and non-covalent, such as polyvalent electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, ligand-receptor binding, aptamer-based modifications, and the incorporation of CP05-anchored peptides), and nanomaterial modifications. Research into these strategies has confirmed that exosomes have significant therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases. However, several challenges remain in the clinical application of exosomes. Improvements are needed in preparation, characterization, and optimization methods, as well as in reducing the adverse reactions associated with their use. Additionally, the range of applications and the safety of exosomes require further research and evaluation.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: With advances in rectal cancer management and improved prognosis, there is a growing number of rectal cancer survivors with unique needs. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that a significant proportion of our rectal cancer survivors lack regular access to a primary care physician. Our study aimed to examine the association between access to a primary care physician and survivorship-related emergency department visits. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of rectal cancer survivors who have finished all treatment. PATIENTS: Patients with rectal cancer who underwent proctectomy and completed treatment from 2005 to 2021. SETTING: Single tertiary care center in Quebec, Canada. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Survivorship-related emergency department visits. RESULTS: In total, 432 rectal cancer survivors were included. The median age was 72 (interquartile range, 63-82) years, 190 (44.0%) were women, and the median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 5 (interquartile range, 4-6). There were 153 individuals (35.4%) not registered with a primary care physician. Sixty individuals visited the emergency department due to survivorship-related concerns. Using Cox proportional hazards analysis, lack of registration to primary care physicians was associated with a higher probability of having survivorship-related emergency department visits. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by observational design. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of regular access to primary care physicians may contribute to increased emergency department visits among rectal cancer survivors. Efforts to improve access to a primary care physician and coordinate interdisciplinary care are needed to improve care for survivors. See Video Abstract.

Like those of conventional drugs, the use of RPs may also be associated with the development of various adverse events (AEs). The information obtained from patients about these AEs may empower medical professionals to identify, evaluate, and manage them more efficiently to ensure the safe use of RPs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess the type, timing, and frequency of the reported AEs associated with the use of RPs and to establish their causal association as well as to evaluate the outcome of these AEs from the perspective of patients. METHODS: This study was a prospective cohort study conducted on 315 patients who underwent nuclear medicine examination in a tertiary care center for various indications. Relevant data were collected from the participants regarding suspected AEs associated with the use of various RPs. The collected data were objectively analyzed and assessed. RESULTS: Of 315 patients, 39 (12.3%) developed 59 AEs. All the reported AEs were mild in nature and neither required hospitalization nor caused death of any participants. 37.2% of the reported AEs occurred within 1 h of administration of the RPs and spontaneously resolved within a few hours. Of these 59 AEs, 10 had causal associations (possible or probable) with RPs and were considered adverse drug reaction (ADR). The incidence of ADR in our study was 2.2%. CONCLUSION: RPs can cause ADRs though it is less in comparison to conventional drugs. We expect that our study will increase the awareness of AEs associated with the use of RPs among patients and health-care professionals and encourage its reporting.",

METHODS: This retrospective study included 22 patients (20 males, 2 females; mean age: 63.6 years; range, 43 to 79 years) who required open heart surgery and had a detected lung mass during preoperative evaluation. All the patients were discussed between cardiac and thoracic surgery teams, and different approaches according to patient and mass characters were chosen. Thoracic computed tomography and positron emission tomography scans and, when needed, biopsies were used to determine mass characters. RESULTS: Seven patients were deemed to have small benign nodules, and it was decided not to intervene on the mass. A biopsy before surgery was performed in two patients, and an intervention was not deemed necessary in these patients. One patient was evaluated as having late-stage lung cancer, and no cardiac surgical intervention was performed. Ten patients underwent cardiac surgery and lung resections or lobectomies in a simultaneous operation. Two of the patients subsequently underwent a separate thoracic surgery after the cardiac surgery. There was no perioperative mortality or myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: Managing patients with both cardiac disease requiring surgery and a lung mass is complex and necessitates a multidisciplinary approach. The decision to perform combined surgery or staged procedures should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, the nature of the lung mass, and the urgency of the cardiac condition. While outcomes for combined procedures are generally favorable in well-selected patients, they require meticulous perioperative planning and long-term follow-up.",

Studies show that smoking after lung cancer diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of developing other cancers and shorter survival. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between postdiagnosis smoking cessation and survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Data were collected between January 2014 and December 2019 in three hospitals in Southern Taiwan. Patient data were collected from the hospitals' databases, and the correlation between smoking status and patient survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. RESULTS: A total of 681 patients with advanced NSCLC were included in this study. The numbers (percentage) of ex-smokers and current smokers were 334 (49%) and 347 (51%), respectively. More than half of the patients in this study continued to smoke postdiagnosis advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, ex-smokers had lower mortality risk, even though this was not statistically significant (P = 0.212). The results of this study suggest that older than 65 years, men, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 3 and higher, history of chronic disease, receive chemotherapy, and targeted therapy are correlated with and have predictive effects on advanced NSCLC survival. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference between postdiagnosis smoking cessation and survival in patients with advanced NSCLC. The reason for this finding may be due to lower survival rates after diagnosis with advanced NSCLC, and the benefits of smoking cessation cannot be seen immediately.",

Several observational studies, predominantly from Asian populations, have suggested a link between these conditions. Thus, the primary objective of the current study was to examine the association between H.\u00a0pylori and MASLD and secondarily, to assess its association with related conditions in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 16,144 participants with baseline data on H.\u00a0pylori serology were included. Based on weighted statistics, the median age was 40 years [interquartile range (IQR): 28, 52]; 52.2% women (n\u00a0=\u00a09661) and 47.8% men (n\u00a0=\u00a06483). Participants' Hispanic/Latino heritage included 37.6% Mexicans (n\u00a0=\u00a06397), 20.1% Cubans (n\u00a0=\u00a02307), 15.8% Puerto Ricans (n\u00a0=\u00a02663), 10.0% Dominicans (n\u00a0=\u00a01447), 7.4% Central Americans (n\u00a0=\u00a01710), 4.9% South Americans (1052). MASLD was estimated using the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and the Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI). Other conditions examined were obesity, central obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate the ratios of (adjusted) prevalences (RP) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the overall association of H.\u00a0pylori seropositivity with MASLD and related conditions. Analyses were also stratified by Hispanic/Latino heritage. FINDINGS: The overall prevalence of MASLD ranged from 47% (FLI) to 65% (HSI). After accounting for age, sex, education, and other key variables, the analysis found a modest association between H.\u00a0pylori seropositivity and MASLD as determined by HSI (RP: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02-1.10) overall, and among individuals of Puerto Rican and Mexican heritages. Furthermore, an overall association between H.\u00a0pylori seropositivity and obesity was observed (RP:\u00a01.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.16). INTERPRETATION: This study provides support for a positive association of H.\u00a0pylori seropositivity with MASLD and obesity among Hispanic/Latino populations. However, given the exploratory nature of these findings, caution is warranted in their interpretation. Further research is necessary to establish causality and examine potential mechanisms\u00a0of these associations.

We conducted a scoping review to compile data on H pylori seroprevalence in asymptomatic populations to assess global trends by age and birth cohort. We found that published data suggest H pylori seroprevalence declined among recent birth cohorts and increased with age, with trends differing between regions and sub-regions subject to data availability. The Americas lacked sufficient data to enable more robust assessment of H pylori trends by both age and birth cohort. FUNDING: NCI: U01CA265729, P30 CA008748; NIDDK: K08 DK125876.",

        "AbstractText": "Drug combinations are increasingly utilized in cancer treatment to enhance drug effectiveness through synergistic therapeutic effects. However, determining the optimal biological dose combination (OBDC) in small-scale drug combination trials presents challenges due to the increased complexity of the dose space. To effectively optimize the dose combination of combined drugs, we propose a model-assisted design by extending the single-agent Bayesian optimal interval phase I/II (BOIN12) design. Our approach incorporates a utility function to balance the trade-off between risk and benefit and directly models the utility of each dose by constructing a quasi-beta-binomial model. A key advantage of our design is the simplification of decision-making during interim periods by considering all possible outcomes and pre-including the decision rule in the protocol. Additionally, we present a time-to-event (TITE) version of our design, employing an approximate likelihood approach to mitigate potential late-onset effects. We demonstrate that our proposed design exhibits robust and desirable operating characteristics across various scenarios through extensive simulation studies.",

        "AbstractText": "AIM: While the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) has been the most prominent among interpretable predictors for steatotic liver disease (SLD), we aimed to prepare a novel diagnostic/prognostic index better than FLI for SLD using a non-black-box and modified parsimonious machine learning method. METHODS: We included individuals who participated in an annual health checkup in Tokyo, Japan, between January 2008 and December 2018. In the training set (randomly selected 80% of the sample), we developed a novel interpretable model, Steatotic Liver Index (SLI), using a modified method of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression focusing on parsimony and interpretability using as few variables as FLI, and confirming its superiority to FLI using the test set (the remaining 20%). The predictive performance of the constructed index was assessed for the diagnosis, development,\u00a0and remission of SLD. RESULTS: Among ultrasound data of 92\u00a0968 participants at the first health checkup, 20\u00a0380 (21.9%) had SLD. Using a modified method of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, SLI was constructed with four variables: body mass index, waist circumference, alanine aminotransferase, and triglycerides. The C-statistic of SLI for SLD diagnosis was superior to that of FLI (0.909 vs. 0.892, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In participants without SLD, SLI was more accurate than FLI in predicting SLD development, whereas among those with SLD, SLI showed better accuracy in predicting SLD remission compared with FLI. CONCLUSIONS: We developed SLI, a novel interpretable and parsimonious index for diagnosing SLD, which demonstrates superior predictive capability compared with FLI. Further studies are necessary to validate the diagnostic ability outside Japan.",

Recently, the diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) has shown the potential to generate high-quality images by converting Gaussian random noise into realistic images. In this paper, we apply the DPM to augment the deep ultraviolet fluorescence (DUV) image dataset with an aim to improve breast cancer classification for intra-operative margin assessment. For classification, we divide the whole surface DUV image into small patches and extract convolutional features for each patch by utilizing the pre-trained ResNet. Then, we feed them into an XGBoost classifier for patch-level decisions and then fuse them with a regional importance map computed by Grad-CAM++ for whole surface-level prediction. Our experimental results show that augmenting the training dataset with the DPM significantly improves breast cancer detection performance in DUV images, increasing accuracy from 93% to 97%, compared to using Affine transformations and ProGAN.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Isolinderalactone (ILL), extracted from the dried tubers of Linderae aggregate, has multiple functions, such as antioxidation, antitumor, and anti-infection effects. However, there have been few studies on ILL's antitumor role and no reports on its role in bladder cancer (BC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human BC cell lines T24 and EJ-1 were treated with different concentrations of ILL (0, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 \u03bcmol/L), and the cell proliferation inhibition rate was analyzed using the CCK-8 assay. The effect of ILL on T24 and EJ-1 cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis was examined using flow cytometry. Immunoblotting was used to detect the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, BAX, BAK1, and CYCS, in BC cells of the control and ILL-treated groups, and quantitative PCR experiments were performed to detect the apoptosis-related gene expression of CASP10, CYCS, BAX, BCL-2, CASP8, and BAK1. T24 and EJ-1 tumor-bearing mouse models were established and divided into vehicle control, low-dose (10 mg/kg) and high-dose (20 mg/kg) groups, with 5 mice in each group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry were used to detect changes in apoptosis-related proteins in vivo. RESULTS: The CCK-8 assay showed that in vitro, ILL significantly inhibited the proliferation of the T24 and EJ-1 BC cell lines. Flow cytometry and immunoblotting results showed that ILL increased mitochondrial permeability by upregulating proapoptotic proteins BAK1 and BAX, promoting CYCS release and significantly inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. In vivo, on day 25 of administration, tumor inhibition rates in T24 and EJ-1 tumor-bearing mice were up to 75.24% and 47.43%, respectively, in the ILL high-dose-treated and 71.58% and 43.89%, respectively, in the ILL low-dose-treated groups.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Bipolar transurethral enucleation of the prostate (B-TUEP) is a well-established surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); however, its efficacy may vary depending on patient characteristics. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with radiomics analysis can offer comprehensive and quantitative information about prostate characteristics that may relate to surgical outcomes. This study aimed to explore the value of MRI and radiomics analysis in predicting the short-term efficacy of B-TUEP for BPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 137 patients with BPH who underwent B-TUEP at 2 institutions were included. Radiological features were measured in the MRIs, and the radiomics score was developed from 1702 radiomics features extracted from the prostate and transitional zone regions of interest. Three prediction models were developed and validated based on clinical-radiological features, radiomic features, and their combinations. The models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: The combination model exhibited the highest area under curve in both the training set (0.838) and the external validation set (0.802), indicating superior predictive performance and robustness. Furthermore, the combination model demonstrated good calibration (p > 0.05) and optimal clinical utility. The combination model indicated that a higher maximum urine flow rate, lower transitional zone index, and higher radiomics score were associated with an increased risk of poor efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging with radiomic analysis can offer valuable insights for predicting the short-term efficacy of B-TUEP in patients with BPH. A combination model based on clinical and radiomics features can assist urologists in making more precise clinical decisions.",

Radiogenomics is an extension of radiomics and involves a combination of conventional radiomics techniques with molecular analysis in the form of genomic and transcriptomic data. In the field of bladder cancer, studies have investigated the development, implementation, and efficacy of radiomic and radiogenomic nomograms in predicting tumor grade, gene expression, and oncological outcomes, with variable results. We aimed to perform a systematic review of the current literature to investigate the development of a radiomics-based nomogram to predict oncological outcomes in bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched up to February 17, 2023. Gray literature was also searched to further identify other suitable publications. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 and Radiomics Quality Score. RESULTS: Radiogenomic nomograms generally had good performance in predicting the primary outcome across the included studies. The median area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity across the included studies were 0.83 (0.63-0.973), 0.813, and 0.815, respectively, in the training set and 0.75 (0.702-0.838), 0.723, and 0.652, respectively, in the validation set.

They are common sites for plaque-induced and nonplaque-induced diseases. AIM: This study aims to compare the categories, frequencies, and age distribution of the biopsied gingival and alveolar mucosal lesions, as well as to report their distribution at these two sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was performed on biopsied gingival and alveolar mucosal lesions taken for 13 years. The necessary information was noted, tabulated, and subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of 5068 biopsies, 302 (5.95%) gingival and 70 (1.38%) alveolar mucosal biopsies were obtained, with female (61.82%) and male dominance (38.17%), respectively. Among gingival biopsies, reactive lesions were the most common (86.75%), followed by inflammatory and immune conditions and lesions (5.29%), neoplasms (3.64%), specific infections (0.33%), and gingival pigmentation (0.33%). The alveolar mucosal biopsies were most commonly diagnosed as well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (58.57%), followed by moderately differentiated (28.57%), poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (5.71%), adenoid cystic carcinoma (2.85%), malignant salivary gland tumor (2.85%), and pyogenic granuloma (1.42%). CONCLUSION: The study results show a high prevalence of gingival and alveolar mucosal biopsied lesions. Most reports suggested a prevalence of reactive lesions in gingival biopsies; on the contrary, alveolar mucosa showed predominance of neoplastic lesions.

METHODS: Retrospective review of an institutional database of patients aged 50\u00a0years or younger undergoing resection for non-small cell lung cancer between January 1995 and March 2022. A control group of patients older than age 50\u00a0years was selected by stratified random sampling. Relevant characteristics were compared with Wilcoxon rank sum,\u03c7,2 and Fisher exact tests. Propensity-score weighting was used to control for confounders. OS and locoregional recurrence-free survival were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: We identified 196 patients aged 50\u00a0years or younger and 232 patients older than age 50\u00a0years. Median age was 46\u00a0years (interquartile range, 43-49\u00a0years) in the younger group and 69\u00a0years (interquartile range, 63-74\u00a0years) in the older group. Younger patients were more often women, non-White, and with fewer comorbidities. They more often presented with symptoms, stage III or IV disease, and more often received neoadjuvant therapy. In unweighted analysis, younger patients showed superior OS (log-rank P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). After propensity score weighting for procedure type, histologic type, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and smoking status, there was no significant difference in OS at 5\u00a0years between younger and older groups (70.62% vs 72.99%; weighted log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a0.084).

In Kenya, it is the 2nd most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Globally, more than 50% of Cervical Cancer diagnoses are made late, with this proportion rising to over 80% in developing countries. This study aimed to determine the individual-level factors contributing to delayed cervical cancer diagnosis. A cross-sectional hospital-based study was adopted to collect data on; Socio-demographics, affordability and use of health insurance, Cervical cancer and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screening awareness, Prior HPV screening, Diagnosis circumstances, Time taken to seek medical attention, Fears and social support experiences, from 139 cervical cancer patients systematically sampled at the Kenyatta National Hospital, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Additionally, 8 Key Informants were purposively selected, to provide in-depth information. Associations between stage at diagnosis and individual-level factors were tested using logistic regression at 95% Confidence Interval. The mean age was 51 years and all participants were African and Christians. Majority (63.31%) were married and educated up to primary level, and more than half (61.15%) were unemployed. The prevalence of delayed diagnosis was 86(61.9%). The Risk Factors for delayed diagnosis were; Older age; 50-59 (p-value=0.049) & 60-69 years (0.013), Lack of HPV screening awareness (P-value=0.017), and Seeking medical attention only due to a symptomatic trigger (P-value=0.030). In corroboration, qualitative information reported that, inability to afford diagnosis costs, lack of awareness and poor medical care seeking habits, contribute to delayed diagnosis. The study identified gaps in awareness of Cervical Cancer and HPV screening among women and affordability of diagnosis costs. More community-level awareness should be created and, increase of centers and resources for diagnosis and free screening. Women should also be encouraged to pay for the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), so as to lessen their financial burden of diagnosis.",

Some patients receiving docetaxel develop serious problems with fluid retention, which leads to peripheral edema formation, reducing the patient's quality of life. This study investigated the effect of docetaxel administration on fluid dynamics in mice as a step toward developing advanced preventive measures in nursing. METHODS: Mice were administered 10\u00a0mg/kg/day of docetaxel intravenously for 5 days as the intervention group or with normal saline as the control group. To investigate fluid dynamics on day 5, the leakage of blood plasma, interstitial fluid volume, and fluid transportation capacity into lymph vessels were evaluated and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The Miles assay with Evans Blue, an albumin-binding dye, revealed that leakage of blood plasma was significantly increased in the control group compared with the intervention group (p<0.01). Results of the interstitial fluid volume and fluid transportation capacity were similar between the two groups, but the fluid transportation capacity tended to be higher in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel administration in our mouse model caused the leakage of blood plasma without proteins from the blood vessels into the interstitial tissues, which appeared at the initial stage of edema formation. This model might be useful for assessing the leakage of blood plasma and, subsequently, the development of preventive measures against edema formation.",

In clinical trials, the high response rate of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients to ICI therapy supported the basic premise of cancer immunotherapy, that tumour-specific mutated proteins trigger an immune response. Tumour mutational burden subsequently emerged as a potential biomarker for response to ICI therapy.

Nonetheless, despite the recent success of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy, such response rates in cancer patients have been limited to tumors encompassing specific tumor microenvironment characteristics. The altered metabolic activity of cancer cells shapes the anti-tumor immune response by affecting the activity of immune cells. However, it remains mostly unknown how the altered metabolic activity of cancer cells impacts their resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy. Here, we found that tumor cell-derived lactic acid renders the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-resistant tumors by inhibiting the interaction between the PD-L1 protein and anti-PD-L1 antibody. Furthermore, we showed that the combination therapy of targeting PD-L1 with our PD-L1 antibody-drug conjugate (PD-L1-ADC) and reducing lactic acid with the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) inhibitor, AZD3965, can effectively treat the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-resistant tumors. The findings of this study provide a new mechanism of how lactic acid induces an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and suggest a potential combination treatment to overcome the tumor resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Surgery is the first-line curative treatment for most solid-organ malignancies. During major surgeries, fluid under- or over administration can have a significant impact on recovery and postoperative outcomes. For patients undergoing oncologic surgery, delayed recovery or complications could additionally impact subsequent oncologic treatment planning. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the impact of goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) on perioperative outcomes after oncologic surgeries. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science citation index for clinical trials comparing the GDFT to routine clinical care. The primary outcomes of interest are the hospital length of stay and the total incidence of postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes include organ-specific complications and recovery of bowel function. RESULTS: The literature search was last updated on February 17, 2024. We identified a total of 24 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing GDFT to routine care with 1172 and 1186 patients, respectively. The GDFT arm had a significantly shorter length of hospital stay (mean difference [MD], 1.57 days, 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.29 to -0.85, P < .01), as well as lower incidence of complications (risk ratio, 0.74, 95% CI, 0.56-0.97, P = .03). The GDFT arm also had a shorter time to bowel function recovery (MD, 0.58 days, 95% CI, -1.02 to -0.14, P = .01). None of the included trials reported the longer-term oncologic outcomes. The overall certainty of evidence is low due to between-study variance and study risk of bias. Trial sequence analysis indicates that further studies are unlikely to alter the conclusion regarding postoperative length of stay but may provide further information on the postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that in oncologic surgery, intraoperative GDFT significantly reduces the length of hospital stay, lowers the risk of complications, and facilitates bowel function recovery. Further studies are required to evaluate whether the improvement in early postoperative outcomes leads to better long-term oncologic outcomes.",

METHODS: Information reported on death certificates is presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics. Causes of death are processed according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision . Beginning in 2018, all states and the District of Columbia were using the 2003 revised certificate of death for the entire year, which includes the 1997 Office of Management and Budget revised standards for race. Data based on these revised standards are not completely comparable to previous years. RESULTS: In 2021, a total of 3,464,231 deaths were reported in the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 879.7 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population, an increase of 5.3% from the 2020 rate. Life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years, a decrease of 0.6 year from 2020.

While the penetration of UV radiation through vehicle windows is well-documented, the potential transmission of IR radiation remains less recognized. METHODS: A total of 1,293 participants participated in a survey to assess awareness of solar radiation risks and protective behaviors, revealing a notable lack of attention to protective measures despite widespread knowledge of the risks associated with solar exposure. This study investigates UV and IR radiation exposure inside and outside vehicles in the Middle East, a region known for its extreme temperatures exceeding 52\u00b0C. Radiation levels were measured using a PMA2100 data logger radiometer in 20 vehicles. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results demonstrated the ability of both UV and IR radiation to transmit through vehicle windows. For instance, the highest UV transmission through the side and front windows were recorded at 1.70 and 0.80 mW/cm2, respectively, while the IR transmission through the side and front windows were 84.17 and 98.27 mW/cm2, respectively. These findings highlight the need for improved protective measures against both UV and IR radiation, especially in hot climates where prolonged exposure to solar radiation is common. The study also identifies a gap in public awareness of IR radiation and calls for further research into effective strategies for mitigating these risks.",

In this work, we demonstrate that proper orthogonal decomposition, by which a low-dimensional representation of the full model is constructed, can be used to dramatically reduce the computational time required to calibrate a partial differential equation model to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for rapid predictions of tumor growth and response to chemotherapy. In the proposed formulation, the reduction basis is based on each patient's own MRI data and controls the overall size of the \"reduced order model\". Using the full model as the reference, we validate that the reduced order mathematical model can accurately predict response in 50 triple negative breast cancer patients receiving standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The concordance correlation coefficient between the full and reduced order models was 0.986 \u00b1 0.012 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) for predicting changes in both tumor volume and cellularity across the entire model family, with a corresponding median local error (inter-quartile range) of 4.36% (1.22%, 15.04%). The total time to estimate parameters and to predict response dramatically improves with the reduced framework. Specifically, the reduced order model accelerates our calibration by a factor of (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 378.4 \u00b1 279.8 when compared to the full order model for a non-mechanically coupled model. This enormous reduction in computational time can directly help realize the practical construction of digital twins when the access to computational resources is limited.",

The ESBL E. coli isolates carry resistance genes from various antibiotic classes such as the \u03b2-lactams (bla TEM, bla CTX-M-15 and bla CTX-M-55), quinolones (gyrA, qnrS and qnrS1) and aminoglycosides (aph(3')-Ia, aph(6)-Id and aac(3)-IId). Three concerning convergence of ESBL, colistin and metal resistance determinants, with three plasmids from H-type lineage harbouring bla CTX-M and mcr-1.1 genes were identified. Using the Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) Native Barcoding Kit (SQK-NBD114.24) in conjunction with the R10.4.1 flow cell, which achieved an average read accuracy (Q\u2009>\u200910) of 99.84%, we further characterised the mcr-1.1-bearing plasmids, ranging in size from 25 to 28\u2009kb, from three strains of E. coli. This report represents the first whole genome analysis of multidrug-resistant bacteria, specifically those resistant to colistin, found within the indigenous population in Malaysia. It strongly indicates that the pertinent issue of colistin resistance in the country is far more significant than previously estimated.",

        "AbstractText": "Since the pandemic in 2019, coronaviruses (CoVs) have been a great concern for public health burden. The fact that CoVs can infect all animals including domestic ones and livestock points to a future pandemic even though interaction between human and wildlife animals is restricted. Moreover, interspecies transmission abilities of CoVs by mutations make them drastically risky not only for humans but also for animal health. Recently, a new CoV outbreak in cats in Cyprus, the so-called FCoV-23, has been realized. In addition to worries over animal health, any possible transmission to humans is now controversial. However, there have been limited characterization studies on FCoV-23. Thus, we aimed to assess the possible transmission of FCoV-23 to humans using in silico prediction tools. Accordingly, we first checked the binding affinities of receptor binding domain (RBD) of FCoV-23 against feline target protein and its human homolog. Next, we randomly and rationally created mutations on the RBD sequence and evaluated the binding affinities using protein docking tools. Our results underlined that multiple mutations at the same time were needed for increased binding affinity towards human target protein, demonstrating that the probability of transmission to humans was extremely low when mutation rates were regarded. Still, further molecular studies are required to comprehensively conclude the possible transmission risk.",

        "AbstractText": "Our goal is to develop a general strategy to decompose a random variable X into multiple independent random variables, without sacrificing any information about unknown parameters. A recent paper showed that for some well-known natural exponential families, X can be thinned into independent random variables  X ( 1 )  , \u2026 , X ( K )   , such that X = \u2211 k = 1 K X ( k )      . These independent random variables can then be used for various model validation and inference tasks, including in contexts where traditional sample splitting fails. In this paper, we generalize their procedure by relaxing this summation requirement and simply asking that some known function of the independent random variables exactly reconstruct X . This generalization of the procedure serves two purposes. First, it greatly expands the families of distributions for which thinning can be performed. Second, it unifies sample splitting and data thinning, which on the surface seem to be very different, as applications of the same principle. This shared principle is sufficiency. We use this insight to perform generalized thinning operations for a diverse set of families.",

Therefore, most patients are in the developmental stage of work. Returning to work after cancer treatment has become common.ObjectiveTo explore the perceptions and experiences of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer about continuing to work after cancer.MethodsUsing the descriptive phenomenological research method, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who entered the follow-up period, and the data were analyzed using the Colaizzi 7-step analysis method and managed with the help of Nvivo 11.ResultsThe themes of work experience are as follows: necessary reasons for continuing to work: survival needs, supporting family, work for recovery; negative effects of disease in work status: distressing cancer symptoms, fear of disease recurrence, difficult choice between health and future, labeling of cancer patients; support and coping: family support, social support, professional information support.ConclusionsEconomic factors play an important role in differentiated thyroid cancer survivors' choice to continue working. Patients who are currently in a work status have some distress, but to some extent, the work status facilitates survival and treatment.

        "AbstractText": "Exosomes encompass a great deal of valuable biological information and play a critical role in tumor development. However, the mechanism of exosomal lncRNAs remains poorly elucidated in bladder cancer (BCa). In this study, we identified exosomal lnc-TAF12-2:1 as a novel biomarker in BCa diagnosis and aimed to investigate the underlying biological function. Dual luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pulldown assays, and xenograft mouse model were used to verify the competitive endogenous RNA mechanism of lnc-TAF12-2:1. We found exosomal lnc-TAF12-2:1 up-regulated in urinary exosomes, tumor tissues of patients, and BCa cells. Down-regulation of lnc-TAF12-2:1 impaired BCa cell proliferation and migration, and promoted cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and cell apoptosis. The opposite effects were also observed when lnc-TAF12-2:1 was overexpressed. lnc-TAF12-2:1 was transferred by intercellular exosomes to modulate malignant biological behavior. Mechanistically, lnc-TAF12-2:1 packaged in the exosomes relieved the miRNA-mediated silence effect on ASB12 via serving as a sponger of miR-7847-3p to accelerate progression in BCa. ASB12 was also first proved as an oncogene to promote cell proliferation and migration and depress cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis in our data. In conclusion, exosomal lnc-TAF12-2:1, located in the cytoplasm of BCa, might act as a competitive endogenous RNA to competitively bind to miR-7847-3p, and then be involved in miR-7847-3p/ASB12 regulatory axis to promote tumorigenesis, which provided a deeper insight into the molecular mechanism of BCa.",

Materials and Methods \u2003Tests for magnetic susceptibility (translational attraction and torque), MRI-related heating, and artifacts were conducted based on the American Society for Testing and Materials standards. The magnetic susceptibility tests evaluated the scanner's magnetic force that can cause clip movement and rotation. The heating test was conducted with customized MRI parameters of short TR and maximum echo-train length, designed to induce temperature change. The artifact test, using T1-weighted spin and gradient echo imaging sequences, evaluated potential image misrepresentations (localized signal loss) caused by the clip's metallic properties. Statistical Tests \u2003None. Results and Conclusion \u2003The magnetic susceptibility tests indicated no noticeable translational or rotational force exerted by the MRI scanner. The heating test indicated no significant temperature change (<0.3\u00b0C) in the testing gel when the clip was absent/present, both within the safety threshold (<1\u00b0C). The artifact test's clip images all contained an artifact (largest radius\u2009=\u200910.7\u2009mm). These cumulative results indicate that this clip is safe in 7T scanners. Scanning at least 10.7\u2009mm away from the clip avoids potential signal loss in the region of interest.",

GBC has distinct morphological types that pose unique challenges in diagnosis and differentiation from benign lesions. There are no specific clinical or serological markers of GBC. Imaging plays a key role not only in diagnosis and staging but also in prognostication. Ultrasound (US) is the initial test of choice that allows risk stratification in wall thickening and polypoidal type of gallbladder lesions. US findings guide further investigations and management. Computed tomography (CT) is the test of choice for staging GBC as it allows comprehensive evaluation of the gallbladder lesion, liver involvement, lymph nodes, peritoneum, and other distant sites for potential metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography allow better delineation of the biliary system involvement. Contrast-enhanced US and advanced MRI techniques including diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI are used as problem-solving tools in cases where distinction from benign lesion is challenging at US and CT. Positron emission tomography is also used in selected cases for accurate staging of the disease.

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary nodules (PNs) are frequently detected by chest CT scan, which is increasingly used in clinical practice. Accurately identifying malignant nodules can pose a diagnostic challenge; therefore, a high-specificity biomarker could help clinicians identify malignant nodules and ideally lead to the earlier diagnosis of lung cancer. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the performance characteristics of a blood-based biomarker for identifying malignancy in patients with a CT-detected PN? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Banked plasma samples from 2 independent prospective observational cohorts of patients presenting with benign or malignant PNs 8 to 30 mm in size were tested using a 7-autoantibody panel. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the autoantibody test (AAT) to identify cancer were calculated for the individual and combined cohorts. RESULTS: Overall, 447 patients (263 and 184 from each cohort) were included in the analysis with a prevalence of malignancy of 55%. The performance of the AAT between the 2 cohorts was similar. The AAT demonstrated a specificity of 90% (95% CI, 85%-93%), a positive predictive value of 66% (95% CI, 52%-77%), sensitivity of 16% (95% CI, 12%-22%), and false-positive rate of 10% in the combined cohort. Using a pretest probability of cancer cutoff of 20% improved the positive predictive value to 76% (95% CI, 61%-88%) and resulted in a 52% decrease in the number of false-positive test results. In the subset of patients who had 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging performed for clinical purposes (n = 222), specificity of the AAT was higher (93% vs 58%, P < .001), but the sensitivity was lower than 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan (17% vs 75%, P < .001). INTERPRETATION: This study validates the specificity of a blood-based autoantibody biomarker for identifying malignancy in patients with indeterminate PNs. This rule-in biomarker may help to expedite workup of malignant nodules.

For the first time since the pandemic began, New Zealand was experiencing high levels of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We enroled a cohort of households to better understand differences in transmission dynamics among subvariants of Omicron. We enroled 71 households, comprising 289 participants, and aimed to use viral genomes to gain a clearer understanding of variant-specific differences in epidemiological parameters affecting transmission dynamics. Approximately 80% of the households enroled experienced transmission of BA.2, while most of the remaining households had infections with BA.1 or BA.5. Using a logistic regression generalised linear mixed model, we found no difference in household secondary infection rate between Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5. Of the households recruited, the vast majority (92%) experienced a single chain of transmission with one inferred introduction. Further, we found that in 48% of the households studied, all household participants became infected following an index case. Most household participants tested positive within a week following an introduction, supporting the seven-day isolation requirement for household contacts that was in place in New Zealand at the time. By integrating genomic and epidemiological data, we show that viral transmission dynamics can be investigated with a higher level of granularity than with epidemiological data alone. Overall, households are a high risk setting for viral transmission in New Zealand.",

The authors hypothesized that the implant foreign body response could induce a local protective anticancer immunosurveillance. The authors expanded on their previous finding, which showed that women with breast implants have elevated antibody responses to certain breast cancer proteins. METHODS: Blood samples and breast tissue were collected from women undergoing first time breast augmentation (implant-naive [IN]) and revision breast augmentation (implant-exposed [IE]). Sera were collected and antibody levels to common breast cancer proteins were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed on breast tissue samples to quantify immune-related gene expression levels between IN and IE patients. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes and altered signaling pathways in the breasts of IN patients versus IE patients. RESULTS: In total, 188 patients were recruited (IN, n = 117; IE, n = 71). Data demonstrated that IE patients had higher levels of antibodies to mucin-1, estrogen receptor-\u03b1, and mammaglobin A compared with IN patients. Mucin-1 expression was found to be higher in IE compared with IN breast tissue. RNA- sequencing analysis demonstrated up-regulated pathways in IE breast tissue for B-cell activation and development, T-helper cell type 2-related genes, T-cell activation, chemotactic factors, and responses to estrogen. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that periimplant inflammation extends beyond the implant capsule to the breast parenchyma. Women with breast implants have more activated B cells in the breast parenchyma and elevated antibody responses to breast cancer antigen. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, V.",

        "AbstractText": "Five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer patients has increased to 12.8% afterthe initial diagnosis, still making it one of the deadliest cancertypes. This disease is known as the \"silent killer\" because early detection is challenging due to the location of the pancreas in the body and the nonspecific clinical symptoms. The Bossmann group has developed ultrasensitive nanobiosensors for protease/arginase detection comprised of Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles, cyanine 5.5, and designer peptide sequences linked to TCPP. Initial data obtained from both gene expression analysis and protease/arginase activity detection in serum indicated the feasibility of early pancreatic cancer detection. Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, -1, -3, and -9), cathepsins (CTS) B and E, neutrophil elastase, and urokinase plaminogen activator (uPA) have been identified as candidates for proximal biomarkers. In this study, we have confirmed our initial results from 2018 performing serum sample analysis assays using a larger group sample size (n = 159), which included localized (n=33) and metastatic pancreatic cancer (n=50), pancreatitis (n=26), and an age-matched healthy control group (n=50). The data obtained from the eight nanobiosensors capable of ultrasensitive protease and arginase activity measurements were analyzed by means of an optimized information fusion-based hierarchical decision structure. This permits the modeling of early-stage detection of pancreatic cancer as a multi-class classification problem. The most striking result is that this methodology permits the detection of localized pancreatic cancers from serum analyses with around 96% accuracy.",

There is an alarming potential for this infection to progress into gastric cancer if left unaddressed. However, the efficacy of conventional treatments is undermined by the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance and the necessity for complex multidrug and high-dose therapeutic regimens. Furthermore, the presence of factors such as biofilm formation, efflux pumps, and gene mutations significantly elevates the risk of treatment failure. In view of these significant challenges, contemporary drug delivery systems represent a vital adjunct in the battle against H. pylori. These advanced and sophisticated systems offer significant advantages, including enhanced drug protection, controlled release, and targeted delivery to specific tissues. Nanoparticles, in particular, show promise in combating H. pylori infection through a variety of mechanisms, including direct drug delivery into the bacteria and the destruction of bacterial walls, as well as generation of free radicals. This review provides an overview of the current therapeutic landscape, including both existing and evolving treatment options. It delves into the transformative potential of novel drug delivery systems, including micro- and nanoparticles, to play a transformative role in the complex field of H. pylori infection treatment. By examining the complex relationship between infection dynamics and cutting-edge delivery technologies, this review seeks to identify avenues for more effective and targeted interventions against this persistent threat. As our understanding of H. pylori infection advances, new treatments and enhanced drug delivery methods offer the prospect of a more effective and personalized approach to combating this persistent health problem.

A number of molecules are involved in this process, with Survivin being one such molecule that is known to control it. The expression of Survivin has been observed in a range of embryonic and adult tissues with a high rate of turnover, as well as in tissue sections of oral precancerous and cancerous lesions. However, data regarding the detection of Survivin in saliva are scarce. The aim of this study is to estimate and compare salivary Survivin levels (SSL) in normal oral mucosa (NOM), oral leukoplakia (OL), and squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in order to demonstrate its potential as a predictive biomarker. Whole saliva samples were collected from all subjects and assessed for salivary Survivin levels using the ELISA technique. A Kruskal-Wallis test was employed to ascertain any significant differences in SSL. The mean SSL in the control group was found to be 301.9\u00b1180.35 ng/dl, while the study groups of OL and OSCC exhibited mean values of 285\u00b1140.4 and 316.5\u00b1176.72 ng/dl, respectively. In the OL group, the highest value was observed in cases of severe dysplasia (407.4 ng/dl), while in the OSCC group, the highest value was noted in WDSCC (311.5 ng/dl). Due to the inconsistency in the distribution of the sample, our findings were found to be non-significant (p = 0.796). This study is the first to detect Survivin in normal oral mucosa (NOM). The results suggest that Survivin plays a definitive role in maintaining the normal homeostasis of oral mucosa. The gradual upregulation and downregulation of SSL in OL and OSCC can be used to predict the aggressive nature of the malignancy. Therefore, the detection of Survivin in saliva can be utilized as a predictive marker for the progression of oral precancerous and cancerous lesions.",

The current pandemic has resulted in a significant reallocation of health-care resources, with the recommended treatment strategy advocating for oncology patients was to delay elective procedures. A retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluatethe impact of COVID-19 on patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the associated treatment protocols. A retrospective review of the inpatient and outpatient records of all patients presenting with renal cell carcinoma during the period from March 2020 to the end of March 2021 was conducted. A total of 26 patients (21 males and 5 females) with a mean age of 55.46\u00b19.44 years were diagnosed with an operable renal mass during the study period. The mean hospitalisation period (15.19\u00b12.28) was found to be longer in patients who required surgical intervention. The delay was attributable to a number of factors, including the necessity for pre-operative testing using RT-PCR, a chest HR-CT, clearance from the chest physician, and preparation. The overall cost of hospitalization increased in these patients compared to the pre-pandemic period due to a number of factors, including prolonged hospitalization, an increased incidence of complications, the necessity for pre-operative testing for SARS-CoV-2, the use of personal protective equipment, and the provision of nursing care. During the same period, three out of eight patients who had metastatic disease with positive RT-PCR were initiated on targeted therapy, while the remaining underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy. The study concludes that patients with RCC seeking treatment during the current pandemic face significant challenges, including delays in treatment, increased hospitalization rates, and a rise in testing, which collectively contribute to elevated treatment costs. It is imperative to conduct a long-term follow-up to ascertain whether these factors have influenced the outcome of the patients in question.",

Guidelines recommend timely screening and surveillance of UC and Crohn's patients, and it is usually timed from the initial diagnosis. This helps with early detection of dysplasia and CRC in this subset of patients, thus allowing for earlier intervention. However, dysplasia is not always easy to discern and management of CRC in each patient may differ. A multidisciplinary approach should be adopted in managing CRC in IBD. Although the oncologic principles of managing sporadic CRC and IBD-CRC are the same, surgical resection should be tailored to each patient.",

Although systemic therapy remains the backbone of palliative treatment, select patients may be candidates for surgical resection with curative intent. Given increasing evidence of the association between metastasectomy and prolonged survival, surgery has acquired an increasingly central role in the management of liver, lung, and peritoneal metastases. This is compounded by accumulating advances in local and systemic treatments that have allowed for expansion of the resectability pool, bringing the potential for curative surgical treatment to increasing numbers of patients with stage IV disease. However, as the boundaries of resectability are pushed, patient selection and consideration of tumor-related and technical factors are imperative to the identification of patients for whom surgery would be of the greatest benefit.",

        "AbstractText": "Mobile phones continuously monitor and evaluate indicators of the received signal strengths from surrounding base stations to optimise wireless services. These signal strength indicators (SSIs) offer the potential for assessing radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure on a population scale, as they can be related to exposure from both base stations and handset devices. Within the ETAIN (Exposure To electromAgnetic fields and plaNetary health) project, an open-access RF-EMF exposure app for smartphones, named \"ETAIN 5G-Scientist\", has been developed using citizen science. This paper delineates a measurement protocol for deriving formulas to convert the app SSIs into electric field values to estimate RF-EMF exposure. It presents pilot study results from measurements taken at four locations in France (FR), and 14 locations in the Netherlands (NL), using three different phone models and the most common network providers in each country. The measurements were conducted while executing different usage scenarios, such as calls or data transmission. The exposimeter ExpoM-RF4 and on-body electric field probes were used to measure exposure from far-field sources and the handset, respectively. Two-minute aggregates were considered the sample unit for analyses (n=891 in NL, n=395 in FR). Regression analyses showed a positive log-linear relationship between Long Term Evolution (LTE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and far-field RF-EMF exposure when aggregating data by location (coefficients for normalised RSSI: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.55 - 1.28] in FR, 1.09 [95% CI: 0.96 - 1.22] in NL). Negative log-linear trends were observed for handset-related RF-EMF exposure at the ear (-0.31 [95% CI: -0.46 - -0.16]) and chest (-0.20 [95% CI: -0.37 - -0.03]) during data transmission scenarios. These results demonstrate that the ETAIN 5G-Scientist app can be implemented for smartphone-based RF-EMF estimation. However, uncertainties in individual measurement points highlight the need for further data collection and analysis to improve the accuracy of exposure estimates.",

        "AbstractText": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The 2015 American Thyroid Association pediatric differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) guidelines recommend posttherapy whole body scan (PTS) 4-7 days after (Iodine-131) I-131 activity administration. There is no recommendation of timing of performing a diagnostic whole-body scan (Dx-WBS). However, this 4-7 day time frame for PTS lacks a solid basis and is essentially arbitrary. This is especially crucial as it has the potential to significantly impact patient management. Our primary goal in this study was to establish the optimal timing for both Dx-WBS and PTS in pediatric and young adult patients with DTC. METHODS: The DTC patients aged \u226421 years underwent serial whole-body scan (WBS) at 24 h, 48 h, and/or 72 h or more after the administration of diagnostic and therapeutic activities of I-131. The utility of Dx-WBS and PTS was assessed based on the identification of new lesions that could potentially influence the prescribed therapeutic activity of I-131. The optimal timing for acquiring Dx-WBS and PTS was determined based on when the first lesion appeared in the I-131 WBS. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (27 males and 68 females) with an average age of 17.9 \u00b1 3 years received a 74 MBq I-131 for Dx-WBS. Ten patients (10.5%) showed no uptake in Dx-WBS, thus, no I-131 therapy was given. The remaining 85 patients received a therapeutic activity of 1.11-5.55 GBq I-131 based on the extent of their disease. The serial Dx-WBS or PTS showed no additional lesions in patients with thyroid remnants. However, additional nodes were detected in 2/32 patients in the \u226548 h Dx-WBS, and 1/32 patients in the known nodal disease patients, which were not clinically relevant. Importantly, 72 h PTS picked up pulmonary metastases in 17.6% (3 out of 17) of patients, which were missed in serial Dx-WBS. However, >72 h PTS did not have additional value. CONCLUSION: I-131 Dx-WBS is best to be performed at 48 h, and PTS at 72 h in pediatric and young adult patients with DTC.",

        "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: Cadmium, a carcinogenic and toxic substance released into the environment, has emerged as a potent activator of lysine-63 ubiquitination, and lysine-63 is a crucial regulator of signal transduction pathways. Although critical, very little information is currently available about how the activation of lysine 63 ubiquitination by Cd might contribute to cancers and inflammatory diseases. The present study provides the first evidence that Cd stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha, a transcription factor, under normoxic conditions via lysine 63 ubiquitination. Cd induces the accumulation of lysine\u00a063\u00a0polyubiquitinated proteins. Importantly, Cd-induced ubiquitination does not prevent oxidative damage or proteasome impairment. Instead, we demonstrated that Cd activates lysine 63 ubiquitination and amplifies its accumulation by overloading the capacity of the autophagy pathway, thus promoting endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell death. At the molecular level, Cd-induced lysine 63 polyubiquitination is correlated with the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha, which translocates into the nucleus and promotes the expression of oncogenes such as interleukin 8 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Strikingly, prolonged cell exposure to high Cd concentrations induces increased lysine-63 polyubiquitination, which promotes aggresome formation, thus preventing this protein from interacting with its downstream nuclear targets. Our results showed that Cd is an activator of K63-linked ubiquitination that stabilizes and promotes the accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1, which blocks autophagy, thus resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, a small amount of HIF-1\u03b1 was observed in the nucleus. We therefore propose that the aberrant activation of lysine\u00a063 polyubiquitination by the carcinogen Cd could promote cell proliferation and inflammation at low levels, while high levels lead to cell death.

The carboxyl-terminal modulator protein 1 (CTMP1) inhibits PKB, primarily by attenuating its phosphorylation. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an irreversible, chronic, progressive pulmonary disorder; the clinical treatment options are limited. Of the various experimental models, bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis is the most extensively studied. It closely resembles human lung fibrosis. We explored the impact of CTMP1 on bleomycin-induced fibrosis. In vitro experiments involved knockdown of CTMP1 in A549 cells (human alveolar epithelial cells), followed by bleomycin treatment. In vivo, lung fibrosis was induced in mice with ablated CTMP1 via intratracheal bleomycin administration at 2\u00a0mg/kg. CTMP1 deletion reduced pulmonary fibrosis and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by inhibiting PKB phosphorylation. These findings suggest that CTMP1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of lung fibrosis, offering new insights into potential therapeutic approaches for IPF patients.

Therefore, molecular targets within this pathway represent promising opportunities for the development of novel BC therapies. This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms by which natural compounds modulate the Hh signaling pathway in BC. By conducting a comprehensive review of various natural compounds, including polyphenols, terpenes, and alkaloids, we reveal both common and unique regulatory mechanisms that influence this pathway. This investigation represents the first comprehensive analysis of five distinct mechanisms through which natural compounds modulate key molecules within the Hh pathway and their impact on the aggressive behaviors of BC. Furthermore, by exploring the structure-activity relationships between these compounds and their molecular targets, we shed light on the specific structural features that enable natural compounds to interact with various components of the Hh pathway. These novel insights contribute to advancing the development and clinical application of natural compound-based therapeutics.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of deep learning-based classification of gallbladder lesions on US images in patients with non-diagnostic US secondary to gallbladder factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with non-diagnostic US due to calculi within the gallbladder lumen, obscuring the detailed evaluation, were identified by a research fellow from a prospective database of patients with gallbladder lesions. The US reports and images were evaluated by a radiologist blinded to the final diagnosis. Patients who had the final pathological diagnosis based on fine-needle aspiration cytology, percutaneous or endoscopic biopsy, or surgical histopathology were included. Convolution neural networks (ResNet50, GBCNet), transformer models (vision transformer [ViT], RadFormer), and a hybrid model (MedViT) were trained on a public gallbladder dataset (GBCU dataset). The performance of these models for classifying gallbladder lesions into benign and malignant was tested on non-diagnostic (GB-RADS 0) US images. RESULTS: Training and validation cohorts (GBCU dataset) comprised 1004 and 251 images, respectively. The testing data (26 patients, mean age [SD]: 57.5 \u00b18.07 years, 17 female) comprised 304 images.

Deficiency of SLC27A5 promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is strongly associated with a poor prognosis. SLC27A5 exhibits noncanonical functions beyond its metabolic role; however, its specific mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis remain elusive and are therefore investigated in this study. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis showed that SLC27A5-interacting proteins were significantly enriched in alternative polyadenylation (APA). RNA-sequencing data provided evidence that SLC27A5 plays a global role in regulating APA events in HCC. Mechanistically, SLC27A5 facilitates the usage of the proximal polyadenylation site of METTL14 by downregulating the expression of the APA-associated factor PABPC1, resulting in the shortening of the METTL14-3'UTR and the conversion of METTL14-UL to METTL14-US. In contrast to METTL14-UL, METTL14-US escapes the inhibitory effect of miRNA targeting, leading to increased METTL14 expression. METTL14-US upregulation by SLC27A5 suppressed the stemness of HCC. Therefore, low levels of SLC27A5 and METTL14 may serve as reliable biomarkers for identifying poor prognosis in patients with HCC. In conclusion, SLC27A5/PABPC1 inhibits HCC stemness via APA-regulated expression of METTL14, providing potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

Alternatively, indirect targeting of MYC represents a more pragmatic therapeutic approach, mainly including inhibition of the transcriptional or translational processes of MYC, destabilization of the MYC protein, and blocking genes that are synthetically lethal with MYC overexpression.

Thus, it is of great significance to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HCC and seek biomarkers for early diagnosis. Neddylation, one of the most conserved post-translational modification types in eukaryotes, plays vital roles in the progression of HCC. During the process of neddylation, NEDD8 is covalently conjugated to its substrate proteins, thereby modulating multiple necessary biological processes. Currently, increasing evidence shows that the aberrant activation of neddylation is positively correlated with the occurrence and development of tumors and the poor clinical prognosis of HCC patients. Based on the current investigations, neddylation modification has been reported to target both the cullins and non-cullin substrates and subsequently affect HCC progression, including the virus infection, malignant transformation, tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion ability, and tumor microenvironment. Therefore, inhibitors targeting the neddylation cascade have been developed and entered clinical trials, indicating satisfactory anti-HCC treatment effects. This review aims to summarize the latest progress in the molecular mechanism of pathologically aberrant neddylation in HCC, as well as the advances of neddylation-targeted inhibitors as potential drugs for HCC treatment.",

Bcl6 deficiency impairs the lineage stability of Treg cells by down-regulating the histone H3K4 trimethylation.

        "AbstractText": "Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of enzymes detoxifying various harmful compounds by conjugating them with glutathione. While primarily beneficial, dysregulation of GST activity or specific isoforms can contribute to disease pathogenesis. The intricate balance of detoxification processes regulated by GSTs is pivotal in cellular homeostasis, whereby dysregulation in these mechanisms can have profound implications for human health. Certain GSTs neutralize carcinogens, shielding cells and potentially preventing tumorigenesis. Polymorphisms in specific GSTs may result in the accumulation of toxic metabolites, exacerbating oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage, notably observed in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. They can also modulate signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis, with aberrant activity potentially contributing to uncontrolled cell growth and resistance to cell death, thus promoting cancer development. They may also contribute to autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory conditions. This knowledge is useful for designing therapeutic interventions and understanding chemoresistance due to GST polymorphisms. A variety of GST inhibitors have been developed and investigated, with researchers actively working on new inhibitors aimed at preventing off-target effects. By leveraging knowledge of the involvement of specific GST isoforms in disease pathogenesis across different populations, more effective and targeted therapeutics can be designed to enhance patient care and improve treatment outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate the generation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) by participating in the reverse splicing of circRNA and thereby influencing circRNA function in cells and diseases, including cancer. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the circRNA-RBP network plays a complex and multifaceted role in tumor progression. Thus, a better understanding of this network may provide new insights for the discovery of cancer drugs. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of RBPs and circRNAs and how the circRNA-RBP network regulates tumor cell phenotypes such as proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, metabolism, immunity, drug resistance, and the tumor environment. Moreover, we investigate the factors that influence circRNA-RBP interactions and the regulation of downstream pathways related to tumor development, such as the tumor microenvironment and N6-methyladenosine modification. Furthermore, we discuss new ideas for targeting circRNA-RBP interactions using various RNA technologies.",

FAO is tightly regulated by multiple evolutionarily conserved mechanisms, and any dysregulation can predispose to cancer development. In this view, we summarize recent findings to provide an updated understanding of the multifaceted roles of FAO in tumor development, metastasis, and the response to cancer therapy.

        "AbstractText": "AIMS: This study aimed to determine the clinical relevance of the influence of coadministration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) on the analgesic effects of opioids, focusing on the amount of change in opioid dosage. METHODS: This study used data from patients who used opioids during anticancer therapy at the Oita University Hospital between September 2014 and October 2023. The primary outcome measure was the amount of change in morphine mg equivalent opioid dose during the period of anticancer therapy. Propensity score matching was performed to reduce confounding effects. RESULTS: The study enrolled 235 patients; 101 received ICI and 134 received no ICI. Before propensity score matching, there were significant differences between the ICI and non-ICI groups in lines of anticancer therapy, type of primary cancer, body mass index, maximum opioid dose and the amount of change in opioid dose. Following propensity score matching, 73 patients each were included in the ICI and non-ICI groups. Analysis of the propensity score-matched cohort showed a significant increase in the median amount of change in opioid dose in ICI group vs non-ICI group (22.5 vs. 15.0 morphine mg equivalents, interquartile range; 0.0, 40.0 vs. 0.0, 30.0, P\u00a0=\u2009.044). Multiple regression analysis identified ICI administration and body mass index as significant independent factors associated with the amount of change in opioid dose (P\u00a0=\u2009.014 and .027, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: ICI administration significantly increased opioid dosage regardless of patient background. Our findings would provide valuable insight into future pain management strategies.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Multi-omic features and clustering phenotypes of circulating tumor cells associated with metastasis and clinical outcomes.",
        "AbstractText": "Metastasis is a lethal disease of cancer, spreading from primary tumors to the bloodstream as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which disseminate to distant organs at low efficiency for secondary tumor regeneration, thereby contributing to unfavorable patient outcomes. The detection of dynamic CTC alterations can be indicative of cancer progression (residual cancer, aggressiveness, therapy resistance) or regression (therapy response), serving as biomarkers for diagnoses and prognoses. CTC heterogeneity is impacted by both intrinsic oncogenic changes and extrinsic microenvironmental factors (e.g. the immune system and circadian rhythm), altering the genomic/genetic, epigenomic/epigenetic, proteomic, post-translational, and metabolomic landscapes. In addition to homeostatic dynamics, regenerative stemness, and metabolic plasticity, a newly discovered feature of CTCs that influences metastatic outcomes is its intercellular clustering. While the dogma suggests that CTCs play solo as single cells in the circulation, CTCs can orchestrate with other CTCs or white blood cells to form homotypic or heterotypic multi-cellular clusters, with 20-100 times enhanced metastatic potential than single CTCs. CTC clusters promote cell survival and stemness through DNA hypomethylation and signaling pathways activated by clustering-driving proteins (CD44, CD81, ICAM1, Podocalyxin, etc). Heterotypic CTC clusters may protect CTCs from immune cell attacks if not being cleared by cytotoxic immune cells. This chapter mainly focused on CTC biology related to multi-omic features and metastatic outcomes. We speculate that CTCs could guide therapeutic targeting and be targeted specifically by anti-CTC therapeutics to reduce or eliminate cancer and cancer metastasis.",

Epigenetic alterations and especially DNA methylation have a high potential to provide valuable and innovative cancer biomarkers. Liquid biopsy is a unique minimally invasive tool for the management of cancer patients based on the extraction of information through detailed molecular analysis of circulating genetic material in peripheral blood and allows us to characterize the evolution of a solid tumor in real time. DNA methylation in combination with liquid biopsy is very powerful when it comes to providing circulating epigenetic biomarkers of clinical importance. Numerous DNA methylation markers are now being tested in liquid biopsies as potential biomarkers in various types of cancer. DNA methylation is mostly being studied in ctDNA but there are also a small number of studies up to now performed in gDNA isolated from CTCs. A highly important dimension of the combination of liquid biopsy/DNA methylation analysis is its high potential for early cancer detection since alterations in DNA methylation in plasma can be detected very early during cancer pathogenesis. Methylated DNA, modified nucleosomes and noncoding RNAs can be used as blood circulating epigenetic biomarkers for real-time and minimally-invasive cancer monitoring. DNA methylation is very promising and powerful in providing novel biomarkers for improving cancer diagnostics, while another important dimension in this field is the use of DNA methylation inhibitors in cancer treatment. In this chapter we present the current findings on epigenetic alterations detected in CTCs in various types of cancer, and further discuss their potential as novel liquid biopsy-based DNA methylation biomarkers.",

        "AbstractText": "Circulating tumor cells (CTC), released by primary tumors into the bloodstream, represent a valuable source to inform on cancer heterogeneity, cancer progression, metastatic disease and therapy efficacy without the need of invasive tumor biopsies. However, the extreme rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs, occurring at genotypic, phenotypic and functional levels, poses a major challenge for the study of this population and explains the lack of standardized strategies of CTC isolation. Lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, is a paradigmatic example of how CTC heterogeneity can undermine the clinical utility of this biomarker, since contrasting data have been reported using different isolation technologies. Some evidences suggest that only a fraction of CTC, characterized by stem-like feature and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, can sustain metastasis initiation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have the potential to maintain primary tumors, initiate metastasis and escape both chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments. Moreover, a close connection has been reported in several tumor types among hybrid phenotype, characterized by retention of epithelial and mesenchymal traits, acquisition of CSC feature and increased metastatic potential. This review focuses on the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of CTCs and the resulting implications for their isolation and clinical validation, especially in the setting of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, we discuss the most relevant studies providing evidence for the presence and prognostic/predictive value of CTC subsets characterized by stem-like and hybrid EMT phenotype. Despite technical and conceptual issues, tracking circulating CSCs has the potential to improve the prognostic/predictive value of CTCs in NSCLC setting and could provide novel insights into the comprehension of the metastatic process and identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

Instead, cancer suppression may have emerged as an evolutionary byproduct, or \"spandrel\". We propose a novel evolutionary perspective that highlights the importance of somatic maintenance as the underlying axis of natural selection.

        "AbstractText": "Objective: To develop and explore the clinical value of a nomogram model for the preoperative diagnosis of proliferative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: The preoperative Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI data and clinical pathological data of patients with pathologically confirmed proliferative (178 cases) and non-proliferative type HCC (378 cases) from September 2017 to November 2022 were retrospectively collected. The MRI features and clinicopathological features of proliferative and non-proliferative type HCC were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictive factors of proliferative-type HCC. The nomogram prediction model was constructed using R software. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to evaluate its diagnostic efficacy. The calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) were drawn to evaluate the calibration performance and clinical application value of the nomogram model. The optimal threshold for distinguishing high-risk from low-risk was determined using the Youden index. The survival prognosis of proliferative and non-proliferative type HCC was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and the log-rank test. The measurement data were analyzed using the independent sample t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test. The count data were compared using the \u03c72 test. Results: There were statistically significant differences in alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (\u03c72=17.244, P<0.001), tumor morphology (\u03c72=13.669, P<0.001), intratumoral fatty degeneration (\u03c72=10.495, P=0.001), abnormal enhancement of peritumoral abnormalities during arterial phase (\u03c72=37.662, P<0.001), tumor capsule (\u03c72=23.961, P<0.001), intratumoral necrosis (\u03c72=77.184,P<0.001), intratumoral hemorrhage (\u03c72=4.892,P=0.027), peritumoral hypointense in hepatobiliary phase (\u03c72=47.675,P<0.001), rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (\u03c72=115.976,P<0.001), intratumoral artery (\u03c72=15.528,P<0.001) and intravenous tumor thrombus (\u03c72=10.532,P=0.001) between proliferative and non-proliferative type HCC groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that AFP>200 \u03bcg/L (OR=1.561, P=0.044), no intratumoral fatty degeneration (OR=1.947, P=0.033), intratumoral necrosis (OR=2.084, P=0.003), peritumoral hypointensity in the hepatobiliary phase (OR=2.314, P=0.001), and annular hyperenhancement in the arterial phase (OR=5.557, P<0.001) were independent predictors for preoperative diagnosis of proliferative-type HCC. A nomogram model for preoperative prediction of proliferative type HCC was constructed based on the independent predictors. The area under the ROC curve model for predicting proliferative-type HCC was 0.772 (95%CI: 0.735-0.807), with a sensitivity of 69.1% and a specificity of 75.4%. The calibration curve and DCA curve showed superior calibration performance and clinical applicability of the nomogram model. The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that the recurrence free survival rate after liver resection was significantly lower in patients with proliferative-type HCC than that of non-proliferative-type HCC (P<0.001), and the high-risk group was significantly lower than the low-risk group (P<0.001). Conclusions: The construction of a nomogram model based on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI features combined with AFP >200\u03bcg/L can accurately diagnose proliferative-type HCC and predict its preoperative prognosis.",

DESIGN: This population-based cohort study included 1,126,058 naturally conceived singleton live births (21,644 with and 1,104,414 without a major non-chromosomal defect) who were born between 2004 and 2018 in New York, Texas, Massachusetts and North Carolina. All study children were linked to their respective state birth defect registries to identify major birth defects diagnosed within the first year of life, and to state death records. Children with chromosomal defects were excluded. Genitourinary defects were only evaluated in boys. Placental and bleeding issues included placenta previa, placental abruption, uterine bleeding and other excessive bleeding, and, at delivery, blood transfusion or unplanned hysterectomy. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were modelled using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among major non-chromosomal defects, the highest significant risks were with pre-gestational diabetes (adjusted OR 2.48, 95% CI 2.25 to 2.74), followed by placental or bleeding issues (adjusted OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.66 to 1.99); this pattern was also evident for congenital heart defects, blastogenesis defects, orofacial defects, gastrointestinal defects and musculoskeletal defects. Hypertension (pre-gestational and gestational), prior caesarean delivery, older maternal age and higher body mass index were also significant risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors most strongly associated with major non-chromosomal birth defects were pre-gestational diabetes and placental or bleeding issues; other significantly increased risks were hypertension (pre-gestational and gestational), prior caesarean delivery, older maternal age and pre-pregnancy body mass index 30 kg/m2 or above.",

        "AbstractText": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) act as crucial regulators of gene expression within cells, exerting precise control over processes such as RNA splicing, transport, localization, stability, and translation through their specific binding to RNA molecules. The diversity and complexity of RBPs are particularly significant in cancer biology, as they directly impact a multitude of RNA metabolic events closely associated with tumor initiation and progression. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), as a member of the RBP family, is central to the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome and increasingly recognized in the modulation of cancer biology through its influence on RNA metabolism. The protein's versatility, stemming from its diverse RNA-binding domains, enables it to govern a wide array of transcript processing events. Modifications in FMRP's expression or localization have been associated with the regulation of mRNAs linked to various processes pertinent to cancer, including tumor proliferation, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cellular senescence, chemotherapy/radiotherapy resistance, and immunotherapy evasion. In this review, we emphasize recent findings and analyses that suggest contrasting functions of this protein family in tumorigenesis. Our knowledge of the proteins that are regulated by FMRP is rapidly growing, and this has led to the identification of multiple targets for therapeutic intervention of cancer, some of which have already moved into clinical trials or clinical practice.",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Globally, there are 55 million people living with dementia (PLWD). PLWD have an uncertain prognosis. Most are approaching the end of life but are not overtly or immediately dying. Contemporary approaches to dementia care therefore promote the need to live and die well with dementia. Pain is highly prevalent but difficult to manage in PLWD. Originating in palliative care, \"total pain\" conceives of pain holistically, incorporating biological, psychological, social and spiritual elements. Pain management in dementia care tends to be pharmacologically focused. Total pain therefore offers an alternative approach-one consistent with person-centred philosophy underpinning contemporary dementia care. Due to important differences, concepts cannot simply be extrapolated from cancer-related to dementia-related palliative care however. Dementia-specific approaches are needed and require exploration. DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE OF THE ANALYSIS: The objective of this paper is to explore the meaning of total pain in the context of living and dying with dementia, and its utility and implications for person-centred dementia care. Using a palliative care framework and existing literature, we critically consider the bio-psycho-socio-spiritual impact of dementia, to explore how total pain might manifest and be experienced in this context. FINDINGS AND INTERPRETATION: We highlight the complexity, nuance and socially contingent nature of the impact of living and dying with dementia. We challenge binary understandings of \"continuity or loss\" (e.g., of identity, relationships), and totalising \"loss\" discourses, demonstrating that more subtle, varied and hopeful outcomes are possible. The way that the impact of dementia is articulated and understood has implications for the experience and management of total pain. The deficit-orientation of \"total pain\" paradoxically risks its perpetuation. A balanced understanding of dementia's impact (acknowledging both continuity and loss, alternatives and socially constructed aspects) better reflects the realities of dementia and creates new possibilities for supportive care practices to improve pain management and quality of life. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Applied to dementia care, \"total pain\" should be located within a critical context, emphasising complexity, contingency and nuance. The holistic focus of \"total pain\" should be extended to incorporate balanced consideration of \"painful\" and \"functional\" experience. We introduce a balanced model of total pain incorporating a dual focus on \"pain\" and \"personhood\" within a critical context, to facilitate translation to practice. There is a need to develop evidence-based supportive interventions in each domain of total pain, to support a balanced approach to total pain management in dementia care.",

        "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: A 63-year-old female patient with a history of postoperative recurrence of breast cancer after radiation therapy underwent chemotherapy with epirubicin (total 960\u202fmg) and low-dose cyclophosphamide. She developed acute decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Despite initial treatment with diuretics and inotropic drugs, her condition worsened, leading to low-output syndrome and frequent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient underwent an endomyocardial biopsy and catheter ablation for AF. The endomyocardial biopsy revealed predominant lymphocyte invasion rather than cardiomyocyte injury, indicating drug-induced chronic lymphocytic myocarditis. The clinical course and biopsy findings indicated that other potential causes were unlikely, such as viral infection, collagen disease, and immune checkpoint inhibitor use. Following steroid pulse therapy, maintenance therapy with a starting dose of 80\u202fmg of methylprednisolone (mPSL) led to a significant improvement in hemodynamics, resulting in her discharge on the 82nd day with an improved ejection fraction from 20\u202f% to 42\u202f%. A second endomyocardial biopsy under 20\u202fmg of mPSL showed a marked improvement in lymphocytic infiltration. This case serves to illustrate the significance of endomyocardial biopsy in the context of refractory heart failure with an onco-cardiology case, whereby an appropriate diagnosis can be made and successful steroid therapy can be initiated. LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Although heart failure after chemotherapy is frequently reported, reports of chronic lymphocytic myocarditis after chemotherapy are relatively uncommon. Endomyocardial biopsy has enabled the differential diagnosis of cardiac toxicity and has led to the diagnosis of lymphocytic myocarditis. Currently, the optimal treatment for chronic lymphocytic myocarditis remains unestablished. However, in this case, it was found that steroid therapy was effective.",

The secondary objective of the study was to investigate whether CLUE played a role in the treatment response and to examine its correlation with the other measures of lymphedema. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2019 and June 2019, a total of 40 patients (2 males, 38 females; mean age: 57.8\u00b112.5 years; range, 45 to 70 years) who were diagnosed with unilateral Stage 2-3 BCRL and underwent treatment were included. The patients' upper extremity volumes were assessed and the patients were evaluated with the CLUE score, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Outcome Measure (QuickDASH) score, BIS, and hand grip strength before and after the complete decongestive therapy. RESULTS: Correlation analyses revealed that CLUE total score and BIS values were correlated with the reduction in the volumes (p=0.04 and p<0.001, respectively). The CLUE total score was also found to be positively correlated with the BIS values (p<0.001). Hand grip strength and QuickDASH scores were not found to be correlated with the changes in the volume and CLUE total scores. CONCLUSION: The development of a structured clinical assessment such as CLUE provides clinicians for a standardized evaluation for BCRL.

The hopelessness level was higher in caregivers of patients with lymphedema compared to healthy controls (p=0.011). No statistically meaningful difference was found in CQOL-C burden, disruptiveness, positive adaptation, or financial concerns subscales in caregivers of patients with and without lymphedema (p=0.697, p=0.209, p=0.823, p=0.855, and p=0.257, respectively). Continuous caregiving was negatively associated with the total CQOL-C score in caregivers of patients with lymphedema (p=0.031). Complex decongestive therapy was negatively associated with high BAI and BHS scores (p=0.038 and p=0.034, respectively). CONCLUSION: Lymphedema has a negative impact on hopelessness, while complex decongestive therapy has positive effects on anxiety and depression. Continuous caregiving may be considered a risk factor for high total CQOL-C scores.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Benchmark Dose Estimation from Transcriptomics Data for Methylimidazolium Ionic Liquid Hepatotoxicity: Implications for Health Risk Assessment of Green Solvents.",
        "AbstractText": "Ionic liquids (ILs), traditionally considered environmentally benign solvents, have shown potential toxicity to organisms, raising concerns about their safety. Among them, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium (M8OI) has been detected at high concentrations in soils and exhibits hepatotoxic properties. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying this toxicity, whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed, coupled with benchmark dose (BMD) modeling, to derive transcriptomic points-of-departure (tPOD) through dose-response analysis. The transcriptomic analysis identified 425, 667, and 567 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following low (10 \u03bcmol/L), medium (50 \u03bcmol/L), and high (200 \u03bcmol/L) doses of M8OI exposure, respectively. Enrichment analysis revealed significant perturbations in pathways related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and IL-17 signaling. BMD modeling yielded tPOD values of 1.51 \u03bcmol/L (median of the 20 most sensitive genes, omicBMD20), 2.98 \u03bcmol/L (tenth percentile of all genes, omicBMD10th), 6.83 \u03bcmol/L (mode of the first peak of all gene BMDs, omicBMDmode), and 5.9 \u03bcmol/L for pathway-level analysis. These transcriptomics-derived tPODs were at least 105-fold lower than M8OI's hepatotoxic concentration, as indicated by its EC50 of 723.6 \u03bcmol/L in HepG2 cells. Functional analysis of the transcriptomic data identified legionellosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer as the most sensitive pathways affected by M8OI. These findings highlight the molecular mechanisms driving M8OI-induced hepatotoxicity and underscore the utility of transcriptomics in deriving sensitive and quantitative toxicity thresholds. The results provide critical insights for guideline-driven toxicological evaluations and regulatory decision-making, supporting a more comprehensive assessment of IL safety.",

        "AbstractText": "Primary cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL NOS) denotes lymphomas that do not conform to a recognized entity. Within this category, 3 specific lymphoproliferative diseases had been granted provisional status pending further confirmation of their validity as distinct entities; acral CD8+ lymphoma-recently accepted as acral CD8+ lymphoproliferative disorder-aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma, and CD4+ small-medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. The adoption of stringent diagnostic criteria, which include clinical, morphological, and immunohistochemical data, and some inherent variations of these within individual cases, raises problems as to the boundaries between these tumors and a diagnosis of PTCL NOS. This review discusses the evolution of our knowledge of these tumors and their diagnostic criteria with respect to the wider PTCL NOS category.",
